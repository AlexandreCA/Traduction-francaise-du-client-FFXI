       naught more than a cryptic hint...

      Mission Orders:
       A fight has broken out and
       Gratzigg, the Peacekeepers'

  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       The only thing on Adoulinians' lips
       these days seems to be that the
       city's youth are using the Rala

       By some strange set of coincidences,
       you have been tasked with bringing
       Arciela the fruits of her labors she
       sowed long ago. Perhaps these
       Adoulinian tomatoes are just the
       thing to get you into the castle...

  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       The attempt on Ygnas's life ended
       without any casualties, but the
       offenders have escaped! They did,
       however, leave behind a clue.
       Use it to pursue and bring the
       hammer of justice down upon them!
  26:

  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       An antiquated sluice gate sits in
       the heart of the assassins'
       Rala Waterways lair. According to
       Arciela, you should be able to
       operate it once you have a

      Mission Orders:
       Now that justice has been properly

  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Ingrid has declared that it falls to her
       to break the curse surrounding Ygnas
       so that colonization may proceed

  - string: ____A Curse from the Past
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       The curse upon the grand chancellor
       is more powerful than anyone
       expected. Ingrid has demanded that
       you retrieve four items for her: a
       piece of a stone wall, a vial of

  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Though the purgation ritual ended in
       failure, Ygnas lifted a tiny arm
       and pointed at Arciela, calling her
       "the key." The houses are divided:
       should colonization continue or
       cease?

  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Arciela cannot make heads or tails of
       what her brother wants from her.

       According to Teodor, the girl found
       maundering the Ceizak Battlegrounds
       left her home because she was
       "summoned by spirits." Perhaps
       Arciela has some knowledge to
       impart regarding those who supposedly
       did this summoning.

  - string: ____Evil Entities
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       The girl Arciela describes, who is
       allegedly possessed by evil spirits,
       resembles the girl you discovered in
       the battlegrounds to an exceptional
       degree. Return to the
       Ceizak Battlegrounds to see

      Mission Orders:
       The mysterious girl exhibiting ghoulish

  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Nyline wandered from her home while
       her father was explaining the details
       of her condition. She purportedly
       carries a cryptic stone on her
       journeys, but could that truly be the
       culprit? The answer may very well lie
       deep within the jungle.
  42:

      Mission Orders:
       Now that Nyline has regained lucidity,

      Mission Orders:
       After hearing that your idea sprung
       first from Teodor, Arciela decided to
       approach him about her brother's
       condition. The smile she wore as she

      Mission Orders:
       Rumor has it that Teodor can be

      Mission Orders:
       The priory has declared it will
       dispatch a search party to look for
       Arciela. While most are impressed by
       Vortimere's largesse, Rosulatia's pome
       glows a cautionary shade of red. Head

      Mission Orders:
       By raising Ortharsyne high, Arciela

       Sajj'aka has provided you with a

      Mission Orders:
       Ygnas indicated that the best way to
       heal the World Tree would be by
       grafting the sapling Sajj'aka gave you
       onto it, left you with a vision of a
       strange wooded area, and fell into a
       deep slumber. The Pioneers' Coalition

      Mission Orders:
       Melvien's sudden betrayal has shocked
       Arciela, and Morimar was forced to
       put him down before all was lost.
       Despite this, Rosulatia's ritual was

       An eccentric jester named Balamor
       threw the assembly into an uproar
       with his appearance, then vanished.
       Though the hearing was immediately
       recessed, the castle should open its
       gates again after the situation has
       stabilized.

      Mission Orders:
       The shock of what resulted from
       Balamor's emergence has caused
       Arciela to lock herself away in her
       chambers. Meanwhile, Ygnas has asked
       that his family's heirloom necklace be
       returned, to which Ploh Trishbahk has

      Mission Orders:
       Ygnas was correct, and the evil clown
       was hiding in that tomb. A true
       enigma, Balamor has hidden statue
       segments in the monsters that roam
       the waterways and implores you to
       find them.

       Balamor reveals that Hades is the
       ringleader behind this foul plot, and
       that defeating him will remove the
       curse afflicting so many Adoulinians.
       Before marching into his throne room
