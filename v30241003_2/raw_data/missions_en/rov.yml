       A cryptic vision from the crystal has
       played in your mind. A strange woman
       bathed in light descended from the
       mothercrystal in search of someone.
       What is the land of which she spoke?
       Perhaps someone in Selbina or Mhaura

      Mission Orders:
       The town's leader has informed you
       that Gilgamesh is looking for a
       particular adventurer and that he
       wants some goods. Mhaura: three
       mandragora dewdrops from pygmaioi.

      Mission Orders:
       Gilgamesh claims that he chanced
       upon a young woman while sailing the
       stormy western seas, and wants you
       to meet her in Norg. Speak to his
       crew when you are ready to leave, but
       those with Gilgamesh's letter of

      Mission Orders:
       You have met Iroha, a priestess of
       Reisenjima Sanctorium. She has
       somehow descended from the future,
       and claims that the world will be
       consumed if it continues on its current

      Mission Orders:
       Gilgamesh's daughter, Lion, may be
       able to find something out. Complete
       your home nation's missions up through

       Beyond the vortex a strange world
       unfurls--and it looks not unlike
       Zi'Tah. The place may be what is
       called Escha. Follow the crystal's call

      Mission Orders:
       Lion has seen another vision. The orb
       you received must be filled with
       sufficient light to stop the
       encroaching darkness. Vanquish the
       Shadow Lord before the reckoning

      Mission Orders:
       Ill tidings abound. Something is
       causing sailors to take leave of their
       senses, with a strange ringing
       reminding you of what occurred in

      Mission Orders:
       The great Siren is the cause of the
       recent disturbances plaguing Norg, and
       she claims that Iroha was not the only
       one who came to the present time from
       the future. The masked man
       attacked Iroha, who faded into
       nothingness. Chase after him.

      Mission Orders:
       Siren and the masked man attempted
       to conjure forth another vortex in
       Yuhtunga Jungle in a bid to cause
       Escha to spread further. Fight the
       winged beast and stop her before it's

      Mission Orders:
       Siren has regained her senses and
       shared with you what the future
       holds. Volto Oscuro's power is
       immense, and it will stop at nothing

      Mission Orders:
       A samurai from the Far East, Tenzen,
       has made landfall in Norg, claiming
       the orb can provide guidance to those
       who wield it. This time, a vision bids
       you to head for Delkfutt's Tower.
  21:
  - number: 154

  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Having heard about Tenzen, Iroha has
       headed toward Ru'Lude Gardens in
       Jeuno. However, she warns that you
       must pass the trials posed to you by
       the chains of Promathia to move
       forward. Perhaps a fateful
       meeting awaits you along the way.
  22:

  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Tenzen learned about the darkness
       that the future holds and insists that
       it can be changed. Your bonds with
       him caused the orb to flare up and
       open a new path before you. The next
       step is to meet with Prishe in Port
       Jeuno.
  23:
  - number: 158
  - string: __Numbering Days
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Your bonds with Prishe have helped
       the orb shine a little bit brighter than
       before--yet Iroha is nowhere to be
       seen. Work together with your
       companions to find her.
  24:
  - number: 160
  - string: __Inescapable Binds
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:　
       Iroha was assaulted by the
       ambassador, who stole away the
       blessing of Phoenix. Prishe heard that
       he was off to Aht Urhgan to find the
       Astral Candescence, which could
       prove pivotal. The Tenshodo in Jeuno
       can provide transport to Aht Urhgan.

      Mission Orders:
       Ships to Aht Urhgan regularly depart

  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       You successfully rendezvoused with
       Tenzen in Aht Urhgan, and have been
       tasked with infiltrating the palace, if
       possible, or searching out Gessho and
       joining Salaheem's Sentinels
       otherwise.
  27:
  - number: 168
  - string: __The Endless Sky
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Gessho reported that the ambassador
       snuck into the palace. If you work
       hard at Salaheem's Sentinels, you may
       just be able to earn enough trust with
       the Empire to go in yourself...
  28:
  - number: 170
  - string: __Aphmau's Light
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       You have passed the third challenge
       posed to you, and should make haste
       for the palace in Aht Urhgan. If
       something has happened to Aphmau,
       make sure she is safe before paying
       your respects.
  29:
  - number: 172
  - string: __Reunited
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Aphmau revealed that the
       ambassador's underlings are after the
       Astral Candescence. She has offered
       her aid, and your orb has been filled
       with light once more. Head to Walahra
       Temple's Hall of Binding.
  30:
  - number: 174
  - string: __Take Wing
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       The Hall of Binding was attacked,
       with a masked woman assaulting the
       Candescence. Thankfully, Tenzen and
       Kagero were able to wrest back
       Phoenix's blessing, yet a number of
       Immortals were injured and the woman
       escaped. Return to Shararat Teahouse.
  31:
  - number: 176
  - string: __Prime Number
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       The Astral Candescence was likely
       targeted due to Aht Urhgan's prime
       avatar. They hope to use its power to
       envelop not just the past, but also
       the present. Foil their plot by heading
       to the Alzadaal Undersea Ruins.
  32:
  - number: 178
  - string: __From the Ruins
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Alexander aided Phoenix in reviving
       Iroha. He knows much about the
       encroaching darkness, revealing that
       it's something far more sinister than
       the absence of light. Iroha has been
       brought back to Aht Urhgan to
       recover, where she and Aphmau await.
  33:
  - number: 180

  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       The world has rejected Iroha's
       presence, but Alexander believes Cait
       Sith might have an answer. Cavernous
       maws in either Batallia Downs,
       Rolanberry Fields, or Sauromugue
       Champaign may enable you to meet
       with the enigmatic feline.
  34:

  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Cait Sith gave you a special item
       used to enter the Walk of Echoes
       after hearing your explanation about
       what may come to pass. Enter the
       Walk of Echoes from either Batallia
       Downs, Rolanberry Fields, or
       Sauromugue Champaign.

  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Only Altana can make Vana'diel
       accept Iroha's presence in this world,
       and the first step to reaching her is
       to cull the threats that Vana'diel
       faces. Continue with the Wings of the
       Goddess missions if you have not met
       Lilisette.
  36:
  - number: 191
  - string: __Sacrifice
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Though you have met Lilisette, she
       has no idea how to meet Altana. On
       the bright side, your orb has been
       granted another spark of light. Cait
       Sith has beseeched you for aid,
       saying that the ambassador has
       infiltrated the Walk of Echoes.
  37:

  - string: __Somber Dreams
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       The ambassador threatens to absorb
       dark energy from Atomos and must be
       stopped. His minion Cetus has
       swallowed you whole--vanquish him
       before proceeding.
  38:
  - number: 200
  - string: __Of Light and Darkness
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       You have successfully vanquished
       Cetus, but the ambassador escaped,
       his plan partially successful. Meet
       with Iroha and discuss your next
       plans--but first, head back to Norg.
  39:
  - number: 202
  - string: __Temporary Farewells
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Gilgamesh seemed skittish about a
       new vortex to Escha that opened in
       Misareaux Coast. Iroha journeyed
       there alone, seemingly preferring to
       travel on her own. Head to Misareaux
       Coast and see what you can learn.
  40:
  - number: 204
  - string: __Brushing Up
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Iroha has been off working on her
       inner self, and your recent discussions
       with her have encouraged her to ask
       you for training. Speak with her once
       more.
  41:
  - number: 206
  - string: __Keep On Giving
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Give Iroha a little gift to help
       encourage her to stick to her training
       regimen. The gifts are as follows:
       strength training: a beef stewpot;
       endurance training: a serving of zaru
       soba; style training: 30 spicy
       crackers.
  42:
  - number: 208
  - string: __Past Imperfect
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Though satisfied with her training,
       Iroha's burden remains heavy, and she
       is poised to take on the ambassador
       alone. The two of you have decided
       to seek out the races of eld. Return
       to Norg to discuss things.
  43:
  - number: 209
  - string: __The Cursed Temple
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Gilgamesh has pointed you toward the
       Temple of Uggalepih, where you
       should be able to find clues.
       Depending on your current progress in
       Rise of the Zilart, there may be some
       things you must take care of first.
  44:

  - string: __Wisdom of Our Forefathers
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Grav'iton, one of the few surviving
       Kuluu, has offered to guide you.
       Examine the granite door to see what
       she has to say.
  45:
  - number: 212
  - string: __Where Divinities Collide
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Grav'iton decisively stated that you
       must pass through the crystals in
       order to reach Altana. The logical
       place to start would be in the Crags
       of Holla, Dem, and Mea.
  46:
  - number: 214
  - string: __Visions of Dread
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       The crystals have shown you a vision
       of Selh'teus speaking with higher
       powers. Yet a shocking appearance by
       the ambassador jolted you awake
       without learning more. To where will
       these half-truths lead? Try to sort
       things out.
  47:
  - number: 216
  - string: __To the Skies
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       You discussed the next step with
       Iroha and Tenzen, but ultimately were
       unable to figure out how to meet with
       Altana. Siren's decision to clash with
       the ambassador is of primary concern,
       so head back to Norg to draft your
       next plan of attack.
  48:
  - number: 218
  - string: __Escha - Ru'Aun
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       There have been reports of two Sirens
       prowling Misareaux Coast and Escha -
       Ru'Aun. That seems as good a place
       as any to start.
  49:
  - number: 222
  - string: __The Decisive Heroine
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Siren awaited you in Escha - Ru'Aun,
       where she revealed a startling truth:
       not even Altana is able to stop the
       encroaching darkness and the cloud
       of nothingness. But don't lose heart--
       meeting with Iroha comes first.
  50:
  - number: 224
  - string: __Fall from Grace
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       The Sirens and Iroha were able to
       capture the ambassador, claiming that
       only a communion can banish him
       (and subsequently Iroha and the
       future Siren), but Balamor intervened
       and whisked the ambassador away.
       Take Siren's gift to the crystals.
  51:

  - string: __Banishing the Darkness
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Your best hope to meet Altana is to
       go to Reisenjima. Selh'teus has vowed
       to create a new crystal there to
       banish the Emptiness, and bids you
       seek one with dominion over magic to
       help. A friend in Norg may know
       someone who fits the bill.
  52:
  - number: 228
  - string: __Over the Rainbow
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Iroha claimed that a crystal exists in
       Reisenjima in her future, which should
       be no cause for alarm. Over in Norg,
       your allies have hesitantly encouraged
       you to visit Shantotto in Windurst
       Walls.
  53:

      Mission Orders:
       Shantotto, Koru-Moru, and Yoran-Oran
       discussed Koru-Moru's latest
       experiment, which reacts to the
       presence of darkness--a darkness
       which has settled in Escha - Ru'Aun.

       proceed.

       The dark jester Balamor was working
       to drain the crystals of power in an
       attempt to fashion a new world in his
       image. Fight Balamor to draw his
       attention away from Selh'teus while
       the Kuluu attempts to seal the
       vortex.

      Mission Orders:
       Your victory over Balamor has
       protected the crystals and Selh'teus

       vortex. Return to Norg to check up
       on Iroha.

      Mission Orders:
       What happened to the ambassador
       after Balamor was culled? There is no
       time to rest--try to find a way to

       Gilgamesh and your allies from across
       Vana'diel have gathered in Norg to
       check on you, but Iroha is nowhere to
       be found. She must have been hurled

       You have set foot in Reisenjima at
       long last, reuniting with Iroha in the
       process. She spends each night
       staving off the threat posed by
       narakas in the area. Vanquish three of
       them to buy her some time.
  64:
  - number: 260
  - string: __The River Runs Red
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       With the narakas vanquished, all that
       remains at present is to report back
       to Iroha.
  65:
  - number: 262
  - string: __The Crucible
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Iroha's future provides clues about
       the ambassador. The only way to
       combat his darkness is to gather more
       light for your orb. Your next
       destination is Adoulin. If necessary,
       speak with Darcia in Lower Jeuno to
       start the Seekers of Adoulin missions.
  66:

      Mission Orders:
       You have passed through Iroha's
       fourth gate. Head to Ceizak
       Battlegrounds to learn more.
  67:
  - number: 264
  - string: __Tears of the Generals
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Iroha clashed with the ambassador,
       who claimed that the Reckoning rests
       on the orb activating. Gather
       information about Balamor in Castle
       Adoulin and perhaps glean some clues
       about changing the outcome of the
       Reckoning.
  68:
  - number: 266
  - string: __What He Left Behind
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Arciela has provided information on
       where to find Balamor. Head to Rala
       Waterways and seek out the black
       butterflies.
  69:
  - number: 268
  - string: __Gone but Not Forgotten
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       According to Balamor, the orb Iroha
       gave you has something to do with
       the power of time. He will return what
       he took from you if you bring him a
       relic of the founder king. Look for it
       somewhere in Rala Waterways.
  70:
  - number: 269
  - string: __August Artifacts
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       You have successfully procured the
       founder king's orb. Head back to
       speak with Balamor.

  - string: __Solemnity
  - string: "Mission Orders:\n \"It all began with a stone...\" and what\n the stone's light purged was not the\n Emptiness, but rather the Cloud of\n Darkness. It has no consciousness, \n but is all-encompassing. What does\n Arciela have to say about Balamor's\n musings?"
  72:
  - number: 272
  - string: __Eyes on You
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Arciela, who had been poring over
       tomes in Celennia Memorial Library,
       has an inkling that the Cloud of
       Darkness may be related to ruins
       located in the Middle Lands. Head to
       Li'Telor to investigate.
  73:
  - number: 274
  - string: __Exploring the Ruins
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Deep within Ro'Maeve waited a
       representative of Jeuno--Esha'ntarl.
       She heard the rumors of the coming
       end and was looking to Iroha for
       answers. Follow her lead and head
       further into the ruins.

      Mission Orders:
       Yve'noile claims that only a god can
       stand against the Cloud of Darkness.
       A human may be able to ascend, but
       the ambassador banished her before
       she could explain fully. Head to
       Reisenjima and consult with Selh'teus.
  75:
  - number: 280
  - string: __Unshakable Nightmares
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Part of Selh'teus's crystal must be
       cracked for you to become a god of
       light. What's more, you must also
       purge yourself of the ambassador's
       taint. Head to the Walk of Echoes to
       accomplish the latter task.
  76:
  - number: 282
  - string: __What Remains of Hope
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Cait Sith used the dimensional
       compass to guide you to a fully
       empowered god of darkness, which
       may absorb all of your murk for its
       own ends. Steel yourself for battle
       and head further into the Walk of
       Echoes.
  77:
  - number: 286
  - string: __Death Cares Not
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Cait Sith gave you one of her
       whiskers so that you would not lose
       your way. Progress even further in.
  78:
  - number: 288
  - string: __No Time like the Future
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       The god of darkness is an all-
       encompassing entity in its otherwise
       desolate world. As you hoped,
       it absorbed all the darkness present
       within you--yet it used the opening
       to attack. Take it down.
  79:
  - number: 292
  - string: __Sin
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       It seems the ambassador was
       controlled by the Cloud of Darkness,
       unable to complete its original
       mission. The god of darkness fused
       with it, awakening as an entirely new
       entity. It is beckoning you--go seek
       it out.
  80:
  - number: 296
  - string: __Penance
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       The ambassador has become a dark
       god, showing you what the future
       holds. You split into two pure
       beings--one light, one dark. The dark
       entity became controlled by the
       cloud, bringing him to the present
       day.
  81:
  - number: 298
  - string: __Vessel of Light
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Having purged the darkness and
       learned the truth, you now have the
       potential to become a god of light.
       Return to Selh'teus.
  82:

  - string: __The Lifestream of Reisenjima
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       The god of light--you--and Altana are
       what led Iroha back to the past. To
       meet the Goddess of the Dawn, you
       must first set the disrupted lifestream
       in Reisenjima back on its proper
       course.
  83:
  - number: 302
  - string: __From West to East
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Three of your allies have assembled
       on Reisenjima to help you see things
       to their conclusion: Gilgamesh, Aldo,
       and Tenzen. Work with them to
       vanquish eleven of the panopts
       befouling the natural order.
  84:
  - number: 304
  - string: __Good Things Come in Threes
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       You have succeeded in vanquishing

       entrance of the Sanctorium to meet
       up with your compatriots.
  85:
  - number: 306
  - string: __Tackling the Problem
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Your allies have also succeeded in
       culling their quarry. Return to the
       crystal and report your success to
       Selh'teus and Iroha.
  86:
  - number: 308
  - string: __Way to Divinity
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Your returning the lifestream to its
       pure state has enabled Selh'teus to
       send you to Altana. What lies ahead
       is unclear--make sure you are
       prepared for the journey.
  87:
  - number: 310
  - string: __The Winds of Time
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       You have shed the last vestiges of
       your humanity to become a god of
       light. Altana has revealed the key: the
       fledgling deities of light and darkness
       must engage in heated combat to
       brew up the "winds of time." The
       Reckoning is at hand!
  88:
  - number: 314
  - string: __Calm After the Storm
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Your heroic efforts successfully
       dispersed the Cloud of Darkness, and
       what you have shed to become a god
       of light has returned to you, meaning
       you are mortal once more. Return to
       Reisenjima, where your allies await.
  89:
  - number: 318
  - string: __Nary a Cloud in Sight
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       The winds of time have cleansed
       every corner of the land, and what
       was once bleak is now bright.
       However, this also means Iroha will
       soon disappear from the world.
       Spend a few final moments with her
       outside.
  90:

  - string: __An Unending Song

      Mission Orders:
       Though Iroha may be gone, peace has
       come to Vana'diel at last. Selh'teus's
       crystal continues to shine, and soon
       the Emptiness will be no more. But
       your adventures will never end so
       long as you continue unceasingly
       forward.
  91:
  - number: 324
  - string: __A Deep Sleep
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       You saw a vision of Iroha being
       overtaken by the Cloud of Darkness.
       Were all your efforts for naught? Is
       another struggle about to commence?
       Make haste for the crystal in
       Reisenjima.
  92:
  - number: 326
  - string: __Guardians
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Fragments of the Cloud of Darkness
       remained in Reisenjima's crystal. The
       future is far from saved, and Iroha
       remains in this time. The avatars' help
       is paramount. Head to the stone circle
       in La Theine Plateau.
  93:
  - number: 328
  - string: __Iroha in Distress
  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Carbuncle and the other avatars have
       lent you their powers. With this, you
       should be able to enter the crystal in
       Reisenjima once more.
  94:

  - string: |-
      Mission Orders:
       Alter egos of your most stalwart
       allies have given their all to stall for
       time in the struggle against the Cloud
       of Darkness. The time is at hand--
       steel yourself and enter the crystal!

      Mission Orders:
       The avatars have succeeded in
       bringing Phoenix--and Iroha--to life
       once more. The time to stop the
       Cloud of Darkness is at hand! Should
       you falter, return to the stone circle
       in La Theine Plateau.
  96:

      Mission Orders:
       Having vanquished the Cloud of
       Darkness, you are certain that the
       future has been set on its proper
       course. Iroha has returned to her
       time, yet this is not the final
       goodbye. Someday, far in the future,
       you will be reunited once more.
