  6763: I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!${prompt}
  6764: |-
    First, the basics, kupo!
    Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to “Mog House” when you're in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt}
  6765: Press it and the “Mog House” menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!${prompt}
  6766: There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...${prompt}
  6767: So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!${prompt}
  6768: Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!${prompt}
  6769: |-
    What do you want to know about?
    ${selection-lines}
    The Mog Safe.
    Storage.
    The Delivery Box.
    Changing jobs.
    Gardening.
    Changing the layout.
    Mog House invitations.
    I got it, thanks, kupo!${prompt}
  6770: The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!${prompt}
  6771: You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!${prompt}
  6772: The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!${prompt}
  6773: You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!${prompt}
  6774: If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!${prompt}
  6775: You can send items and gil to your friends with the “Send” command, kupo!${prompt}
  6776: (Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the "Exclusive" attribute, kupo...!)${prompt}
  6777: Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!${prompt}
  6778: I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!${prompt}
  6779: And...the rest is a secret, kupo!${prompt}
  6780: All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!${prompt}
  6781: As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!${prompt}
  6782: This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...${prompt}
  6783: It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!${prompt}
  6784: If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!${prompt}
  6785: Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the “Layout” command, kupo!${prompt}
  6786: |-
    It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo!
    Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!${prompt}
  6787: You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!${prompt}
  6788: You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!${prompt}
  6789: Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?${prompt}
  6790: |-
    Are you sure?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm sure!
    Maybe I'm not so sure...${prompt}
  6791: And finally, a little bit of advice!${prompt}
  6792: If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!${prompt}
  6793: If you type “/ae Hello!”, then your message will be heard by many people.${prompt}
  6794: If you type “/ae” followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!${prompt}
  6795: Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!${prompt}
  6796: |-
    Okay, kupo!
    Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!${prompt}
  6797: Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?${prompt}
  6798: |-
    Ask about your Mog House again?
    ${selection-lines}
    Don't ask.
    Ask.${prompt}
  6799: |-
    Over the mountains and the rolling hills,
    I'll go wherever my master wills.♪${prompt}
  6800: |-
    Master!
    I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!${prompt}
  6801: But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select “Mog House” from the main menu and check, kupo!${prompt}
  6802: When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!${prompt}
  6803: |-
    Master!
    I have something to tell you, kupo!${prompt}

    It was very hard work, kupo...
    I'm very tired, kupo...${prompt}
  6816: 'I found this behind the ${item-singular: 3[2]} painting, kupo!${prompt}'
  6817: |-
    This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo!
    It's all yours, kupo!${prompt}
  6818: 'Something clattered inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]} when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!${prompt}'
  6819: It's all yours, kupo!${prompt}
  6820: 'I felt there was something strange about the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!${prompt}'

  6822: Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!${prompt}
  6823: |-
    At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you!
    Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!${prompt}
  6824: For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.${prompt}
  6825: 'Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[overwhelming/powerful/faint] ${choice: 1}[fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!${prompt}'
  6826: 'Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!${prompt}'
  6827: Each item of furniture you place using the “Layout” command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!${prompt}
  6828: When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt}

    Traversez le pont au sud-ouest d'ici et allez aux Marchés de Bastok. Une fois là-bas, dirigez-vous vers le sud, et vous serez dans le quartier des Mines. Les Mines de Zeruhn se trouvent dans la section ouest.${prompt}
  7270: |-
    Vous avez tout compris ?
    Si vous vous perdez, demandez simplement aux gens en chemin.${prompt}

  7272: Pourquoi ne commencez-vous pas par aider cette fille qui était là plus tôt ?${prompt}
  7273: |-
    On l'a souvent vue se rendre à l'entrepôt de Tenshodo à l'ouest d'ici.
    J'espère qu'elle ne s'attire pas d'ennuis avec eux.${prompt}
  7274: De l'argent, hein ? Vous devriez essayer le Restaurant du Mouton Fumant, une taverne qui accueille toutes sortes de clients. L'un de leurs habitués pourrait savoir quelque chose d'utile.${prompt}
  7275: |-
    La taverne est un peu à l'ouest d'ici.
    Vous ne pouvez pas la manquer.${prompt}

    Le nom du Chef Ingénieur est Cid. Tout Bastokan le saurait !

  7390: En tant que Bastoker, vous êtes censé accomplir davantage de missions et participer à des conquêtes pour préserver l'avenir radieux de Bastok !${prompt}
  7391: Mais je ne peux pas vous donner de nouvelle mission pour l'instant.${prompt}
  7392: Vous devez accumuler des points de rang avant de pouvoir entreprendre de nouvelles missions.${prompt}
  7393: Vous pouvez obtenir des points de rang en participant aux conquêtes, en faisant don des cristaux que vous récupérez aux gardes, ou en accomplissant des missions que vous avez déjà terminées.${prompt}
  7394: Demandez au Haut Garde près du corps de garde si vous souhaitez en savoir plus sur les conquêtes.${prompt}
  7395: Avez-vous entendu parler d'une étrange structure appelée le Roc de Dem ? Elle se trouve dans les Hautes Terres de Konschtat, au nord des Montagnes de Gustaberg.${prompt}

    Je vois que vous êtes rentré sain et sauf de votre voyage à Windurst et San d'Oria.
    Cette nouvelle mission ne devrait pas être difficile pour un aventurier expérimenté comme vous.${prompt}

  7407: Vous devez aller rencontrer Iron Eater, l'un des Mousquetaires de Mithril, pour recevoir un briefing complet.${prompt}
  7408: Les Mines de Gusgen, dans les Hautes Terres de Konschtat, ont été creusées jusqu'à la roche nue et abandonnées depuis longtemps...${prompt}

    Mais récemment, des rapports indiquent qu'un minerai rare peut y être trouvé.
    Personne n'a encore revendiqué ce nouveau filon.${prompt}

    L'objet que Davyad a rapporté était ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}. C'est ce que vous devez chercher aussi.

    Bon travail, aventurier. Cette découverte pourrait aider à revitaliser l'économie de Bastok !${prompt}
  7413: Vous avez entendu parler de Jeuno, n'est-ce pas ? Le gouvernement de Bastok cherche actuellement quelqu'un à envoyer là-bas, et votre nom figure sur la liste des candidats.${prompt}
  7414: L'aide présidentielle, Sir Lucius lui-même, vous a recommandé. C'est un grand honneur--vous devriez en être fier !${prompt}
  7415: Sir Lucius souhaite vous voir dès que possible. Allez le rencontrer dans son bureau, dans la section administrative, au sommet des Ateliers.${prompt}

    J'ai des ordres pour vous de la part du président lui-même.

    Le président vous informera lui-même dans son bureau.
    Bonne chance, aventurier !${prompt}

    Ah, vous êtes de retour de Jeuno.
    Allez immédiatement au bureau du président.
    Sir Naji vous fera entrer.${prompt}

    Croyez-moi, le travail d'un garde est plutôt ennuyeux.
    Pas que je préfère avoir des ennuis, cela dit.${prompt}

    La porte nord et la place Beligen sont en bas de ces escaliers.
    Traversez le pont-levis depuis la place si vous voulez aller dans le quartier résidentiel.${prompt}

    Allez tout droit vers l'ouest et vous tomberez sur un magasin de marchandises et la taverne.
    Plus à l'ouest se trouve la route menant au quartier des marchés.${prompt}

    Le quartier résidentiel est de l'autre côté de ce pont-levis.

    Celles de droite sont des entrepôts ordinaires.
    On a vu des personnages pas très recommandables y entrer, donc fais attention, d'accord ?${prompt}
  7432: |-
    À gauche, tu as l'agence de voyage aérien, ou "la porte vers le monde", comme on dit.
    Il te faut un pass aérien pour entrer, cependant. Et pas par cette porte non plus -- c'est la sortie. Heh-heh.${prompt}
  7433: L'entrée est juste au coin. Une fois à l'intérieur, tu dois marcher jusqu'au quai pour embarquer sur les aéronefs.${prompt}
  7434: Les aéronefs là-bas vont seulement à Jeuno -- mais bien sûr, tu le savais, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7435: |-
    Un peu plus loin, nous avons le magasin de voyages de Galvin -- un magasin de marchandises.
    Ils ont quelques affaires dont des aventuriers comme vous pourriez avoir besoin.${prompt}
  7436: |-
    Au-dessus de Galvin, vous avez le restaurant Steaming Sheep, que la plupart des gens appellent "la taverne".
    C'est un bon endroit si vous voulez manger, boire ou entendre une bonne histoire ou deux.${prompt}
  7437: |-
    Et plus loin à l'ouest... vous arriverez à un pont.
    Il mène au quartier des marchés, une partie plus agréable de la ville.${prompt}
  7438: Vous pouvez accéder à la fois aux Ateliers et au quartier des Mines depuis les marchés. C'est comme le carrefour de Bastok, si vous voyez ce que je veux dire.${prompt}
  7439: D'accord, à l'est -- nous avons quelques retours à gauche, quelques étals de marchands à droite...${prompt}
  7440: |-
    Oh, ces marchands n'ont pas grand-chose à vendre, au fait.
    Ils ne sont utiles que si vous voulez vendre des choses dont vous n'avez pas besoin et retourner dehors immédiatement.${prompt}
  7441: Exact, plus bas dans les escaliers se trouve... la porte nord !${prompt}
  7442: Vous pouvez obtenir des missions auprès des gardes là-bas ou demander à participer à des conquêtes.${prompt}
  7443: Juste au sud de la place se trouve l'un de nos principaux monuments, le pont-levis !${prompt}
  7444: Il doit être levé lorsque des aéronefs arrivent, donc faites attention. Le quartier résidentiel de l'autre côté est là où se trouve votre chambre. Allez-y si vous devez stocker des affaires.${prompt}
  7445: Oh, mais vous devez être un Bastoker ou avoir une chambre à louer pour faire cela.${prompt}
  7446: C'est à peu près tout. Revenez si vous avez d'autres questions, d'accord ?${prompt}
  7447: Ce bâtiment ici est où vous embarquez sur les aéronefs. Je suis généralement ici toute la journée, donc j'entends beaucoup d'histoires sur ce qui se passe dans d'autres pays.${prompt}
  7448: |-
    Voyager en aéronef est un droit réservé à ceux qui se sont prouvés dignes.
    Il est encore un peu tôt pour vous, je pense.${prompt}
  7449: Je viens de San d'Oria. Y êtes-vous déjà allé ? Vous ne voulez pas. C'est une nation piégée dans de vieilles traditions et des règles absurdes.${prompt}
  7450: L'armée san d'orienne est considérée comme la plus puissante de Vana'diel, mais elle n'est qu'une ombre de ce qu'elle était autrefois.${prompt}
  7451: J'ai choisi de laisser mon âme être ravagée par la cruel rouage du temps plutôt que de passer une éternité dans cette ville intemporelle. Ici, au moins, je me sens vivant.${prompt}
  7452: |-
    Rafaela et moi adorons nous promener le long de ce chemin.
    Le vent de la mer pénètre profondément et apaise l'âme. Vous le ressentez aussi ?${prompt}
  7453: |-
    La mer de Bastok est de la même teinte de bleu que celle près de San d'Oria. Elles ne font qu'une.
    Je ne désire plus mon pays natal... J'ai Rafaela, maintenant.${prompt}
  7454: Parfois, alors que nous regardons la mer ensemble, Evi a ce regard vraiment triste sur son visage...${prompt}
  7455: Et je pense, peut-être qu'il n'était jamais censé être l'un d'entre nous, et qu'il ne devrait pas rester ici à Bastok.${prompt}
  7456: Cherchez-vous quelque chose ? Il n'y a rien ici que vous voudriez.${prompt}
  7457: |-
    Si vous cherchez ma fille Ayame, elle travaille au bureau du président.
    Elle ne rentre pas souvent à la retour.${prompt}
  7458: Tout le monde dit qu'ils sont tous fiers de ma sœur.${prompt}
  7459: |-
    Moi aussi—elle est forte, cool et intelligente.
    Je ne suis aucune de ces choses... Je ne pourrai jamais être comme elle.${prompt}
  7460: Les Humes prévoyaient de construire un nouveau bâtiment ici.${prompt}
  7461: Mais lorsque le chef ingénieur Hume a changé de département, ils ont annulé tout le projet, nous laissant sur le carreau. Je déteste la bureaucratie Hume.${prompt}
  7462: Il n'y a rien à voir ici. Juste un autre projet Hume oublié, où nous, les Galka, avons fait tout le travail et n'avons rien à montrer pour notre sueur et notre labeur.${prompt}
  7463: |-
    C'est une belle journée, n'est-ce pas ?
    Bastok a changé. Il y a ce pont-levis là-bas et des aéronefs dans les airs...
    Mais le soleil brille toujours aussi fort que quand nous étions enfants.${prompt}
  7464: C'était l'endroit secret où les jeunes amoureux se rencontraient. Qiji et moi venions ici aussi, avant de nous installer ensemble.${prompt}
  7465: |-
    Les gens disent que le pont-levis vieillit, mais il me semble aussi solide que la première fois que je l'ai vu.
    Si quelque chose a changé, cela doit être quelque chose en nous...${prompt}
  7466: Je suis heureux que ma petite-fille m'aime, mais je dois dire que j'ai du mal à suivre son rythme à mon âge.${prompt}
  7467: |-
    Allez, Grand-mère !
    Par ici !${prompt}
  7468: |-
    Je ne sais pas ce qui ne va pas avec mon fils. Il reste à la retour toute la journée et ne fait rien.
    J'aimerais pouvoir faire quelque chose.${prompt}
  7469: |-
    Laissez-moi tranquille ! Je ne veux pas sortir !
    Je suis en sécurité ici... personne ne peut me faire de mal...${prompt}
  7470: Il est mieux rémunéré de travailler pour les Humes dans ce quartier que de creuser dans les mines.${prompt}
  7471: Ces bons à rien de têtes dures dans le quartier des mines ne savent pas ce qu'ils ratent.${prompt}
  7472: |-
    Puis-je vous aider ? Non, vous ne pouvez pas entreposer d'objets personnels ici.
    Notre espace est loué à de grandes entreprises commerciales et à des ministères du gouvernement.${prompt}
  7473: |-
    J'ai vu des personnages vraiment louches entrer dans l'entrepôt à côté. Je me demande quel genre de business ils font ?
    En fait, peu importe. Je ne veux pas savoir.${prompt}
  7474: Nous sommes venus ici depuis Windurst en espérant gagner un peu de gil rapidement, mais les affaires sont vraiment très lentes... presque aussi lentes que les remèdes de Panana.${prompt}
  7475: Je n'aime vraiment pas me battre, mais Konty nous emmène tout le temps dans des endroits dangereux !${prompt}
  7476: Pourquoi ai-je jamais accepté de quitter Windurst ? Je veux rentrer chez moi... <soupir>${prompt}
  7477: |-
    Hé, tu es un novice ?
    Si j'étais toi, j'irais chasser des lézards.
    Ils valent le coup, fais-moi confiance.${prompt}
  7478: |-
    Traverse ce pont pour aller au quartier des marchés.
    Prends aussi cette route pour arriver aux usines—qui incluent des forges et des bâtiments administratifs—et au quartier des mines.${prompt}
  7479: Un chevalier Elvaan nommé Domien ?${prompt}
  7480: Oui, je crois que j'ai vu quelqu'un correspondant à cette description passer tout à l'heure... attends, est-ce lui ?${prompt}
  7481: 'Ce ${item-singular: 7[2]}... es-tu Powhatan ?${prompt}'
  7482: |-
    Tu es son représentant ?
    Peu importe—tu devrais savoir que le retard à une réunion est impoli, pour ne pas dire impardonnable, d'où je viens.${prompt}
  7483: |-
    J'ai écrit une lettre de plainte à Monsieur Powhatan.
    Donnez-la lui—je retourne à Jeuno.
    Au revoir.${prompt}
  7484: |-
    Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas avec moi ?
    J'ai trop peur de sortir... je veux me cacher dans un petit endroit étroit...${prompt}
  7485: |-
    J'ai besoin de quelque chose de suffisamment grand pour cacher tout mon corps !
    Avez-vous quelque chose comme ça ? Pouvez-vous en trouver un pour moi ? S'il vous plaît ?${prompt}
  7486: |-
    Oui, oui ! C'est génial !
    Enfin, je peux dormir en paix !
    Je ne sortirai plus jamais ! Hah hah !${prompt}
  7487: |-
    Ah, c'est toi !
    Cette coquille que tu m'as donnée est géniale !
    J'ai dû être une tortue dans une vie antérieure !${prompt}
  7488: Toi ! C'est toi qui as donné cette chose maudite à mon fils, n'est-ce pas !?${prompt}
  7489: À cause de toi, non seulement il ne sort jamais, mais il reste dans cette coquille toute la journée !${prompt}
  7490: Fais quelque chose ! N'y a-t-il rien que tu puisses faire pour le faire sortir de sa coquille ?${prompt}
  7491: |-
    C'est de ta faute, Panana ! Je savais que je n'aurais pas dû te laisser me convaincre d'aller à Beadeaux !
    Maintenant, j'ai ces bestioles qui me démangent partout !${prompt}
  7492: |-
    Ce n'est pas de ma faute !
    Je t'ai bien prévenu de ne pas chercher des trésors-plaisirs à l'intérieur des coquilles de Quadav !${prompt}
  7493: |-
    Tout le monde sait qu'elles sont pleines de ${item-plural: 7[2]} !
    Il faut faire attention quand on les touche !${prompt}
  7494: |-
    Tu ne connais pas le dicton : “mettre des ${item-plural: 7[2]} dans une coquille de Quadav” ?
    Ça veut dire “attirer des ennuis !”${prompt}
  7495: |-
    Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
    Ah, bien sûr ! “Mettre des ${item-plural: 7[2]} dans une coquille de Quadav !”
    Tout ce que j'ai à faire, c'est de mettre cette petite chose désagréable dans la coquille de mon fils, c'est ça ?${prompt}
  7496: |-
    Je vais le faire tout de suite !
    Reviens plus tard--je te donnerai une récompense si ça marche !${prompt}
  7497: Ma coquille a soudainement commencé à me démanger...${prompt}
  7498: Maintenant, je me demande pourquoi je voulais me cacher là-dedans en premier lieu...${prompt}
  7499: |-
    Oh, te voilà !
    Ton astuce a fonctionné !
    Maintenant, si seulement mon fils voulait sortir...
    Quoi qu'il en soit, voici quelque chose pour te remercier de ton aide.${prompt}
  7500: Je te le dis, c'est ces Quadav. Ils ont dû lui lancer une sorte de malédiction !${prompt}
  7501: La fille de mon voisin Ensetsu, Ayame, est une fille vraiment remarquable. Tu l'as déjà rencontrée ?${prompt}
  7502: Elle a toujours été très brillante. Elle est devenue samouraï quand elle était petite, et maintenant, elle est arrivée au sommet et est devenue une Mousquetaire de Mythril !${prompt}
  7503: Seuls les cinq meilleurs Mousquetaires peuvent rejoindre leurs rangs, tu sais. Ensetsu doit être fier qu'Ayame ait été choisie pour en faire partie !${prompt}
  7504: |-
    Maintenant, si seulement sa sœur Kaede était un peu plus comme elle.
    Elle est si discrète et quelconque...mais je suppose que les enfants doivent être vus et non entendus.${prompt}
  7505: |-
    Je ne vois jamais beaucoup Corann... Oh, c'est le fils de mon voisin Ronan.
    Je pense qu'il reste enfermé dans sa chambre toute la journée.${prompt}
  7506: Il est comme une tortue dans sa coquille... Tellement que certaines personnes disent même que les hommes-tortues lui ont jeté une malédiction à sa naissance !${prompt}
  7507: |-
    La taverne est en haut de ces marches.
    Le magasin de biens et le pont menant au quartier des marchés se trouvent droit à l'ouest.${prompt}
  7508: |-
    À l'est se trouve la Porte Nord et le pont-levis menant à la zone résidentielle.
    C'est à peu près tout.${prompt}
  7509: J'ai commencé à travailler pour l'agence de voyages aériens en espérant devenir un jour pilote d'aéronef, mais tout ce qu'ils me font faire, c'est déplacer des boîtes et des caisses.${prompt}
  7510: |-
    J'aurais peut-être dû aller à Jeuno à la place.
    Jeuno est l'endroit où vont tous les aéronefs, tu sais ?
    Comme le dit le dicton, “Tous les chemins mènent à Jeuno” ou quelque chose comme ça.${prompt}
  7511: En raison de problèmes techniques, nous ne pouvons pas délivrer de Passes-Monde pour le moment.${prompt}
  7512: |-
    C'est ici que nous délivrons les Passes-Monde.
    Un Pass-Monde vous permet d'inviter des personnes d'autres mondes à vous rejoindre.${prompt}
  7513: 'Votre Pass-Monde est : “${entity: 0}.”${prompt}'
  7514: Sachez que vous ne pouvez inviter qu'un nombre limité de personnes à ce monde avec votre Pass-Monde.${prompt}
  7515: Cet endroit est tellement bien situé... J'aimerais que les Humes n'aient pas abandonné tout le projet.${prompt}
  7516: |-
    Tu aurais dû nous voir quand le contremaître était encore là !
    Nous étions occupés comme des abeilles, mais heureux comme des agneaux de participer à ce grand projet.
    Mais regarde-nous maintenant.${prompt}
  7517: |-
    Le contremaître l'a pris le plus mal. Il a disparu quand le projet a été annulé.
    Je crois que son chien est parti avec lui aussi.${prompt}
  7518: |-
    Je me demande ce qui lui est arrivé ?
    Il est encore un peu trop tôt pour qu'il soit parti pour son voyage de renaissance...${prompt}
  7519: |-
    Dis, tu es un aventurier, n'est-ce pas ?
    Peux-tu me dire si tu entends quoi que ce soit à propos de notre contremaître ou de son chien ?${prompt}
  7520: Le contremaître m'a dit de ne le dire à personne, mais il a dit qu'il allait sur la grande colline de North Gustaberg.${prompt}
  7521: Il m'a dit qu'il serait absent pendant un certain temps, alors il m'a demandé de m'occuper de son chien pendant son absence.${prompt}
  7522: |-
    Mais le jour après le départ du contremaître, son chien a aussi disparu.
    J'espère qu'ils vont bien tous les deux...${prompt}
  7523: |-
    Hé... le chien du contremaître avait l'habitude de porter ce collier.
    Que ferait un chien mort-vivant--dans North Gustaberg, de toutes les régions--avec ça ?${prompt}
  7524: Certains disent que lorsque tu meurs, le regret que tu as pour les choses que tu as laissées inachevées pourrait te transformer en mort-vivant, mais... est-ce possible ?${prompt}
  7525: Si c'était le chien du contremaître que tu as combattu, alors cela signifierait que le contremaître est aussi...${prompt}
  7526: |-
    Non, il ne peut pas l'être.
    Il doit déjà s'être réincarné dans un nouveau corps. Il disait souvent que ce projet pourrait être son dernier travail...${prompt}
  7527: Je souhaite juste que nous aurions pu le terminer, pour le bien du contremaître.${prompt}
  7528: |-
    Quoi qu'il en soit, je devrais te remercier pour cette nouvelle, qu'elle soit bonne ou mauvaise.
    Tiens, prends ça. Ce n'est pas grand-chose, mais ça devrait te servir.${prompt}
  7529: |-
    La chasse aux timbres, n'est-ce pas ?
    Oui, tu n'es pas le premier aventurier à venir me demander ça.
    Tiens.${prompt}
  7530: Tu as reçu un timbre !${prompt}
  7531: |-
    Chasser quoi ? Oh, des timbres.
    D'accord, je suis censé les distribuer aussi.
    Tiens.${prompt}
  7532: |-
    Je ne sais pas ce que je suis censé rechercher ici.
    Bien sûr, il y a ces Galka grognons sur le site de construction et des affaires louches dans les entrepôts, mais ce ne sont rien de nouveau.${prompt}
  7533: |-
    J'ai besoin d'une faveur.
    Je veux offrir un cadeau à ma femme Romilda ici.${prompt}
  7534: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} serait parfait...pourrais-tu m’en chercher un ?${prompt}'
  7535: |-
    Oh ! Le ${item-singular: 7[2]} !
    Mais j'ai un peu trop honte de le lui donner moi-même...pourrais-tu le faire pour moi ?${prompt}
  7536: |-
    Mon ! ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}, pour moi ?
    Pourquoi, c'est très gentil de ta part !${prompt}
  7537: |-
    Qiji, regarde ce que cette personne sympathique m'a donné !
    Et tu ne m'as pas offert de cadeau depuis longtemps !
    Honte à toi !${prompt}
  7538: M-mais, c'est--${prompt}
  7539: |-
    Merci beaucoup !
    J'en ai voulu un de ces trucs depuis longtemps.
    C'est comme si tu lisais dans mes pensées !${prompt}
  7540: Euh...${prompt}
  7541: |-
    Eh bien, tant qu'elle est heureuse, je ne peux pas me plaindre.
    Voici quelque chose pour ta peine.${prompt}
  7542: |-
    Oui ? Bien sûr que je sais que ce cadeau vient de mon mari, chérie.
    Il pense que j'ai du mal à entendre, mais c'est lui qui n'entend même pas ce qu'il dit !${prompt}
  7543: |-
    En fait, ce n'est pas la première fois qu'il fait ça.
    Mais tu sais quoi ? C'est une chose merveilleuse de recevoir un cadeau de quelqu'un qui t'aime, peu importe combien de fois, ou quel âge tu as.${prompt}
  7544: |-
    Je devrais aussi donner quelque chose à Qiji en retour pour son cadeau cette fois-ci.
    Serais-tu assez aimable pour aller me chercher ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}, chérie ?${prompt}
  7545: |-
    Oh, et ne t'inquiète pas, je peux les lui donner moi-même.
    Les hommes sont si lâches !${prompt}
  7546: |-
    Ah, tu les as apportés.
    Merci.
    Voici quelque chose pour toi.${prompt}
  7547: |-
    Hmm ? Toi ! Que lui donnes-tu ?
    Est-ce un cadeau d'un autre homme ?!${prompt}
  7548: |-
    Oh, ne sois pas ridicule, Qiji.
    Cette personne sympathique m'a juste apporté ce que j'ai demandé--un cadeau de moi pour toi.
    Tiens.${prompt}
  7549: |-
    Un cadeau ? Oh ! ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} !
    Bien sûr que tu le ferais ! Tu n'as jamais pu résister à mon charme ! <Clin d'œil>
    Heh-heh.${prompt}
  7550: |-
    Oui, oui...
    Ah, tiens, prends ça.
    Merci encore.${prompt}
  7551: |-
    Oh, et... une chose de plus.
    Voir ou entendre les choses de la même manière n'est pas important. Partager les mêmes moments de ta vie l'est.${prompt}
  7552: |-
    Qiji m'a dit ça quand il m'a demandé en mariage.
    J'aime à penser que c'est pour ça que nous sommes toujours ensemble.${prompt}
  7553: |-
    Je dois te demander de faire quelque chose pour moi.
    Tu vois, j'étais autrefois un chevalier de San d'Oria. J'ai quitté l'Ordre et suis venu ici, à Bastok, quand j'ai réalisé la futilité de leurs méthodes.${prompt}
  7554: |-
    En venant ici, j'ai enterré mes ordres de mission du jour près des moulins à vent à Konschtat.
    C'était une chose déshonorante à faire, et je le regrette maintenant...${prompt}
  7555: Evi ? Tu ne vas pas revenir, si ?${prompt}
  7556: |-
    Ne t'inquiète pas, Rafaela, je ne le ferai pas.
    Ce papier est un témoignage de mes échecs passés...
    Je souhaite juste le déchirer de mes propres mains, et enfin recommencer à zéro.${prompt}
  7557: |-
    Si tu vas aux Highlands de Konschtat, pourrais-tu essayer de le récupérer pour moi ?
    Malheureusement, je ne me souviens pas près de quel moulin à vent je l'ai enterré...${prompt}
  7558: |-
    Oui, c'est ça. Enfin, je peux recommencer à zéro.
    Prends ceci comme un signe de ma gratitude.
    Je n'en ai plus besoin.${prompt}
  7559: Ah, j'aimerais avoir le temps de discuter, mais je suis un peu occupée en ce moment.${prompt}
  7560: Je suis la propriétaire de cet établissement, mais je n'ai pas encore eu le temps de m'habituer à faire toutes ces tâches...${prompt}
  7561: |-
    Oui ? Y a-t-il quelque chose que tu peux faire pour aider ?
    Eh bien, nous manquons un peu de sel, et j'ai des problèmes avec la comptabilité, et...${prompt}
  7562: Oh, ça ne sert à rien. J'essaie de gérer ce restaurant depuis que mon mari est décédé il y a vingt ans, mais je n'arrive toujours à rien faire correctement...${prompt}
  7563: 'L’autre jour, un client a commandé ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}, mais je n’ai pas pu en obtenir.${prompt}'
  7564: C'était un client régulier quand mon mari tenait cet endroit, donc j'aimerais pouvoir le servir la prochaine fois qu'il viendra.${prompt}
  7565: |-
    N'est-ce pas...? Oui, c'est ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} ! Merci beaucoup !
    Oh ! Je devrais te payer pour ton aide...${prompt}
  7566: |-
    On t'a demandé de m'aider ? Mais qui pourrait... ?
    Le Chef Ingénieur lui-même ?${prompt}
  7567: |-
    Je vois...
    Montons à l'étage--il y a quelques choses que je devrais te dire.${prompt}
  7568: Le Chef Cid était un ami proche de mon mari. C'est lui qui a donné à mon mari son emploi dans les Mines de Palborough. Creuser du mythril là-bas lui a permis de gagner assez de gil pour ouvrir ce restaurant.${prompt}
  7569: Puis, il y a vingt ans, ils ont découvert une nouvelle veine de mythril dans les Mines de Palborough, et mon mari, bien qu'il soit déjà à la retraite, a été appelé à superviser les fouilles.${prompt}
  7570: Les choses se passaient bien jusqu'à ce qu'un lot du nouveau type d'explosifs qu'ils utilisaient explose sans avertir, et comme si cela attendait une telle occasion, les Quadav ont attaqué.${prompt}
  7571: Tu dois l'avoir deviné maintenant--le Chef Ingénieur Cid était celui qui a conçu la formule de la nouvelle explosive.${prompt}
  7572: Je mentirais si je disais que je n'ai jamais blâmé Cid pour la mort de mon mari... même si mon mari l'aurait sûrement pardonné.${prompt}
  7573: |-
    Donne cette lettre à Cid pour moi.
    Dis-lui qu'il n'a pas à s'inquiéter pour moi, ni pour ce restaurant.${prompt}
  7574: |-
    Ah, c'est toi.
    Ce client dont je t'ai parlé est revenu, et j'ai pu lui servir ${item-singular: 6[2]} cette fois, grâce à toi.${prompt}
  7575: Il a dit qu'il travaillait avec mon mari dans la Métallurgie avant de prendre sa retraite.${prompt}
  7576: 'Il voulait avoir ${item-singular: 7[2]} la prochaine fois qu’il vient, mais je ne sais pas où en trouver un...${prompt}'
  7577: |-
    Oh, mon ! Où as-tu trouvé ça ? Merci, tu m'as encore sauvé !
    Je dois dire à ce client de revenir...${prompt}
  7578: |-
    Oh, mais j'ai oublié de lui demander son nom !
    Il a dit qu'il travaillait encore dans la Métallurgie...${prompt}
  7579: |-
    Il a dit qu'il travaillait autrefois avec mon mari là-bas.
    C'est un Galka, très réservé mais poli.
    Le connais-tu ?${prompt}
  7580: Si tu le vois, pourrais-tu lui donner cette lettre d'invitation pour moi ?${prompt}
  7581: |-
    As-tu donné ma lettre à mon client ?
    Tu l'as fait ? Merci.
    Tu dis que son nom est Raibaht ?${prompt}
  7582: |-
    Il travaille dans le laboratoire de Cid comme assistant du Chef Ingénieur ?
    Maintenant que tu le mentionnes, je me souviens d'avoir entendu son nom auparavant...${prompt}
  7583: Oh !${prompt}
  7584: |-
    Merci pour votre invitation, Mme Hilda.
    Je dois m'excuser pour mon manque de politesse en commandant des plats sans même laisser mon nom.${prompt}
  7585: S'il te plaît, Monsieur Raibaht, par ici.${prompt}
  7586: |-
    Mon mari et moi avons été embauchés la même année par le Département de Métallurgie de l'Exploitation Minère.
    Mais nous n'avons jamais été en bons termes, pour dire le moins.${prompt}
  7587: Alors pourquoi...?${prompt}
  7588: La plupart des Humes ne pensent qu'à nous comme de grands brutes... mais ton mari était le seul à me voir, en tant que Galka, comme quelqu'un de suffisamment digne pour être son rival.${prompt}
  7589: |-
    Les autres Humes ne me considéraient même pas capable d'être un scientifique.
    Ton mari, en revanche, venait me voir chaque fois qu'il faisait une avancée... et se vantait.${prompt}
  7590: Tu peux rire, mais je ne peux pas expliquer à quel point j'étais heureux qu'il vienne me voir, et personne d'autre.${prompt}
  7591: |-
    Oui, mon mari était comme ça.
    Il était franc, honnête sur ses sentiments, même enfantin à certains égards.
    Son désir d'ouvrir ce restaurant, par exemple...${prompt}
  7592: Oui. J'étais déconcertée au début quand il a décidé de prendre sa retraite, mais après avoir vu cet endroit... je comprends pourquoi.${prompt}
  7593: |-
    Quand as-tu décidé de travailler pour le Chef Ingénieur ?
    Je ne pensais pas que ce genre de travail faisait partie de ton domaine d'expertise.${prompt}
  7594: |-
    Ton mari me parlait souvent de lui.
    Quand j'ai appris que c'était son invention qui avait causé la mort de ton mari, j'ai décidé de l'approcher, sans révéler mes véritables intentions.${prompt}
  7595: Qu'est-ce que tu pensais faire ?!${prompt}
  7596: Je voulais voir quel genre d'homme pouvait vivre avec la mort de tant de personnes sur la conscience... mais je n'ai pas encore réussi à le comprendre complètement. Il est plus complexe que n'importe quelle équation que j'ai dû résoudre.${prompt}
  7597: |-
    Mais ne t'inquiète pas, madame--la vengeance a depuis longtemps disparu de mon esprit.
    Je comprends maintenant pourquoi ton mari tenait tant à lui.
    Lui et Cid sont très similaires.${prompt}
  7598: Oui... je sais.${prompt}
  7599: J'étudierai le travail de Cid, et quand je le comprendrais complètement, je transmettrai cette connaissance aux générations futures.${prompt}
  7600: |-

    Yes...but not the Cornelia you know. That's why I came here.
    I would like you to tell me about her.${prompt}
  7812: |-
    Then you're wasting your time.
    I have nothing to say regarding Cornelia, a good-for-nothing student who packed up and left Bastok without even informing her master...${prompt}
  7813: |-
    I knew it!
    You were Cornelia's instructor!${prompt}
  7814: Oh, quiet down. Just because you have the same name doesn't mean you have to go romping around, acting as feisty as she was.${prompt}

    So, missy, what's with your interest in the other Cornelia?
    Or, is it that you want to become one of my students?${prompt}
  7816: It's not that...${prompt}
  7817: |-
    Alright, I'll tell you one thing.
    When Cornelia said she wanted to become my pupil, I gave her this test--${prompt}
  7818: 'I told her to go deep into the Gusgen Mines and look for a tiny hole. Using ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} will call forth the vicious Wandering Ghost.${prompt}'
  7819: 'Bring back the ${item-singular: 7[2]} that the beast leaves behind--that was the test I gave her.${prompt}'

  7822: "...? \nThat can't be ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}!\nThere is no way you could have...${prompt}"
  7823: What!? You say you got this after defeating a wandering ghost!?${prompt}
  7824: |-
    No... She could have lost her life in those mines...
    If she had been killed...${prompt}
  7825: The truth is, the test I gave Cornelia and you was just a joke. I never meant for anyone to actually go down there and battle any creatures.${prompt}
  7826: |-
    Think about it.
    I gave that quest to Cornelia over thirty years ago. Mining in Palborough had begun to take off, but the Gusgen Mines...${prompt}
  7827: The Gusgen Mines were still filled with hundreds of workers.${prompt}
  7828: |-
    You senile old man! I can't believe you made me do that!
    There are no ghosts in the Gusgen Mines!${prompt}
  7829: |-
    Oh! I never thought you'd actually go down into the mines!
    But what I told you was no lie.${prompt}
  7830: You're right it wasn't a lie. I met some Galka down there named “Wandering Ghost.” Was that supposed to be funny or something!?${prompt}
  7831: I never said that Wandering Ghost was an actual ghost, did I?${prompt}
  7832: |-
    Whatever!
    Here's the ${item-singular: 7[2]} you asked for, old man.${prompt}
  7833: 'What...? How were you--a simple Hume girl--able to get this ${item-singular: 7[2]} from a hard-headed Galka like Wandering Ghost...${prompt}'
  7834: Tell me about it! I would rather have taken my chances with a real wandering ghost than with that Galka! He wouldn't give me what you asked for until I brought him a hundred chunks of ore.${prompt}
  7835: I spent the last three days and three nights trapped up in that miserable mine so I could pass your test--which turns out to be a big joke. Now it's time for you to hold up your end of the bargain!${prompt}
  7836: I still can't believe that you would...${prompt}
  7837: Enough! I need... I need to be stronger.${prompt}

    I remember you. You're that young adventurer who came by before.
    You always bring someone along with you, don't you?${prompt}
  7842: |-
    Greetings, Master Oggbi. I see you have returned to Bastok.
    My name is Michea. Do you recall our previous meeting?${prompt}
  7843: |-
    Yes, I remember.
    You're the little girl who was always hiding behind Dalzakk. You've grown...${prompt}
  7844: I would like to inquire about Dalzakk.${prompt}
  7845: Is something wrong? Knowing him, he's probably off on some adventure again.${prompt}
  7846: |-
    That's just it. He has not returned from his latest journey...
    Gwill is worried as well, although he will not show it.${prompt}
  7847: Hmm... I remember him saying that he needed to travel to Fei'Yin on business.${prompt}
  7848: Fei'Yin? What business would he have there...?${prompt}
  7849: Well, I'm sorry to trouble you again, young adventurer, but could I ask you a favor?${prompt}
  7850: Recently I asked Dalzakk to run an errand for me. If he's still in Fei'Yin, could you find him and ask him to pass that errand on to you?${prompt}
  7851: I'm sure that Dalzakk could do it himself, but I think he should get back here as soon as possible...for Michea and Gwill's sake.${prompt}
  7852: I apologize for asking you to do so much, but if it is not a burden...${prompt}
  7853: |-
    You may think it strange coming from an old Galka like me, but it hurts me to see Michea this upset.
    Being the daughter of one of my pupils, I've always thought of her as my own granddaughter.${prompt}
  7854: |-
    Ah. So you've gone to Davoi in Dalzakk's stead, then.
    What? Why all the trouble over a simple item such as this, you ask?${prompt}
  7855: Do not worry too much of it. What is most important is that you have helped bring a little piece of happiness to a young Elvaan girl and a Galka boy.${prompt}
  7856: |-
    It looks as if you have some free time. Will you sit down and have a drink with an old man?
    No, no. I won't ask you to go off on some adventure this time, but I'll reward you for just listening to my story.${prompt}
  7857: 'It all has to do with ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}...${prompt}'
  7858: One day, long ago, my pupil Cornelia and I journeyed to San d'Oria together. We were hired by the San d'Orian abbey located in Davoi.${prompt}
  7859: The Temple Knights have long been known for their skill with various weapons. However, the priests of San d'Oria, bound by their religious beliefs, spent their time refining their hand-to-hand fighting skills. One place this was practiced was in the abbey in Davoi.${prompt}
  7860: In any event, a few scrolls containing some of the abbey's knowledge of martial arts were stolen by a band of Orcs in the Jugner Forest. Our job was to get those scrolls back.${prompt}
  7861: The main reason I accepted this job was so I myself could learn of the hidden secrets of the San d'Orian monks. Nowadays, there are many who go around calling themselves monks, but few know that the currently practiced art combines Far Eastern tradition with San d'Orian techniques.${prompt}
  7862: Now, where was I... Oh yes. We headed to the Orc stronghold, or should I say, the stronghold before Davoi was taken.${prompt}
  7863: Master, are you sure we're looking in the right place?${prompt}
  7864: |-
    We're having no luck, are we?
    If this keeps on, we'll be mistaken as burgla--${prompt}
  7865: Sir...Sir Raogrimm?${prompt}
  7866: Master Oggbi. What business have you here at the Orcs' stronghold?${prompt}
  7867: We...we are just looking for...${prompt}
  7868: Hey, you can't talk to my master like that! You make him sound like a common thief!${prompt}
  7869: Oh, I see... You're that Talekeeper, Raogrimm. What's an admirable Musketeer like you doing in a dump like this?${prompt}
  7870: |-
    An amusing pupil you have, Master Oggbi.
    Normally, a Hume girl would not even know the word “Talekeeper.”${prompt}
  7871: Yeah, well, I know what I know.${prompt}
  7872: Enough, Cornelia.${prompt}
  7873: Little did he know they would soon meet again, as members of the Mythril Musketeers...${prompt}
  7874: Oh, I apologize. I've been rambling on again. Here, take this. It is the same reward I gave Cornelia when she completed her quest.${prompt}

  8043: Chaque région comprend plusieurs zones, et la nation qui élimine le plus de monstres dans ces zones gagne le contrôle de la région.${prompt}
  8044: Les nations reçoivent des biens et des ressources des régions sous leur contrôle.${prompt}
  8045: Ainsi, plus nous contrôlons de régions, plus notre nation devient riche.${prompt}

    Des gardes-frontières sont également placés dans des avant-postes au sein des régions sous notre contrôle.

  8047: Une fois que vous avez le Signet de votre nation, vous pourrez acquérir des cristaux auprès des ennemis que vous vaincrez.${prompt}
  8048: Non seulement cela, mais vous recevrez également des points de conquête. Vous obtenez plus de points de conquête si vous vainquez des ennemis dans des régions qui ne sont pas sous le contrôle de votre nation.

  8058: Vous pouvez acheter des objets auprès de gardes comme moi avec vos points de conquête, mais attention, le nombre de points que vous dépensez sera soustrait de votre total actuel.${prompt}
  8059: Lorsque les résultats de la conquête sont annoncés, on vous dira quel pays contrôle la région dans laquelle vous vous trouvez à ce moment-là. Parfois, les régions peuvent devenir neutres, ou les hommes-bêtes peuvent même prendre le contrôle de certaines régions.${prompt}
  8060: Si nous prenons le contrôle d'une région, des gardes frontières seront placés dans ses postes avancés pour aider les aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
  8061: Des marchands seront également placés là-bas, et les marchandises de cette région trouveront leur chemin vers les magasins locaux ici.${prompt}
  8062: Prendre le contrôle des régions est le principe de base derrière les conquêtes. Nous avons besoin de chacun d'entre vous pour donner le meilleur de soi-même et porter notre nation au sommet du classement.${prompt}
  8063: Bien sûr, parfois nous perdons des régions au profit d'autres nations... donc nous devons essayer de les reprendre avant que les prochains résultats de conquête ne soient annoncés.${prompt}
  8064: En guise d'incitation, nous vous récompenserons avec plus de points de conquête pour avoir vaincu des monstres dans ces régions.${prompt}
  8065: Mais si nous sommes alliés avec une autre nation, vous ne recevrez que le taux régulier pour avoir vaincu des monstres dans les régions de nos alliés. En revanche, nous vous attribuerons plus de points pour combattre dans les régions de la nation la mieux classée.${prompt}
  8066: |-
    Notre préoccupation principale réside dans le fait que les hommes-bêtes prennent le contrôle de nos régions.
    Si trop d'entre nous sont vaincus dans une région, les hommes-bêtes en prendront le contrôle.${prompt}
  8067: Si cela se produit, non seulement c'est un grand coup à notre fierté, mais vous ne pourrez pas acquérir de cristaux dans cette région.${prompt}
  8068: Les hommes-bêtes sont une menace pour toutes les nations. S'ils prennent le pouvoir, nous devons tous nous unir et chasser ces créatures viles de cette région.${prompt}
  8069: Nous avons besoin de vous pour apporter des fournitures aux gardes frontaliers des postes avancés placés dans les régions sous notre contrôle.${prompt}
  8070: Il y a un poste avancé dans chaque région. Sélectionnez "Infos sur la région" dans le menu et recherchez les zones marquées par un petit drapeau sur la carte. C'est là où ils se trouvent.${prompt}

  8413: Arrêtez de me traiter comme une enfant ! Vous n'étiez jamais comme ça avec Ayame ! Je sais que je peux apprendre à utiliser un katana et être cool, comme elle !${prompt}
  8414: Kaede...${prompt}
  8415: Père, vous achetez votre katana à M. Kagetora, n'est-ce pas ? Vous pouvez en utiliser un, non ?${prompt}
  8416: Ayame dit qu'elle est partie en voyage pour apprendre les voies de la lame, mais je parie que c'est vous qui l'avez enseignée !${prompt}
  8417: De quoi parles-tu... ?${prompt}
  8418: Je vous déteste ! Pourquoi ne me dites-vous pas la vérité ?!${prompt}
  8419: Je suis désolé que vous ayez dû voir ça... Les filles de nos jours grandissent si vite. Qu'est-ce qu'un père peut faire ?${prompt}
  8420: Un jour, je sais que je devrai lui dire la vérité à propos de...${prompt}
  8421: Excusez-moi. Je sais que vous devez être occupé, mais pourrais-je vous demander une faveur ?${prompt}
  8422: J'aimerais racheter quelque chose que j'ai récemment vendu par l'intermédiaire du Tenshodo. Cependant, Kagetora m'a dit que cela avait déjà été expédié à Norg.${prompt}
  8423: 'Il m''a dit que si je lui apportais ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} du Tunnel de Korroloka, il me rendrait mon objet.${prompt}'
  8424: Cependant, il n'y a aucune chance que je survive à un voyage dans ce tunnel... Je serais en dette avec vous si vous pouviez y aller à ma place.${prompt}
  8425: '${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 7[2]} ! Je suis reconnaissant pour votre aide... mais il y a un problème.${prompt}'
  8426: Kagetora m'a dit que si je voulais récupérer mon objet, je devrais aller à Norg et le chercher moi-même.${prompt}
  8427: Autant j'aimerais y aller, autant je ne peux pas.${prompt}
  8428: 'Je déteste devoir vous demander à nouveau après tout le mal que vous vous êtes donné, mais serait-ce trop demander que vous emmeniez ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} à Ryoma à Norg ? Je serais en dette avec vous...${prompt}'
  8429: J'apprécie tout ce que vous avez fait pour moi et m'excuse de vous avoir fait voyager à Norg à ma place.${prompt}
  8430: L'objet qu'Ensetsu a vendu ici ? Ouais, c'est déjà en route pour Norg. Une fois que j'aurai pris ma part, je n'ai aucune raison d'aider qui que ce soit.${prompt}
  8431: Je ne peux exprimer en mots la gratitude que je ressens pour votre gentillesse. J'ai vendu ceci pour aider à soutenir ma famille, mais ensuite j'ai réalisé que ma fille en avait à nouveau besoin.${prompt}
  8432: |-
    Père !
    Qu'est-ce que c'est ? Vous avez acheté une autre épée pour Ayame, n'est-ce pas ? Ce n'est pas juste !${prompt}
  8433: Arrête de parler de ça ! Je n'ai jamais acheté d'arme pour ta sœur. Chaque katana qu'elle possède a été acquis sans mon aide, ni celle de quiconque d'autre.${prompt}
  8434: Alors, à quoi ça sert ?${prompt}
  8435: J'allais attendre, mais je suppose que tu es assez grande pour savoir...${prompt}
  8436: Ce poignard appartenait à ta mère...${prompt}
  8437: Tu veux dire que ce vieux truc était...${prompt}
  8438: À maman... ?${prompt}
  8439: Oui. Son vrai nom est un shinobi gatana.${prompt}
  8440: Maman était une ninja ?${prompt}
  8441: Il y a longtemps, Yomi... ta mère et moi vivions à Norg. Norg est un havre pour les arts de l'Extrême-Orient.${prompt}
  8442: Je n'étais qu'un simple membre d'équipage sur un navire pirate. Ta mère, en revanche, était une maîtresse du ninjutsu - presque aussi forte qu'elle était belle...${prompt}
  8443: Et c'est probablement pourquoi elle a trouvé du réconfort auprès d'un homme normal et ennuyeux comme moi.${prompt}
  8444: Quand nous avons découvert que ta mère attendait ta sœur, nous avons quitté Norg pour chercher une vie plus simple ici.${prompt}
  8445: 'C''est à ce moment-là que ta mère m''a dit ceci : elle était fière de la voie qu''elle avait empruntée, et c''est cette voie qui l''avait menée à sa nouvelle vie.${prompt}'
  8446: Les difficultés qu'elle a dû surmonter l'ont rendue la mère forte qu'elle était.${prompt}
  8447: Peut-être à ce moment-là, elle a réalisé qu'il ne lui restait pas beaucoup de temps dans ce monde...${prompt}
  8448: Mais elle a lutté pendant dix longues années jusqu'à ce qu'elle échange sa vie contre celle de notre deuxième fille... toi, Kaede.${prompt}
  8449: M-mais...${prompt}
  8450: Je n'ai jamais voulu que toi ou ta sœur preniez le katana.${prompt}
  8451: Quand ta sœur a dit qu'elle voulait voyager à Norg pour étudier l'art du samouraï, bien sûr, j'étais contre. Cependant, si c'était pour l'empêcher de devenir ninja...${prompt}
  8452: Kaede... Chaque jour, tu me rappelles de plus en plus ta mère.${prompt}
  8453: Je te rappelle... maman ?${prompt}
  8454: Et c'est pour ça que j'ai été si protecteur envers toi. Mais peut-être que j'avais tort...${prompt}
  8455: Contrairement à la plupart des combattants, les ninjas ne se contentent pas d'agiter leurs épées. Ils se cachent dans l'ombre et traquent leurs ennemis. Il faut le plus haut niveau de patience et de concentration pour dégainer cette lame.${prompt}
  8456: Ta mère a laissé cette lame gainée pour se rappeler cela, et maintenant cette lame te sera transmise.${prompt}
  8457: Le chemin que tu emprunteras est à toi de décider, mais n'oublie pas le message qui reste dans le katana de ta mère.${prompt}
  8458: Maman !${prompt}
  8459: Je vous remercie tellement pour votre aide à ramener la lame à la maison. Je n'ai pas grand-chose à vous offrir, mais prenez ce parchemin détaillant les secrets des ninjas en guise de remerciement. C'était à ma femme.${prompt}
  8460: Non, Kaede n'en aura pas besoin. Tout ce dont elle avait vraiment besoin, c'était de la volonté et de l'esprit forts de sa mère. Si elle souhaite suivre le chemin choisi par Yomi, ce sera sa décision.${prompt}
  8461: Mais j'ai le sentiment qu'elle ira bientôt à Norg... pour trouver ce chemin.${prompt}
  8462: Vous pouvez maintenant devenir ninja.${prompt}
  8463: Ah, ${name-player}. Merci encore pour tout ce que vous avez fait pour ma fille et moi.${prompt}
  8464: Je vais bien prendre soin du katana de ma mère. Moi aussi, j'apprendrai à être forte comme elle.${prompt}
  8465: Je me souviens que ma sœur parlait de comment les guerriers les plus forts sont ceux qui dégainent leurs lames le moins souvent. Je pense comprendre ce qu'elle voulait dire maintenant...${prompt}
  8466: Un Monsieur Hani ? Maintenant que vous en parlez, je me souviens d'un aventurier portant ce nom... Il parlait d'une lettre qu'il avait reçue d'un Galka.${prompt} 
  8467: Cependant, il semblait plus intéressé par sa prochaine quête que par cette lettre. Il continuait à demander si je savais quelque chose sur les Mines de Palborough.${prompt}
  8468: Mon défunt mari connaissait bien ces mines. Quand je lui ai raconté les histoires que mon mari m'avait racontées, l'aventurier s'est enthousiasmé et a dit qu'il partait pour les Mines le lendemain.${prompt}
  8469: Et c'était la dernière fois que j'en ai entendu parler. J'espère qu'il ne lui est rien arrivé de terrible...${prompt}
  8470: Qu'est-ce que vous voulez dire, Ryoma vous a envoyé ? Il veut savoir à propos de ce vieux parchemin que nous avons trouvé il y a presque vingt ans ?${prompt}
  8471: Pourquoi moi ? Ryoma sait que je ne veux plus avoir affaire avec ce type...${prompt}
  8472: Oh, bon... Écoutez bien. Tout a commencé il y a vingt ans...${prompt}
  8473: C'est ce que vous cherchiez, n'est-ce pas ? Exactement là où les anciens écrits disaient qu'il serait.${prompt}
  8474: Bon sang, tu es douée, Yomi. Comment as-tu...${prompt}
  8475: Un ninja ne serait pas bon s'il allait raconter ses secrets à tout le monde, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8476: |-
    Ha-ha. Vrai.
    Laissez-moi vous mettre au courant de votre prochaine mission.${prompt}
  8477: As-tu déjà oublié, Kagetora ? Je t'ai dit avant de partir que ce serait ma dernière mission.${prompt}
  8478: Mais tu plaisantais, n'est-ce pas ? Tu ne peux pas nous quitter maintenant.${prompt}
  8479: Non, je ne plaisantais pas. Si tu as des problèmes avec ma décision, tu peux en discuter avec Gilgamesh.${prompt}
  8480: Hé ! Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici, bon sang !?${prompt}
  8481: Pour penser qu'un rat comme celui-là finirait avec la main de la plus belle femme à avoir jamais mis les pieds à Norg... Oh, désolé, je me suis laissé emporter.${prompt}
  8482: Bref, ce parchemin que Ryoma veut déchiffrer est le même que celui que Yomi a utilisé pour sa dernière mission pour Norg.${prompt}
  8483: Toutes les informations à ce sujet ont été perdues après que Yomi et ce mari insecte aient déménagé ici.${prompt}
  8484: Si tu veux en savoir plus, essaie de demander à Ensetsu. Malmène-le un peu, et ce faible parlera sûrement.${prompt}
  8485: Ah, ${name-player}. Merci encore pour tout ce que vous avez fait pour ma fami...${prompt}
  8486: Quoi ? La dernière mission de ma femme ?${prompt}
  8487: Je peux vous dire ce que je sais... bien que ce ne soit pas grand-chose.${prompt}
  8488: Notre enquête sur le contenu de ce vieux parchemin nous a menés dans la région du désert d'Altepa sur l'île de Zepwell. Là, Yomi a réussi à le déchiffrer.${prompt}
  8489: 'Simple matelot, je suis resté sur le bateau pendant l''enquête, mais j''ai eu un aperçu du parchemin déchiffré. Les mots suivants y étaient écrits : “Cherchez le point dans le désert où les rations sont empilées les unes sur les autres.”${prompt}'
  8490: 'Cependant, Yomi s''est déjà rendue dans cette zone et a ramené ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} qu''elle y avait trouvé à Norg. Si vous vous rendiez là-bas maintenant, je ne sais pas si vous trouveriez quoi que ce soit.${prompt}'
  8491: 'Oui, cela ressemble à la même ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} que Yomi a ramenée d''Altepa il y a des années. Mais ça semble assez neuf... Qu''est-ce que ça pourrait signifier ?${prompt}'
  8492: 'Vous voulez en savoir plus sur la ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} ? Eh bien, je suis désolé, mais je vous ai dit tout ce que je sais.${prompt}'
  8493: Les informations que Yomi a découvertes lors de cette mission provenaient du petit-fils de Mitsunari.${prompt}
  8494: Mitsunari a laissé l'ancien parchemin à son petit-fils. C'est ce petit-fils qui a aidé Yomi à le déchiffrer.${prompt}
  8495: Quoi ? Vous aussi, vous avez été attaqué par des araignées venimeuses à l'emplacement indiqué sur ce parchemin - le même endroit où ma Yomi a été attaquée ?${prompt}
  8496: |-
    C'était un piège...
    Mitsunari avait beaucoup de connaissances en matière de poisons. Seul lui aurait pu concevoir un tel plan...${prompt}
  8497: Le petit-fils de Mitsunari vivait autrefois dans une tente quelque part dans le désert d'Altepa. Vous pourriez essayer de le chercher, mais où il réside maintenant, je n'en sais rien.${prompt}
  8498: Il y a eu du remue-ménage dans le quartier des Mines près de la rue des Minerais. On dit qu'un nouveau Gardien des Contes est apparu.${prompt}
  8499: Cela me semble louche, mais avec la disparition de leur aîné, Werei, tout est possible. Et la dernière chose que nous voulons est une révolte des Galka.${prompt}
  8500: Allez à la rue des Minerais et parlez à Aigle-Médecine. Il dit qu'il était là quand le remue-ménage a commencé.${prompt}
  8501: Je suppose qu'un aventurier de votre calibre a entendu parler de Norg.${prompt}
  8502: Eh bien, l'endroit est un havre pour les pirates. Ils ont même des liens avec le Tenshodo. En tout cas, c'est une zone qu'on ne peut pas prendre à la légère.${prompt}
  8503: C'est pourquoi nous voulons que vous y alliez en tant qu'émissaire. Rendez-vous auprès de Sir Naji au Bureau du Président pour les détails.${prompt}
  8504: Actuellement, l'Ingénieur en Chef Cid mène des recherches sur l'architecture à Ro'Maeve près du Sanctuaire de Zi'Tah. Votre prochaine mission est de vous y rendre pour l'assister.${prompt}
  8505: Rendez-vous auprès de l'Ingénieur en Chef aux Ateliers Métallurgiques pour plus de détails.${prompt}
  8506: Nous recherchons un aventurier détenant des informations vitales concernant une certaine enquête nationale.${prompt}
  8507: Le président lui-même a exprimé un grand intérêt pour ce cas. Rendez-vous au Bureau du Président pour les détails de cette mission.${prompt}
  8508: 'Vous avez été ordonné par le président de livrer cette ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. Une fois cette tâche accomplie, vous pouvez revenir ici pour votre prochaine mission.${prompt}'
  8509: Il semble que Bastok va vraiment commencer une enquête sur la patrie des Galka à Altepa.${prompt}
  8510: Votre rôle dans cette enquête vous conduira dans les Cavernes de Sable. Obtenez les détails de cette mission auprès de Mangeur de Fer au Bureau du Président.${prompt}
  8511: En continuation de l'enquête de Bastok sur Altepa, cette fois, vous vous rendrez sur l'île de Zepwell.${prompt}
  8512: Vous mènerez votre partie de l'enquête dans le Tunnel de Kuftal, qui relie le Cap Teriggan à l'île de Zepwell. Rendez-vous auprès de Croc de Dragon aux Mines de Zeruhn pour les détails.${prompt}
  8513: Le sénateur Alois a demandé votre aide.${prompt}
  8514: Il s'agit de quelque chose à propos d'une expédition à Vollbow...${prompt}
  8515: J'espère juste qu'il ne vous demande pas d'aller chercher des œufs de lézard à nouveau... Attendez, vous ne m'avez pas entendu dire ça.${prompt}
  8516: Récemment, un aventurier envoyé pour enquêter sur les Terres du Nord a été attaqué.${prompt}
  8517: Selon son rapport, l'attaquant ressemblait au chevalier noir Zeid.${prompt}
  8518: La chose étrange est que l'attaquant a remis une lettre à l'aventurière avant de la laisser partir. Maintenant, le contenu de cette lettre cause tout un émoi au Bureau du Président.${prompt}
  8519: On vous a demandé de vous présenter directement au Président Karst pour plus de détails.${prompt}
  8520: Aïe-aïe-aïe ! Ne me faites pas parler. J'ai mal partout !${prompt}
  8521: Essayez autant que vous voulez, il viendra un moment où l'échec sera inévitable.${prompt}
  8522: Canalisez cette douleur et cette amertume pour créer un nouveau plan.${prompt}

    Je ne peux pas en parler trop fort, mais avez-vous déjà vu un de ces énormes cristaux ?
    On les trouve partout dans le monde, loin dans la nature sauvage et profondément dans les donjons...${prompt}

    De ces cristaux, un pouvoir étrange et bizarre jaillit constamment.
    Notre équipe de recherche enquêtait sur ces émanations inhabituelles quand...${prompt}
  8530: Eh bien, regardez ça !${prompt}
  8531: Grâce à notre recherche, nous avons finalement réussi à réveiller les cristaux !${prompt}
  8532: |-
    Notre théorie sur ce qui dormait à l'intérieur des cristaux s'est révélée exacte !
    Cependant, ils n'ont pas apprécié d'être réveillés et nous ont attaqués.${prompt}
  8533: |-
    Pourquoi détestent-ils tellement parler avec nous qu'ils préfèrent se battre ?
    Et que se passerait-il sur Vana'diel si quelqu'un les vainquait ?${prompt}

    Ahahaha, that's justice for you!${prompt}

    ...Oh dear Goddess...
    Something terrible has happened. An adventurer just collapsed in front of me and hasn't regained consciousness.${prompt}
  8612: When he collapsed a cutesy-wutesy creature glowing with blue energy leaped out towards the north.${prompt}
  8613: Would the adventurer's condition be the fault of that blue-glowing pixie? It must be that creature called “Carbuncle” I've been hearing rumors about.${prompt}

    Please take this.

    Hmmm...
    Hrmmm...
    So it's time to use...no...${prompt}
  8630: |-
    Hello?
    You're an adventurer, right?
    Maybe you can help us out.${prompt}
  8631: Let me introduce myself and my companion. We're from the Rhinostery in Windurst.${prompt}
  8632: 'I was hired by the ministry to accompany this researcher to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit''s Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei''Yin/the Boyahda Tree] and assist her in her study of a series of giant crystals.${prompt}'
  8633: But what was waiting for us inside those crystals was more than I could deal with...${prompt}
  8634: |-
    We tried countless times, but I could not defeat that beast.
    Another researcher at the Rhinostery sympathized with our plight and developed an improved tuning fork.${prompt}
  8635: |-
    No no no no no!
    That crazy-wazy contraption won't provide us with any useful data!${prompt}
  8636: |-
    Listen, muscle-hussle brain.
    Science is not about winning or spinning, life or strife, even or Steven! It's a more delicate subjectaru!${prompt}
  8637: Do you see what I have to deal with? I don't know how much longer I can work with such a pessimist.${prompt}
  8638: |-
    That's where you come in.
    I was thinking of letting one of you adventurers test out the new fork and prove to my colleague that it is able to return data valuable to her research.${prompt}
  8639: |-
    No no no no no!
    Even if they use that half-rate spork, it'll take a tip-top summoner to defeat the prime avatar!${prompt}
  8640: |-
    Listen up.
    The fandangled ${item-singular: 1[2]} won't make it any easier for you to downright defeat the monster inside the crystal. Sure, it'll lower the power of the prime avatar to around ${number: 3}, but it will do the same to you! And on top of that, you'll only be able to summon that itty-bitty blue bugger, Carbuncle!${prompt}
  8641: And to make things worse, nobody-buddy else can enter the crystal with you! You'll be battling one-on-one, man-to-man, Taru-et-Taru!${prompt}
  8642: |-
    ...
    Yes, but ma'am... The Rhinostery has been pressing us to produce results. If we do not take some sort of action quickly...${prompt}
  8643: |-
    Hmmm...
    You do have a point there...
    I guess one round with a prime avatar wouldn't hurtaru.${prompt}
  8644: No, one round could not hurt.${prompt}
  8645: |-
    You know that you probably won't gain anything from this battle-waddle.
    Are you sure you still want the fork?${prompt}
  8646: |-
    Are you really-dilly sure?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fork me!
    On second thought...${prompt}
  8647: |-
    Well, you asked for it!
    Take this ${item-singular: 1[2]} and ring it near one of those giant crystals. The prime avatar won't be slap-happy to be woken up, and you'll have to deal with its wrath.${prompt}
  8648: 'I guess because you are helping us check out this new tuning fork, I can use my mighty-minty magic to warp you near the giant crystal in ${choice: 2}[Ifrit''s Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei''Yin/the Boyahda Tree]. When you''re ready, just show my companion the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  8649: 'The researcher who made the ${item-singular: 1[2]} warned that “the door home would only open to those who defeated the prime avatar.”${prompt}'
  8650: |-
    I'm not quite sure what that is supposed to mean, but I suggest that you prepare well before taking on this journey.
    Remember, you have to be at least a level ${number: 3} summoner.${prompt}
  8651: 'Are you and Carbuncle ready to fight the prime avatar as a level ${number: 3} summoner?${prompt}'
  8652: Also, regardless of whether you defeat the avatar or not, you will be unable to re-enter the protocrystal again for a number of days.${prompt}
  8653: |-
    Are you sure you are ready?
    ${selection-lines}
    Off to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree]!

    You defeated the prime avatar!?${prompt}
  8661: Ma'am!${prompt}

    Hmmm...
    Just as I thoughtaru. The prime avatar that you fought with this spunky-junky tuning fork was nothing but a fake. Researching real avatars with real tuning forks is how real researchers do real research in the real world!${prompt}

  8665: 'I don''t think you''ll get much out of it, but if you want to go get your buttaru kicked by the prime avatar again, all you have to do is ring another ${item-singular: 1[2]} near a giant crystal.${prompt}'
  8666: 'Remember that you must fight the prime avatar as a level ${number: 3} summoner. As you already know, this will not be an easy task. Prepare well for the battle.${prompt}'

  8672: |-
    Why do these avatars so despise talking with us that they would rather fight?
    And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?${prompt}
  8673: You were able to handle one all by yourself. You should have no problem defeating one with your buddy-wuddies. You'll help us out, right?${prompt}
  8674: Ahem, now let me introduce myself...${prompt}
  8675: Ah, you are back. How was your battle with the avatar?${prompt}

  8720: Quoi ? Elle a quoi !?${prompt}
  8721: Non. Je ne sais pas si le mot “malade” est le terme approprié pour décrire son état.${prompt}
  8722: Lors d'une excursion à Norvallen, Dariah et moi sommes tombés sur une magnifique fleur qui brillait doucement, telle un diamant. Cependant, lorsque Dariah a posé ses mains dessus, elle s'est soudainement effondrée.${prompt}
  8723: Elle respire encore, mais ne se réveille pas de son sommeil maudit. Quand j'ai demandé conseil à l'un des anciens Elvaan, il a nommé son état le redouté “sommeil de morte”.${prompt}
  8724: Nous avons tout essayé, des médicaments à la magie, pour la ramener, mais nos efforts ont été vains.${prompt}
  8725: Cependant, selon les anciens, il reste un espoir. Une mélodie ancestrale qui est censée réveiller quiconque--la “Chanson de Liberté”.${prompt}
  8726: Utiliser la “Chanson de Liberté” pourrait être notre seul espoir de ramener Dariah parmi nous.${prompt}
  8727: J'ai entendu l'histoire d'un grand barde qui a écrit une telle chanson...${prompt}
  8728: Il a composé cette mélodie miraculeuse pour l'aider à ramener un amour perdu...${prompt}

  8730: Mais penser que cette mélodie perdue est le seul moyen de sauver notre chère Dariah...${prompt}
  8731: C'est notre seul espoir. Nous devons l'aider.${prompt}

  8747: Je regrette de vous demander cela, ${name-player}, mais voudriez-vous m'assister dans ma quête pour sauver une vie ?${prompt}
  8748: Selon la légende, la “Chanson de Liberté” fonctionne en faisant appel à l'aide des anciens dieux.${prompt}
  8749: 'Les trois pages nécessaires pour compléter la chanson--la ${keyitem-singular: 5[2]}, la ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]}, et la ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}--sont situées au plus profond des donjons dispersés à travers Vana''diel.${prompt}'
  8750: Comme je l'ai expliqué plus tôt, pour sauver Dariah, nous devons rassembler ces trois pages et les faire traduire.${prompt}
  8751: D'après les informations que j'ai collectées, je sais qu'une des pages se trouve quelque part dans un château dans les Terres Maudites du Nord.${prompt}
  8752: J'ai aussi entendu parler de l'emplacement des trois pages.${prompt}
  8753: L'une serait cachée dans une grotte sous-marine près de la Jungle de Yuhtunga, tandis qu'une autre serait enfouie quelque part dans un labyrinthe sur une péninsule à l'est.${prompt}
  8754: Je m'occuperai de la traduction, mais j'ai besoin de quelqu'un pour m'aider à récupérer les trois pages...${prompt}
  8755: Ce n'est pas une tâche facile, mais je sens que votre cœur juste vous guidera dans votre voyage.${prompt}
  8756: Vous êtes revenu avec les trois pages ! Je ne sais pas... je ne sais pas quoi dire !${prompt}
  8757: Je vais commencer la traduction immédiatement. La vie de Dariah est en jeu... Il n'y a pas une seconde à perdre.${prompt}

    Je m'excuse...
    Tout ce que je t'ai dit à propos de Dariah...${prompt}
  8767: Tout cela était des mensonges.${prompt}

  8769: Il est vrai que notre groupe s'est rendu à Norvallen. Cependant, l'histoire concernant la fleur et la maladie de Dariah... rien de tout cela n'était vrai.${prompt}
  8770: Pourquoi as-tu fait...${prompt}
  8771: |-
    Dès que je l'ai vue, j'ai été ensorcelé.
    Son sourire... Son froncement... Ses forces... Ses faiblesses... J'en suis venu à aimer tout cela.${prompt}
  8772: Cependant, aussi grand que soit devenu mon amour pour elle, elle ne répondait pas à cet amour.${prompt}
  8773: Elle... Elle parlait souvent de toi, Carmelo.${prompt}
  8774: Gentil, intelligent... fort...${prompt}
  8775: Et donc j'ai décidé... de te tester.${prompt}
  8776: Me tester ?${prompt}
  8777: Je m'excuse pour mon méfait.${prompt}
  8778: Je voulais juste voir ta sincérité envers Dariah. Je voulais voir si tu l'aimais autant qu'elle t'aimait...${prompt}
  8779: '...!${prompt}'
  8780: Tiens, prends ça. Ce n'est pas grand-chose, mais c'est la seule chose que je peux faire pour te dire que je suis désolé...${prompt}
  8781: Attends. Je...${prompt}
  8782: Je t'ai sous-estimé, Carmelo...${prompt}
  8783: Prends soin de toi... et de Dariah.${prompt}
  8784: Alors... pourquoi avons-nous dû obtenir la “Chanson de Liberté” !?${prompt}
  8785: Et que voulait-il dire par “Prends soin de Dariah” !?${prompt}
  8786: Dariah et moi ne sommes plus...${prompt}
  8787: Eh bien, peu importe. Tant qu'elle est en sécurité...${prompt}
  8788: Je m'excuse pour tous les problèmes que je t'ai causés. S'il te plaît, prends ceci en signe de gratitude.${prompt}
  8789: Je te serai éternellement redevable pour ce que tu as fait pour moi. Cependant, j'ai une dernière demande...${prompt}

  8899: Two adventurers are approached separately and assigned the same task. Whoever completes the objective first gets the job.${prompt}
  8900: You seem to be well-informed...${prompt}
  8901: This isn't the first time they've tried something like this. The last time, the adventurers concerned were so involved with tripping each other up that their quarry got away.${prompt}
  8902: But it seems you've passed the test. The senator will be most pleased with the results, I'd wager.${prompt}
  8903: |-
    Hmph...
    Being evaluated like a prize chocobo does not endear me to the senator.${prompt}

    Listen well, adventurer.
    I am the victor this day, and I will brook no attempts to steal my position with the assassins!${prompt}
  8906: That one's ambition hasn't tempered any since he left Norg. Viresefilant never changes.${prompt}
  8907: He lusts after glory, even more so than skill and technique. Always wanting to serve under a person of prominence. When he heard that Ayame had become a Mythril Musketeer, he threw his training away and left Norg behind.${prompt}
  8908: He slipped into bodyguard work, and that's where the senator found him--a perfect candidate for his new organization.${prompt}
  8909: Why is Viresefilant so obsessed with fame, you ask?${prompt}
  8910: Probably his upbringing.${prompt}
  8911: Both parents were exceptional samurai. However, they led a spartan lifestyle and cared little for material wealth.${prompt}
  8912: I guess that was more than Viresefilant could take. He chose the path of a mercenary ninja and a life in the shadows.${prompt}
  8913: He decided against the way of the samurai and the lifestyle of his parents. And now Ayame, a samurai herself, has become a Mythril Musketeer. Ironically, Viresefilant's decision to train as a ninja ruined his chances to improve his station in life.${prompt}
  8914: You can bet that this twist of fate served as further fuel for his ambition, and allowed him to be manipulated by the senator's lies...${prompt}
  8915: Well damn, I'm chatty today. Starting to sound like an old man, criticizing somebody else's life like this...${prompt}

  8964: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  8965: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  8966: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  8967: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  8968: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  8969: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  8970: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  8971: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  8972: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  8973: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  8974: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  8975: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  8976: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  8977: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  8978: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  8979: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  8980: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  8981: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  8982: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  8983: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  8984: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  8985: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  8986: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  8987: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  8988: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  8989: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  8990: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  8991: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}

  8993: Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word “ballista” means “to throw a stone,” and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.${prompt}
  8994: |-
    The rules are simple.
    Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.${prompt}
  8995: 'Players from both teams must search for ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} that a ${color: 5}Herald${color: 1} has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  8996: 'These ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} into them.${prompt}'
  8997: Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.${prompt}
  8998: '${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the ${color: 5}Quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.${prompt}'
  8999: 'Sometimes a player may find items other than ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}, such as potions. These ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).${prompt}'
  9000: |-
    Players can carry more than one ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them.
    However, players will lose their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} if they:
    (1) Successfully throw them into a rook.
    (2) Leave the area.
    (3) Are knocked out.${prompt}
  9001: 'But don''t forget, a player will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command while in possession of a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. And, players can only use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command if they carry one of the stones.${prompt}'
  9002: As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.${prompt}
  9003: 'All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. This will temporarily increase one''s movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  9004: 'However, remember that once a player has obtained a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, he or she will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. In its place, though, one may use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command.${prompt}'
  9005: 'The locations of the ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.${prompt}'
  9006: 'Communication with one''s team members is, of course, one way to locate ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}. However, another way is by using the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  9007: 'Finally, ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} can only be used when a player is carrying a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. Because ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.${prompt}'
  9008: 'So, a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} has been obtained and a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1} located. Now all that''s left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.${prompt}'
  9009: There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.${prompt}
  9010: 'To throw a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} into a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}, a player must first wait until the ${color: 5}Rook''s${color: 1} gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.${prompt}'
  9011: |-
    But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status.
    Only then will his or her shots count.${prompt}
  9012: This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.${prompt}
  9013: Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.${prompt}
  9014: |-
    The following match types are area-specific:
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands
    Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains${prompt}
  9015: |-
    ${color: 5}Best of Three${color: 1} series rules are as follows:
    Winning a match will earn a nation one “match point.” The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for “come-from-behind” victories.${prompt}
  9016: Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.${prompt}
  9017: Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.${prompt}
  9018: When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.${prompt}
  9019: For more information on temporary items, refer to the “special rules.”${prompt}
  9020: After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.${prompt}
  9021: If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.${prompt}
  9022: |-

  9024: 'Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} for use at any time during the match.${prompt}'
  9025: 'Players can hold up to ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1}, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.${prompt}'
  9026: 'If players who possess ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.${prompt}'
  9027: Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.${prompt}
  9028: 'Finally, the Heralds will collect ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.${prompt}'
  9029: 'Ballista Points are rewarded to each competitor based on his or her performance in a single Ballista match. The maximum number of points that can be accumulated per match is ${number: 0}.${prompt}'
  9030: 'While it is taken into consideration, scoring ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} is not the only way to earn Ballista Points. Assisting allies and defeating members of the enemy forces can also earn a high score.${prompt}'
  9031: 'Ballista Points can be traded for special “vouchers,” which may be exchanged for free ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} at the start of new matches.${prompt}'
  9032: |-
    However, remember that depending on the level restriction of the match, certain vouchers will not be redeemed at the beginning of a match.
    Speak with a ${color: 5}Marshal${color: 1} directly after a match to register your points.${prompt}
  9033: 'Players will only be allowed to score up to five ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} at a time. Also, a player''s ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status will be automatically disengaged if a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} is not scored within a certain amount of time. The amount of time is increased for those members of the team currently behind in points.${prompt}'
  9034: 'All allies within a certain radius will achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status when a member of the enemy forces is defeated.${prompt}'
  9035: Players' resistance to sleep will be increased.${prompt}
  9036: 'During the entry period, from ${number: 0}:${number-2-digits: 1}, all adventurers will be allowed to join the forces with the smallest number of participants, regardless of allegiance. Open entries will be accepted until both sides have reached maximum capacity.${prompt}'

  9039: Please note that any participant who cancels his or her registration will not be allowed to re-apply for the same match.${prompt}
  9040: When the total number of participants in a match is less than 40, the location of the two camps will be adjusted. Also in this case, the number of Rooks will be reduced to two.${prompt}
  9041: Any adventurer whose main level is over 30 will receive EXP for participating in a Ballista match. However, no EXP will be rewarded if the adventurer fails to actively take part in the match.${prompt}

  9100: Non, je veux parler de la chose bizarre que tu portes sur ta tête... Bien sûr que je parle de l'aéronef !${prompt}
  9101: Eh bien, oui. Cet aéronef a été construit par le meilleur ingénieur de la République, Cid.${prompt}
  9102: D'accord, où est ce type, Cid ? Allez, fais-le sortir !${prompt}

    Welcome aboard.
    I am a researcher affilimiated with the Rhinostery in Windurst.${prompt}

  9127: |-
    I supposify we are the intruders from the Moblins' point of view.
    If only we could communificate with them somehow...${prompt}
  9128: But putting that aside, your task will be to acquiremirize any unusual Moblin-type objects you come across.${prompt}
  9129: |-
    And that doesn't mean pilferizing them from the inhabitants of Movalpolos!
    You are to find some friendly Moblins and obtainify items through your might of negotiation.
    Take care, bye bye now!${prompt}
  9130: Your task is to acquiremirize any unusual Moblin-type objects you come across.${prompt}

    Let me see...${prompt}
  9133: |-
    Well, this is most surprisifying!
    This looks like a book of worshipification!${prompt}
  9134: Is it possible that the Moblins worshipify the same Dawn Goddess as the Kingdom of San d'Oria?${prompt}
  9135: This discovery may help us to avoidimirize a conflict altogether.${prompt}
  9136: I'm not entirely sure what this is, but the smell is horrendificacious.${prompt}
  9137: |-
    Could this be some variety of Moblin beverage?
    I would like to transportimize this to the Rhinostery for further investimigation, but I doubt I'd be allowed on the airship!${prompt}
  9138: |-
    This is not a Moblin weapon as far as I can ascertainify.
    The style is closer to something producimicated in Bastok...${prompt}
  9139: It appears to be constructimified with a mineral that is rarely found these days.${prompt}
  9140: |-
    The engravimication on this piece is masterful.
    This must be the work of a talented goldsmith.${prompt}
  9141: Do the Moblins have goldsmiths, I wonder? Or could this be from...${prompt}
  9142: This is an identifimication tag worn by workers in Bastok's mines...${prompt}
  9143: "It appears to be of significant age. \nThe Moblins must have discoverified it in a tunnel somewhere.${prompt}"
  9144: "Hmmm.\nPlease indulgify my cogimitation a moment. \nI feel a hypothesis hatching from my subconscious ruminifications...${prompt}"
  9145: There is a name engravimified on that old tag you brought me.${prompt}

  9151: |-
    Have you heard about the commotion that occurified in the Steaming Sheep?
    A group of Goblins suddenly appeared and burstificated into the restaurant.${prompt}
  9152: Apparently they were trying to locatify a pair of patrons that was conversimirizing inside--a rusticated Galka and an Elvaan.${prompt}
  9153: |-
    But it didn't look like they were there for conflictimication.
    They said they had come to welcomify the pair.${prompt}
  9154: |-
    I wonder if they travelmilated all the way here from Jeuno.
    Those goblins must be very well-mannerified.${prompt}
  9155: Those strange Goblinlike beasts... When I was still young, I remember my master telling me stories of a strange tribe of beastmen who lived underground in a city known as “Movalpolos.”${prompt}
  9156: And that man they took away... He looked awfully familiar...${prompt}
  9157: I must say I was quite astonished when the group of little beastmen arrived in my establishment.${prompt}
  9158: However, to my surprise, they did not cause a single problem with any of my guests. They came in, walked over to a large Galka customer in tattered clothing, spoke with him for a few moments, and then all of them left.${prompt}
  9159: According to the guard that arrived a few moments after the Goblins had left, the beastmen first appeared in the Mines District before coming here. I wonder if everything is all right...${prompt}

  9163: Hm? What do you want?${prompt}
  9164: You're looking for a girl called Sanctia?${prompt}
  9165: From what I heard, Chieka bundled her into a box and threw her into the sea.${prompt}
  9166: Since the young lady was making such a fuss about getting to the Marquisate, she was dropped into the water off the coast of Tavnazia.${prompt}
  9167: If she had just kept her tongue still about Atarefaunet, Captain Chieka might have had pity on her.${prompt}
  9168: When Chieka was young and working on her she-devil reputation, she was chewed up and spit out by Atarefaunet.${prompt}
  9169: Anyway, Sanctia's probably feeding the fishes by now, and I don't mean by hand.${prompt}
  9170: Excuse me, Boss, but one of the boxes we unloaded from Captain Chieka's ship was empty.${prompt}
  9171: 'It was supposed to be filled with ${item-plural: 1[2]}...${prompt}'

    You'd better start looking!${prompt}

  9175: Unbelievable. There's no way an old sea dog like Chieka would waste her time with empty cargo.${prompt}
  9176: |-
    Where could the box have been emptied?
    Things just aren't going my way today...${prompt}

    Five ${item-plural: 1[2]}.

    Thank you.
    You've saved me a lot of trouble.${prompt}
  9182: |-
    I wanna tell you something.
    When I was unloading the cargo, I noticed this box wasn't filled with Tenshodo goods.${prompt}
  9183: Instead, there was a pretty young girl inside.${prompt}
  9184: Well, since she was invisible, I'm not really sure if she was pretty or not.${prompt}
  9185: In any case, I guessed it must have been the lass that Captain Chieka said she dumped into the ocean.${prompt}
  9186: I don't know if someone helped her out, or if she managed to escape herself, but thankfully she seemed okay.${prompt}
  9187: |-
    Hm? You're looking for this girl?
    Did she tell me her name was Sanctia?${prompt}
  9188: With all the people around, we didn't have much chance for conversation.${prompt}
  9189: |-
    But I'm sure she was headed for Selbina.
    Probably looking for another ship to Tavnazia, from what you tell me.
    Unless...${prompt}
  9190: There have been rumors of some weird eddy of darkness in a cave near Selbina that can take you to the Tavnazian Archipelago...${prompt}
  9191: They say a guy who entered that patch of Emptiness never returned.${prompt}
  9192: |-
    That story is still the talk of the town in Selbina.
    When your friend hears how dangerous it is, she'll give up on the idea, I'd say.${prompt}
  9193: Oh, si tu réussis à rattraper Sanctia à Selbina, dis-lui de la part de Patient Wheel de prendre soin d'elle, et de lui passer le bonjour.${prompt}

    You think I should change my headwear?${prompt}

    Windurst truly is a magical nation.
    I was just teleported from Windurst Woods to Windurst Waters in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  9564: |-
    Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.
    The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt}
  9565: |-
    Windurst is virtually governed by the Star Sibyl alone, right?
    Don't the ordinary citizens mind being sidelined from politics?${prompt}
  9566: Tarutaru residences are built to accommodate even the tallest Elvaans. But why build shelves so high up...?${prompt}
  9567: |-
    Windurst is famous for its hat shop.
    I can never visit the city without popping in at least once to check the latest styles.${prompt}
  9568: |-
    The hat shop in Windurst Waters has hoods with little ears attached on display.
    Are they not for sale?${prompt}
  9569: |-
    The restaurant food in Windurst is prepared by the Culinarians' Guild.
    I never miss a chance to indulge in one of their superb dishes.${prompt}

    I'm ashamed to admit it but...I'm hopeless at riding chocobos.
    I have my license, though. Really.${prompt}
  9575: |-
    Hmm.
    I can't think of anything to talk about.${prompt}
  9576: It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt}
  9577: Because the weather in town is usually either clear or cloudy, there's no need to carry a change of equipment. But since it can be quite unpredictable out in the wilderness, it's good to be prepared.${prompt}
  9578: Just between you and me, I obtained my armor here through unconventional methods.${prompt}
  9579: The other day I had to dash to an outpost to avoid being drenched in a sudden downpour.${prompt}

  9584: The other week I went to the Tenshodo to collect a pair of gloves I had ordered, only to discover they were closed for business that day.${prompt}
  9585: |-
    I have to change my shoes as soon as I get home or I can't relax.
    Does anything like that ever happen to you?${prompt}
  9586: |-
    And have you ever worried that the chocobo smell stays with you, even after you dismount?
    Maybe I'm being paranoid...${prompt}
  9587: |-
    ...
    Nope, the only thing that comes to mind is the weather.
    Not very interesting at all.${prompt}
  9588: |-
    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  9589: There's nothing I hate more than getting caught outside without the right gear for the weather.${prompt}
  9590: |-
    The range of goods is pretty good if you buy through this method.
    Unfortunately though, some items aren't always in stock, so you don't always get what you want.${prompt}
  9591: |-
    The guards wouldn't let me inside, if you can believe it!
    My best dress, ruined!${prompt}
  9592: |-
    But if you run around too much, your shoes get all soggy.
    And nobody likes soggy shoes now, do they?${prompt}
  9593: I like to be able to see what you're thinking.${prompt}
  9594: I wonder what kind of pet a moogle god would keep...${prompt}
  9595: |-
    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  9596: Of course, that didn't deter me in the least. I simply seized some of the staff and “persuaded” them to open shop.${prompt}
  9597: No one ever seems to want to swing a huge sword while wearing a tunic or a robe...${prompt}
  9598: I'm hopeless at keeping my room tidy, so I bought some furniture to store all my items.${prompt}
  9599: I went to the Blacksmiths' Guild the other day to have some armor repaired, but it turned out to be their day off.${prompt}
  9600: Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt}
  9601: I've got my eye on some new equipment, but they're way too expensive.${prompt}
  9602: I appreciate your concern for my equipment and all, but what about your own attire?${prompt}
  9603: |-
    Have you ever seen an aurora?
    It looks like a rainbow-colored curtain draped across the sky.${prompt}
  9604: |-
    I never know what to wear on windy days.
    I mean, you can't wear a skirt, right?${prompt}
  9605: |-
    I've noticed that beastmen seem to carry gil around.
    What on Vana'diel do they use it for?${prompt}
  9606: |-
    The smilebringers really exist, you know!
    They live somewhere far to the north!${prompt}
  9607: Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt}
  9608: In the Near East, a race of rat-like beastmen called Qiqirn live alongside common folk. Their information network is said to be impressive.${prompt}
  9609: |-
    I always thought it would look mysterious and unique.
    Maybe I just have no fashion sense...${prompt}
  9610: |-
    For some reason, my Mog House began to feel damp after that.
    Guess I bought too many vases...${prompt}
  9611: |-
    Why does that always happen on the very day you decide to go?
    Call me impatient, but I ended up just buying a new set of armor...${prompt}
  9612: You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt}
  9613: But if I wait a little longer, maybe the price will come down. It's pretty normal for items to become cheaper after a while.${prompt}
  9614: Why, you ask? Is it a crime to want your partner to look cool?${prompt}
  9615: |-
    I've heard they can weave cloth that looks just like it.
    You must be able to make beautiful clothes out of that material...${prompt}
  9616: Not that I ever wear skirts, anyway...${prompt}
  9617: |-
    Do they trade with people?
    I wonder what a beastman would buy...${prompt}
  9618: |-
    They dress in red robes and a red hat, and dance around in white subligaria.
    You believe me, don't you, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  9619: You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt}
  9620: |-
    But that reputation doesn't guarantee their information will always be accurate.
    After all, swindling isn't a race-exclusive occupation.${prompt}
  9621: |-
    You're probably thinking that I have a trunk full of armor.
    I actually trade my old gear in all the time.${prompt}
  9622: I've been meaning to tell you, but you shouldn't send me any deliveries.${prompt}
  9623: |-
    There are powerful enemies emerging all around us these days.
    We should keep up our training to avoid being overwhelmed in battle.${prompt}
  9624: |-
    It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls.
    No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.${prompt}
  9625: I've heard stories of people who can fight wyrms on even terms.${prompt}
  9626: You know, I'd love to visit your Mog House one day.${prompt}
  9627: You really feel like chatting today, I see.${prompt}
  9628: Do you eat out much?${prompt}
  9629: I've been trying different combinations of equipment, but I can't seem to make up my mind.${prompt}
  9630: |-
    What do you keep in your Mog House?
    Do you have furniture and stuff?${prompt}
  9631: |-
    It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls.
    No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.${prompt}
  9632: I usually spend my spare time on weapon maintenance and training. How do you spend yours?${prompt}
  9633: |-
    I have a friend in the business, you see.
    I'll introduce you sometime.${prompt}
  9634: The delivery people seem to have me mixed up with some other adventurer and I'm not getting my mail...${prompt}
  9635: |-
    Of course, I'll be there to fight beside you.
    Why don't we train together?${prompt}
  9636: I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.${prompt}
  9637: To become strong like that, how many hours a day do you think I should spend leveling?${prompt}
  9638: |-
    M...my Mog House, you ask? Out of the question!
    It's a total mess, with month-old half-eaten scraps...and much worse!${prompt}
  9639: Well, you could at least offer up a topic for conversation occasionally!${prompt}
  9640: |-
    Even though we get so much exercise, I start gaining weight if I eat too much good food.
    Must be a metabolism thing...${prompt}
  9641: |-

    I don't know what we'd do without you...
    Keep it up, kupo!${prompt}
  10017: |-
    You there.
    I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of ghosts?${prompt}
  10018: |-
    Have you heard?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ghosts!?
    Yes, I've heard.${prompt}
  10019: Then we may move on to more important matters.${prompt}
  10020: Would you be willing to aid me in exorcising these spirits?${prompt}
  10021: |-
    <Sigh>...
    Allow me to explain.
    I am an exorcist--a banisher of spirits.${prompt}
  10022: I have traveled here at the behest of a certain personage from this nation who is well aware of my skill in such matters.${prompt}
  10023: The request is fairly routine--I am to banish the spirits that have suddenly appeared within the town. But there is a problem...${prompt}
  10024: These ghosts are not simple apparitions.${prompt}
  10025: When they yet lived, they belonged to a witch coven known as the Dark Lilies.${prompt}
  10026: And they use the language of spirits--the Cursed Tongue. It is not a language I am familiar with.${prompt}
  10027: |-
    The art of the exorcist involves learning the mind of the spirit in order to bring it under control.
    I am at the point of capitulation.${prompt}
  10028: That is why I am calling on adventurers to aid me.${prompt}
  10029: I want you to disguise yourself as a monster, and try to eavesdrop on the spirit's mumblings.${prompt}
  10030: Once I learn of these ravings, I will be able to carry out my role as an exorcist.${prompt}
  10031: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt}
  10032: |-
    Ahaha...
    How droll.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  10033: |-
    Most excellent.
    There is one thing you must be aware of, however.${prompt}
  10034: These spirits were once people such as you and I. If they see you directly, there is a good chance they will see through your disguise.${prompt}
  10035: If, by chance, your disguise fails you, simply assume a monstrous form once again and continue your pursuit.${prompt}
  10036: I am aware of two spirits that haunt this town.${prompt}
  10037: The one known as Guwanana is the most alert and suspicious, so I will ask you to first track down the Mithran spirit by the name of Bikho Ronpotteh.${prompt}
  10038: Once you have a clear idea of why the ghost has appeared here, I want you to report your findings to me immediately.${prompt}
  10039: Good luck.${prompt}
  10040: |-
    Is that the glow of success I see upon your face?
    What of the spirit...?${prompt}
  10041: |-
    I see...
    So that is her purpose...${prompt}
  10042: The tale is tragic, but this world is no longer meant for one such as she.${prompt}
  10043: I will prepare for the exorcism.${prompt}
  10044: |-
    You have been a great help.
    Please take this as a token of my appreciation.${prompt}
  10045: |-
    This is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies.
    Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities.
    Enjoy yourself, and forget about this sorrowful affair.${prompt}
  10046: However, should you wish to aid in another exorcism, I would welcome your help.${prompt}
  10047: |-
    What has befallen you?
    Do you wish to give up?${prompt}
  10048: |-
    Give up?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm done.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  10049: |-
    A pity.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  10050: Then please return to your pursuit of the spirits.${prompt}
  10051: |-
    Ah, you're back!
    Perhaps you have enough experience now to stalk the more alert ghost of the two.${prompt}
  10052: Will you consent to aid me again?${prompt}
  10053: |-
    The second spirit is called Guwanana.
    She is well aware of her surroundings, so I urge the utmost care when following her.${prompt}
  10054: |-
    Good day!
    I suppose you've heard of all the ghost sightings around town?${prompt}
  10055: I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.${prompt}
  10056: |-
    I'll get straight to the point.
    Do you want to help in an exorcism?${prompt}
  10057: |-
    Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess.
    Let me give you the short version:${prompt}
  10058: I'm a stranger to this land, called in by one of those important types.${prompt}
  10059: |-
    For what?
    I happen to have a certain level of fame as an exorcist.
    You know--a banisher of spirits.${prompt}
  10060: But these spirits are proving to be a bit of a handful.${prompt}
  10061: They were powerful witches in life and used to belong to some famous coven.${prompt}
  10062: |-
    The worst thing is, they use some beastly language known as the “Cursed Tongue.”
    That's not a language I can understand.${prompt}
  10063: |-
    That's a problem because, as an exorcist, I need to learn what's in their hearts and minds.
    Then I can find a weakness.${prompt}
  10064: That's where you come in...${prompt}
  10065: I need you to disguise yourself as a monster and get close enough to find out what they're thinking.${prompt}
  10066: Once I know some details, I can begin the exorcism and rid this town of its unwelcome guests.${prompt}
  10067: |-
    What do you say?
    Will you help?${prompt}
  10068: |-
    Oh...
    Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  10069: |-
    Thank you!
    There is one thing you should know...${prompt}
  10070: |-
    These ghosts are a little vague, but they were once people too.
    If they get a good look at you, they'll know you're just wearing a costume...${prompt}
  10071: |-
    But don't give up if they catch on to you.
    Just put the disguise back on and try again.${prompt}
  10072: I've located two spirits floating around this town.${prompt}
  10073: |-
    The first one, Pretty Heart, is fairly sharp.
    I suggest you go after Selma, the second spirit, to get your feet wet.${prompt}
  10074: Once you've figured out why the ghost is here, you need to tell me about it right away.${prompt}
  10075: Good luck!${prompt}
  10076: Oho, looks like you've managed to learn something...${prompt}
  10077: |-
    Hmmm...
    So that's why...${prompt}
  10078: |-
    It might seem cruel, but that ghost no longer belongs here.
    The exorcism is for their sake as much as ours...${prompt}
  10079: It's time to begin my preparation.${prompt}
  10080: Oh, and this is for you.${prompt}
  10081: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    The design matches those worn by the coven I mentioned.
    Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.${prompt}
  10082: If you want to try your hand at ghost-chasing again, I'll be right here.${prompt}
  10083: Giving up the ghost?${prompt}
  10084: |-
    Oh...
    Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  10085: Then it's back to chasing spirits with you!${prompt}
  10086: |-
    You know what?
    I think you could probably track that other ghost now that you have some experience.${prompt}
  10087: What do you think?${prompt}
  10088: |-
    Your target's name is Pretty Heart.
    Wonder why he's called that...${prompt}
  10089: |-
    Really?
    I'm pretty sure you've got it in you...${prompt}
  10090: |-
    Hi, I'm Gertrude.
    I came to investigate the rumors of ghosts haunting this town.
    Have you heard anything?${prompt}
  10091: |-
    You have?
    Well, that makes my job easier, then.${prompt}
  10092: Do you think you could help out a struggling exorcist?${prompt}
  10093: |-
    No?
    Then let me fill you in on the details.${prompt}
  10094: I may not appear as such, but I'm actually an exorcist from a land far to the west.${prompt}
  10095: A certain personage from this nation summoned me to banish the spirits plaguing the city.${prompt}
  10096: But once I arrived, I discovered these ghosts were not your average apparitions.${prompt}
  10097: In life, they were fearsome witches and wielded destructive spells of tremendous power.${prompt}
  10098: Their strength has followed them into the afterlife, giving them a high level of resistance to my exorcisms.${prompt}
  10099: In this sort of case, I would usually find some clue from their former lives in order to empower my rituals.${prompt}
  10100: The problem is, these spirits speak the Cursed Tongue, and I can't understand enough of that language to learn anything.${prompt}
  10101: And so, I'm forced to call upon adventurers to aid me.${prompt}
  10102: Would you be willing to disguise yourself as a monster and try to discover what drives these beings?${prompt}
  10103: |-
    Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard.
    Please come back if you change your mind.${prompt}
  10104: |-
    Wonderful.
    There is one thing I must warn you of, however.${prompt}
  10105: These witches were once people, and are clever enough to see through your disguise should you be too careless.${prompt}
  10106: |-
    If they do happen to find you out, please don't give up.
    They will soon forget, and you can don your costume once again.${prompt}
  10107: According to my sources, there are two ghosts in this area.${prompt}
  10108: |-
    The one called Maryse is extremely vigilant and aware of her surroundings.
    I suggest you try following Poseaulloie first to get some practice.${prompt}
  10109: |-
    Once you've discovered the ghost's reason for remaining in this world, please inform me at once.
    There are many preparations to be made.${prompt}
  10110: Good luck!${prompt}
  10111: How did you fare...?${prompt}
  10112: I see, so that's why she...${prompt}
  10113: However, it is my duty to give her that little push she needs to leave this world behind.${prompt}
  10114: I will begin preparing for the exorcism.${prompt}
  10115: |-
    Your help has been invaluable.
    Would you accept this in appreciation?${prompt}
  10116: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...${prompt}
  10117: If you have time, I would gladly accept your help again.${prompt}
  10118: |-
    What's wrong?
    Have you grown tired of your task?${prompt}
  10119: |-
    Oh, I see...
    Well, please return to me if you find your patience for this task restored.${prompt}
  10120: |-
    Then I would ask you to return to your task.
    Good luck.${prompt}
  10121: Would you consider an attempt at following the more wily of the two spirits?${prompt}
  10122: I'm sure you have sufficient experience now.${prompt}
  10123: |-
    Then your next target is the one known as Maryse.
    Please be careful...${prompt}
  10124: |-
    You must recover your strength before you continue pursuing these supernatural intruders.
    Return to me once you have had time to rest.${prompt}
  10125: |-
    I appreciate the offer of help, but you're in no state to be chasing ghosts.
    Build your strength, rest your mind, and return to me when you're ready.${prompt}
  10126: I'm happy to have someone so cooperative on my side, but too much contact with spirits will drain your strength. Return to me on the morrow when you've had time to rest.${prompt}
  10127: |-
    !!!
    You...you're no monster!${prompt}
  10128: |-

  10138: |-
    I...
    I should no longer care...
    I want to forget...${prompt}
  10139: |-
    The fountain where he took his rest...
    The stones that grew wet with his tears...
    Nothing has changed...except me...${prompt}
  10140: |-
    The moat where he swam...
    The shade where he slept...
    It is still the same...${prompt}
  10141: |-
    Ah...I know you are there...
    But to have someone hear my pain...has lightened my soul...if only a little...${prompt}
  10142: This moat...where I fell in...${prompt}
  10143: |-
    I slipped...on the bridge...
    I fell...${prompt}
  10144: |-

  10460: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  10461: “Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt}
  10462: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  10463: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  10464: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  10465: “Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt}
  10466: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  10467: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}
  10468: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt}

  10475: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt}
  10476: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt}
  10477: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt}
  10478: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt}
  10479: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  10480: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  10481: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  10482: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  10483: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  10484: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  10485: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10486: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt}
  10487: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10488: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  10489: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  10490: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10491: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  10492: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  10493: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10494: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  10495: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt}
  10496: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}
  10497: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt}
  10498: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  10499: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  10500: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt}
  10501: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt}
  10502: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}

  10514: Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt}
  10515: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt}
  10516: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt}
  10517: You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt}
  10518: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt}
  10519: Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!${prompt}

    Pastes.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10521: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt}
  10522: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt}
  10523: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  10524: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  10525: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}
  10526: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt}
  10527: 'Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt}'
  10528: 'This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which ${item-plural: 0[2]} are most popular.${prompt}'
  10529: 'Chocobos also seem to enjoy ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  10530: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt}
  10531: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt}
  10532: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt}'
  10533: 'In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It''s a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt}'
  10534: Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.${prompt}
  10535: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, for example, affect the chocobo''s physical attributes, and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are good for its mental attributes. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are in a category of their own.${prompt}'
  10536: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  10537: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  10538: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'
  10539: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt}
  10540: 'The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt}'
  10541: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  10542: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo''s energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt}'
  10543: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt}'
  10544: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt}
  10545: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}
  10546: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt}
  10547: Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.${prompt}

    Which would you like to ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Abilities.
    Temperament.
    Weather preferences.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10549: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  10550: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  10551: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  10552: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  10553: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  10554: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  10555: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  10556: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  10557: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  10558: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}
  10559: 'When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  10560: 'You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  10561: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt}
  10562: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt}
  10563: 'You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}'
  10564: 'You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10565: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt}
  10566: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10567: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  10568: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt}
  10569: 'When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  10570: 'Also, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}''s power will grow weak after you''ve used it several times.${prompt}'

  10576: 'You can use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.${prompt}'
  10577: The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.${prompt}
  10578: 'Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, so good luck with that...${prompt}'

  10581: Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.${prompt}

  11703: |-
    Why not!?
    Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt}
  11704: We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt}
  11705: However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt}
  11706: The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt}
  11707: And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt}
  11708: Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt}
  11709: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  11710: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  11711: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  11712: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  11713: Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt}
  11714: Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt}
  11715: In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
  11716: Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt}
  11717: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  11718: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  11719: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  11720: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  11721: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  11722: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  11723: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  11724: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  11725: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt}'
  11726: You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt}
  11727: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  11728: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  11729: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  11730: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  11731: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  11732: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  11733: 'Ah, it says here that you are a member of the ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt}'

  11994: Shops, as well as attendants to assist you in siging up your chocobo for a race, are located on the promenade.${prompt}
  11995: It can be found just south of here.${prompt}
  11996: The promenade itself is split into eastern and western halves, both of which house all of the same facilities. Be sure to stop by and have a look when you get a chance.${prompt}
  11997: 'Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, as well as collecting your winnings.${prompt}'
  11998: There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.${prompt}
  11999: All chocobet centers are capable of providing the same services.${prompt}
  12000: The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.${prompt}
  12001: To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.${prompt}
  12002: 'The standard admission fee is ${number: 0} gil. Patrons who possess ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} may enter free of charge.${prompt}'

  12005: This racetrack is equipped with portals to transport our patrons to any of the three nations, as well as Jeuno and Al Zahbi.${prompt}
  12006: As you can see, we are regularly visited by a multitude of race fans, breeders, and jockeys from every realm imaginable. We have therefore relegated each portal to a single destination in an attempt to avoid congestion.${prompt}

    That's about it.${prompt}
  12012: A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt}
  12013: Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt}
  12014: In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt}
  12015: For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt}
  12016: The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt}
  12017: What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt}
  12018: Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12019: Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt}
  12020: The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt}
  12021: The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt}
  12022: The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt}
  12023: In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt}
  12024: Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt}
  12025: Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt}
  12026: For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt}
  12027: We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt}
  12028: No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt}
  12029: Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt}
  12030: As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt}
  12031: Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12032: Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt}
  12033: Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt}
  12034: The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt}
  12035: As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt}
  12036: Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12037: We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt}
  12038: Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt}
  12039: Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt}

    I'm fine, thanks.${prompt}
  12042: There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt}
  12043: First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt}
  12044: Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt}
  12045: Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt}
  12046: All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt}
  12047: A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt}
  12048: Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt}
  12049: There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt}
  12050: There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt}
  12051: 'Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt}'
  12052: 'In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt}'
  12053: The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt}
  12054: You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt}
  12055: 'To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt}'
  12056: The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt}
  12057: You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt}
  12058: After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt}
  12059: This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt}
  12060: We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}
    What is chocobetting?
    How do I bet?
    What are odds?
    When do I bet?
    How do I collect winnings?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  12062: Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt}
  12063: To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt}
  12064: Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt}
  12065: For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt}
  12066: And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt}
  12067: Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt}
  12068: The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt}
  12069: 'To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt}'
  12070: 'For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt}'
  12071: We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt}
  12072: Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt}
  12073: Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt}
  12074: It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt}
  12075: What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt}
  12076: 'Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt}'
  12077: The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt}
  12078: Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt}
  12079: Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt}
  12080: Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt}
  12081: 'Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt}'
  12082: 'Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  12083: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt}'
  12084: Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.${prompt}

  12147: With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt}
  12148: As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt}
  12149: “The Monster Races”!${prompt}
  12150: Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt}
  12151: |-
    Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.
    What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt}
  12152: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  12153: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  12154: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  12155: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  12156: Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt}
  12157: |-
    The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.
    It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt}
  12158: |-
    Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.
    If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt}
  12159: |-
    Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.
    Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt}
  12160: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'

  12162: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  12163: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  12164: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  12165: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  12166: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  12167: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  12168: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo''s performance.${prompt}'
  12169: |-
    You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.
    Thank you for your understanding.${prompt}
  12170: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  12171: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  12172: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  12173: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  12174: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  12175: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  12176: Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt}
  12177: |-
    We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.
    The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt}
  12178: |-
    Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.
    And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt}
  12179: |-
    As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.
    It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.
    Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  12180: |-
    In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.
    Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.
    It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt}
  12181: |-
    Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.
    These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt}
  12182: |-

  12250: ピヨピヨ！${prompt}
  12251: She says, “When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.”${prompt}
  12252: She says, “And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' all☆star!“${prompt}
  12253: She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt}
  12254: She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt}
  12255: She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt}
  12256: She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt}
  12257: She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt}
  12258: She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt}
  12259: 'Next we have ${choice: 0}[Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by ${choice: 0}[the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].${prompt}'

  12261: Sakura says, “This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.”${prompt}
  12262: Sakura says, “Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.”${prompt}

  12269: She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.${prompt}
  12270: She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.${prompt}
  12271: She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.${prompt}
  12272: And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.${prompt}
  12273: And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?${prompt}
  12274: The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.${prompt}
  12275: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.
  12276: And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...

  12284: Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
  12285: I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.${prompt}
  12286: Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!${prompt}
  12287: |-
    Yeah...
    Good luck, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  12288: Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.${prompt}
  12289: 'And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt}'
  12290: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt}
  12291: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt}
  12292: Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt}
  12293: They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt}
  12294: Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt}
  12295: Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt}
  12296: As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt}
  12297: ${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt}
  12298: Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt}
  12299: Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt}
  12300: 'And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt}'
  12301: ピヨッ！${prompt}
  12302: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt}
  12303: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt}
  12304: Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt}
  12305: Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt}
  12306: a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt}
  12307: This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt}
  12308: Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  12309: It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt}
  12310: We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt}
  12311: Well, there you have it.${prompt}
  12312: Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt}

  12327: Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt}
  12328: Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt}
  12329: What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt}
  12330: Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt}
  12331: Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt}
  12332: Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt}
  12333: Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt}
  12334: Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt}
  12335: 'And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d''Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d''Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt}'
  12336: Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt}
  12337: Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt}
  12338: Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt}
  12339: The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt}
  12340: When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt}
  12341: When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt}
  12342: And they're off!
  12343: Markovich, what did you think of the start?
  12344: Well, I fel--
  12345: ピヨピヨッ！
  12346: Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
  12347: Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  12348: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  12349: And as they pass the halfway mark...
  12350: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} holds on to the lead!'
  12351: '${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!'
  12352: 'While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  12353: 'While from behind, #${number: 2} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  12354: 'All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!'
  12355: Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
  12356: And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
  12357: ピヨピヨ！
  12358: Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”
  12359: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  12360: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  12361: 'Incredible! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed is approaching dangerous limits!'
  12362: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!'
  12363: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  12364: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed has begun to drop off!'
  12365: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has begun to tire!'
  12366: The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  12367: The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  12368: The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
  12369: The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
  12370: 'The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  12371: 'Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  12372: 'And yet ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems completely unaffected by the attack!'
  12373: And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  12374: And now they're approaching the final corner!
  12375: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  12376: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  12377: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  12378: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!'
  12379: The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  12380: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  12381: 'And ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} takes the crown!'
  12382: 'What''s this? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  12383: 'And it''s ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} by a beak!!!'
  12384: Let's take a look at the results...${prompt}
  12385: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})${prompt}'
  12386: There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt}
  12387: Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt}
  12388: Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt}
  12389: Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt}
  12390: |-
    What an amazing race!
    The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt}
  12391: 'What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird''s performance?${prompt}'
  12392: '${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt}'
  12393: The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt}
  12394: Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt}
  12395: Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt}
  12396: Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt}
  12397: The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt}
  12398: |-
    And there you have it.
    This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt}
  12399: And now, let's see the results from the last race.
  12400: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})'
  12401: And that's all she wrote, folks!
  12402: 'The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!'
  12403: Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
  12404: She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
  12405: She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
  12406: Until next time, race fans...
  12407: Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt}
  12408: 'Taking the crown for today''s race was none other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  12409: 'To the winning steed''s owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt}'
  12410: 'And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  12411: Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt}
  12412: |-
    Excellent race, ${name-player}!
    You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt}
  12413: Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt}
  12414: Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt}
  12415: But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt}

    Oh...?
    Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?${prompt}
  12431: I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt}
  12432: |-
    Is that so...?
    Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt}
  12433: |-
    Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.
    You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt}
  12434: Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt}
  12435: Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt}
  12436: |-
    But of course! I had forgotten all about it!
    Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!
    Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt}
  12437: |-
    But that's not where it ends!
    There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt}
  12438: |-
    A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.
    Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt}
  12439: It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt}
  12440: |-
    Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!
    But...${prompt}
  12441: But...?${prompt}
  12442: I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt}
  12443: |-
    I see...
    Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt}
  12444: |-
    You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.
    Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt}
  12445: |-
    But enough talking, I say.
    It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt}
  12446: |-
    Oh, yes, right...
    Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!
    It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt}
  12447: 'In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt}'
  12448: |-
    Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?
    I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt}
  12449: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don''t let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep''s clothing”!${prompt}'
  12450: I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt}
  12451: I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt}
  12452: Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt}
  12453: Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt}
  12454: With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt}
  12455: |-
    Whoopee!
    Bring them on, I say!${prompt}
  12456: |-
    Erm...yes...
    Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt}
  12457: Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt}
  12458: |-
    Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!
    Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt}
  12459: |-
    Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.
    I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt}
  12460: And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt}
  12461: |-
    My, oh my...!
    I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt}
  12462: |-
    A-ahem!
    I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt}
  12463: |-
    All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!
    Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt}
  12464: |-
    It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...
    <Sniffle>${prompt}
  12465: |-
    Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    ...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  12466: |-
    Hrmmm...
    Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt}
  12467: Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt}
  12468: |-
    What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!
    There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt}
  12469: Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt}
  12470: |-
    And won't you look at the lineup!
    This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?
    I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt}
  12471: And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt}
  12472: |-
    Huh?
    Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt}
  12473: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt}
  12474: |-
    <Gulp>
    You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt}
  12475: '...Professor Shantotto!${prompt}'
  12476: |-
    If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,
    as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt}
  12477: |-
    Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,
    four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt}
  12478: |-
    So if you care to hear out my little proposal,
    these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt}
  12479: |-
    With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...
    Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt}
  12480: |-
    With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?
    Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt}
  12481: First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt}
  12482: |-
    Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.
    I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt}
  12483: Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt}
  12484: |-
    Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”
    Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt}
  12485: Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt}
  12486: |-
    Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.
    If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt}
  12487: Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt}
  12488: |-
    For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.
    Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt}
  12489: |-
    Um...Professor Shantotto...
    Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt}
  12490: |-
    Ohohohohoho!
    Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.
    But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt}
  12491: |-
    Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.
    Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt}
  12492: |-
    Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.
    So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt}
  12493: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--
    that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt}
  12494: |-
    The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.
    But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt}
  12495: |-
    H-hey!
    What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt}
  12496: |-
    My, my, what a pleasant surprise!
    I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt}
  12497: |-
    How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!
    This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt}
  12498: |-
    Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.
    I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt}
  12499: |-
    And you, Goccilo!
    What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt}
  12500: |-
    Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!
    Until next time...!${prompt}
  12501: ${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt}
  12502: |-
    What's with the baffled expression?
    It's me, Sakura.${prompt}
  12503: |-
    You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.
    I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt}
  12504: I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt}
  12505: I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt}
  12506: And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt}
  12507: I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt}
  12508: Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt}
  12509: I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  12510: I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12511: |-
    And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    But something seems to be different...
    Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt}
  12512: She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt}
  12513: The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt}
  12514: |-
    I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!
    A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt}
  12515: And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt}
  12516: It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt}
  12517: |-
    And that completes the lineup, folks.
    With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt}
  12518: 'You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12519: Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12520: I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt}
  12521: I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt}
  12522: I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt}
  12523: |-
    But no more...
    If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt}
  12524: This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt}
  12525: I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12526: Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt}
  12527: Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  12528: I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt}
  12529: Next, we have Sakura...${prompt}
  12530: |-
    Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
    This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt}
  12531: |-
    Well I'll be...
    In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt}
  12532: '...${prompt}'
  12533: |-
    Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.
    For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt}
  12534: '${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt}'
  12535: |-
    Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!
    Congratulations!${prompt}
  12536: |-
    Great race, ${name-player}.
    It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt}
  12537: |-
    But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..
    With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt}
  12538: |-
    Princess...
    Princess Sakura!${prompt}
  12539: |-
    Princess...?
    What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt}
  12540: |-
    Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.
    I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt}
  12541: Searching for...me?${prompt}
  12542: |-
    Yes, Your Highness.
    You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt}
  12543: |-
    Are you serious!?
    Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt}
  12544: |-
    That is correct.
    Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt}
  12545: D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt}
  12546: |-
    ...!
    I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt}
  12547: Wh...what happened?${prompt}
  12548: |-
    You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.
    You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt}
  12549: She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt}
  12550: |-
    Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.
    But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt}
  12551: My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt}
  12552: So that's what happened...${prompt}
  12553: Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt}
  12554: '...${prompt}'
  12555: I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt}
  12556: |-
    Your Highness!
    But...why!?${prompt}
  12557: Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt}
  12558: What's more...${prompt}
  12559: I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt}
  12560: I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt}
  12561: What...?${prompt}
  12562: The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt}
  12563: |-
    And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?
    I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt}
  12564: I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt}
  12565: |-
    Heehee!
    Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt}
  12566: |-
    ${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!
    Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt}
  12567: You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  12568: Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt}
  12569: |-
    What?
    How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt}
  12570: |-
    Hohoho...
    It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt}
  12571: I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt}
  12572: |-
    Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?
    No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt}
  12573: Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt}
  12574: |-
    <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.
    But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt}
  12575: |-
    You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.
    To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt}
  12576: |-
    And you, our new Chocochampion!
    Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt}
  12577: |-
    Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.
    These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt}
  12578: And they're off!
  12579: |-
    Hrmmm!
    ${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
  12580: Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
  12581: |-
    All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.
    But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
  12582: Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  12583: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  12584: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  12585: The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  12586: The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
  12587: And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  12588: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  12589: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!'
  12590: The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  12591: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!'
  12592: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  12593: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  12594: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  12595: 'What''s this? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  12596: '${number: 1}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}${prompt}'
  12597: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!'
  12598: 'Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!'
  12599: |-
    ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!
    And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
  12600: "I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s step. \nAnd the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!"
  12601: |-
    And here's some unexpected drama, folks!
    The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
  12602: 'Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!'
  12603: |-
    Uh-oh, what's going on here!?
    The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
  12604: 'Oooh! In a bold move, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!'
  12605: |-
    What's this!?
    All of the chocobos other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
  12606: |-
    Thanks to that brazen little act, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!
    That just might seal the deal for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!
  12607: |-
    Never in all my days, race fans!
    In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
  12608: |-
    How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?
    In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
  12609: Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
  12610: The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
  12611: The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
  12612: The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
  12613: |-
    Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?
    What in the world do you think you're doing!?
  12614: |-
    Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.
    This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
  12615: |-
    What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?
    I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.
    This could get heavy, folks!
  12616: |-
    All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.
    Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
  12617: It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
  12618: |-
    There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!
    More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
  12619: And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
  12620: |-
    The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.
    This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
  12621: |-
    This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.
    Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
  12622: |-
    And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!
    Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
  12623: |-
    And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!
    But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
  12624: |-
    I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!
    Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
  12625: |-
    It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!
    The time for a final spurt is now or never!
  12626: And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?

  12944: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  12945: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  12946: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  12947: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  12948: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  12949: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  12950: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  12951: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  12952: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  12953: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  12954: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  12955: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  12956: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  12957: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  12958: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12959: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  12960: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  12961: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  12962: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  12963: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  12964: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  12965: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  12966: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  12967: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12968: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  12969: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  12970: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  12971: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  12972: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  12973: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  12974: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  12975: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  12976: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  12977: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  12978: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  12979: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  12980: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  12981: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  12982: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  12983: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  12984: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  12985: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  12986: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  12987: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  12988: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  12989: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  12990: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  12991: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  12992: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  12993: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12994: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  12995: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  12996: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  12997: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  12998: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  12999: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  13000: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  13001: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  13002: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  13003: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  13004: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  13005: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  13006: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  13007: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  13008: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  13009: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  13010: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  13011: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  13012: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  13013: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  13014: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  13015: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  13016: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  13017: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  13018: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  13019: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  13020: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  13021: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  13022: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  13023: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  13024: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  13025: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  13026: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  13027: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}

    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  13048: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  13049: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'

    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  13051: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  13052: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  13053: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  13054: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  13055: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  13056: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}

    Hé ! Toi là !
    J'ai une proposition à te faire, à toi ${choice: 1}[un aventurier au visage frais/un aventurier en pleine forme/un aventurier de classe mondiale] comme toi !${prompt}
  13430: Tu peux m'appeler Clarion Star. Je viens de Jeuno, la jolie ville au nord-est qui relie les continents de Quon et Mindartia.${prompt}
  13431: Plus précisément, je suis un représentant de l'Institut des Études Magiques de Jeuno. Tu pourrais m'appeler un chasseur de têtes !${prompt}
  13432: Bwahaha ! Et les têtes que je chasse aujourd'hui sont celles d'explorateurs aux yeux pétillants comme toi !${prompt}
  13433: Alors voici le marché. Il n'y a pas longtemps, l'institut a organisé une sorte de symposium international, au cours duquel nous avons annoncé le développement d'un nouveau type de magie fascinant et utile.${prompt}
  13434: Nous l'avons rendu disponible pour que tout le monde puisse l'utiliser, et nous l'essayons donc ici à Bastok et dans d'autres endroits à travers Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13435: Nous avons choisi d'appeler cette nouvelle magie “Trust,” et en tant que délégué officiel de l'institut, je veux que des aventuriers de ton calibre soient les premiers participants chanceux.${prompt}
  13436: |-
    Alors ? Qu'en est-il ?
    Veux-tu essayer ?${prompt}

    Qu'est-ce que j'ai à perdre ?
    La magie me fait peur.${prompt}
  13438: Un aventurier qui a peur de la magie ? Pffft. Tant pis pour toi, mon pote.${prompt}
  13439: C'est le genre de cran que j'aime !${prompt}
  13440: Tu es sûrement au courant que Bastok n'est pas étranger au développement de nouvelles technologies, et c'est pourquoi Cid et les Mousquetaires Mythril mènent des recherches sur l'application de cette nouvelle magie.${prompt}
  13441: Tu sais comment ils sont--toujours en conflit avec la Confédération des Bêtes. Ils pensent que Trust pourrait aider à "renforcer leurs forces", disent-ils.${prompt}
  13442: Cependant ! Ce n'est pas à la portée de tout le monde d'utiliser Trust.${prompt}
  13443: Comme tu peux l'imaginer, l'institut collecte donc des données à San d'Oria et à Windurst aussi, essayant de faire participer le plus de monde possible.${prompt}
  13444: Il ne devrait donc pas être surprenant que nous ayons d'autres représentants dans ces deux nations. Si tu préfères te rendre là-bas, alors nous n'avons plus rien à discuter...${prompt}
  13445: Mais je suis sûr que les Mousquetaires Mythril ici apprécieront toute l'aide que tu pourrais leur apporter.${prompt}
  13446: Allons droit au but. Les aider te permettra de bénéficier de l'aide d'un puissant guerrier, ce qui ne pourra que t'aider dans tes voyages.${prompt}

  13450: '${choice: 2}[Dans ce cas,/D’accord! Alors] allons droit au but. Avant d’aller plus loin, laisse-moi te donner ceci.${prompt}'

  13452: Sais-tu où c'est ? Il suffit de monter l'escalier derrière moi et de traverser le pont vers l'ouest. Quelqu'un dans les marchés juste après pourra te guider davantage.${prompt}
  13453: Prends l'ascenseur jusqu'au deuxième étage, où tu le trouveras en attente près de l'escalier menant au bureau du président. Personne dans tout le pays n'est aussi fidèle ou habile que lui en tant que garde.${prompt}

    Où se trouvent les participants à Trust.
    Rien pour l'instant.${prompt}
  13456: Trust est une nouvelle catégorie de magie développée et annoncée par l'Institut de Magie de Jeuno.${prompt}
  13457: Bien que ce soit une forme de magie, contrairement aux sorts ordinaires, elle ne nécessite pas de mana. Elle puise plutôt dans le pouvoir de la confiance, de l'amitié et de l'amour ${choice-player-gender}[fraternel/sororal].${prompt}
  13458: L'amitié, bien sûr, franchit toutes les frontières, donc la magie Trust peut être utilisée quelle que soit votre classe.${prompt}
  13459: Mais pour l'amour de tout ce qui est sacré, ne vous promenez pas à lier des liens avec des alter ego dans les villes. Cela troublerait tout le monde.${prompt}
  13460: Utiliser la magie Trust fait apparaître un alter ego de quelqu'un avec qui vous avez formé un lien personnel fort.${prompt}
  13461: On dit que l'amitié fonctionne mieux quand elle repose sur une relation d'égal à égal. Ainsi, l'alter ego n'est aussi puissant que la personne qui l'a fait exister.${prompt}
  13462: L'alter ego se battra volontiers à vos côtés, mais vous ne pourrez pas lui donner des ordres directs.${prompt}
  13463: Des recherches sont en cours, mais il pourrait falloir un certain temps avant que des progrès concrets ne soient réalisés.${prompt}
  13464: Lorsque vous souhaitez libérer un alter ego de son service, il vous suffit de lui parler.${prompt}
  13465: Il va sans dire que si un alter ego tombe au combat, il disparaîtra dans les airs. Mais ne vous inquiétez pas -- vous pourrez l'invoquer à nouveau après un certain temps.${prompt}
  13466: La magie Trust porte bien son nom. Elle invoque un alter ego grâce au pouvoir de la confiance, de l'amitié et de l'amour ${choice-player-gender}[fraternel/sororal].${prompt}
  13467: Pour utiliser ses pouvoirs, vous devez d'abord trouver et vous lier d'amitié avec quelqu'un qui peut les maîtriser.${prompt}
  13468: S'ils n'écoutent pas votre demande, c'est peut-être qu'ils ne vous estiment pas suffisamment. Faites parler la ville de vos exploits et je suis sûr qu'ils vous donneront une nouvelle chance. Si ils n'écoutent toujours pas -- eh bien, revenez me voir.${prompt}
  13469: Bien sûr, ils pourraient toujours ne pas vouloir être amis. Peut-être êtes-vous comme moi, destiné à être seul pour toujours ! Bwahaha ! <Sob>${prompt}
  13470: 'Oh ho${choice: 5}[/, j’ai presque oublié]! Il existe une autre manière d’utiliser cette magie. Il y a des enquêtes en cours pour savoir comment invoquer un alter ego sans rencontrer directement la personne.${prompt}'
  13471: Cela nécessite quelque chose de spécial, mais si vous trouvez un parchemin avec cette capacité exceptionnelle, il vous suffira de me le donner.${prompt}

  13489: Ah, la fraîcheur de la jeunesse qui acquiert un nouvel alter ego. Jamais je ne me lasserai de cela.${prompt}
  13490: Je vais vous confier quelque chose -- l'initiative Trust se répand au-delà des cinq races... avec des résultats très intéressants.${prompt}
  13491: Fermez les yeux et allez dans votre endroit heureux, où la confiance, l'amitié et l'amour ${choice-player-gender}[fraternel/sororal] fleurissent comme des fleurs de lin dans une prairie.${prompt}
  13492: Quel succès incroyable !${prompt}
  13493: Tant de nos essais ont échoué. J'espérais que cela puisse marcher... mais cela -- c'est au-delà de mes rêves les plus fous !${prompt}

  13654: Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.${prompt}
  13655: Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.${prompt}
  13656: “Unity” is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.${prompt}
  13657: Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt}
  13658: 'Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt}'
  13659: Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt}
  13660: You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt}
  13661: Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt}
  13662: The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt}
  13663: Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt}
  13664: Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt}
  13665: “Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13666: These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt}
  13667: Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt}
  13668: Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt}
  13669: The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt}
  13670: A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt}
  13671: Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt}
  13672: Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt}
  13673: When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt}
  13674: Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  13675: No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt}
  13676: You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt}
  13677: An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt}
  13678: One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt}
  13679: A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt}
  13680: You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.${prompt}
  13681: Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.${prompt}
  13682: Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.${prompt}
  13683: Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.${prompt}
  13684: The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.${prompt}
  13685: It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.${prompt}
  13686: The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.${prompt}
  13687: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  13688: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt}
  13689: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt}
  13690: 'Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of ${number: 0} accolades per week (Earth time).${prompt}'
  13691: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt}
  13692: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt}
  13693: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt}
  13694: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt}
  13695: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt}
  13696: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt}
  13697: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt}
  13698: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt}
  13699: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt}
  13700: 'Additionally, an individual''s evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity''s ranking is the average of all eligible members'' individual evaluations.${prompt}'
  13701: The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt}
  13702: Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt}
  13703: 'Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt}'
  13704: Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt}
  13705: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt}
  13706: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt}
  13707: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt}
  13708: It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt}
  13709: Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.${prompt}

  13872: I would have expected many more people to choose to dress up as her, but it looks like you blew the competition away before they could even come out!${prompt}
  13873: No one wanted to choose me...
  13874: Huh!?
  13875: And if it isn't the woman, the myth, the legend herself! Ayame, would you give us your impression of the contestant's best attempt at reproducing your loveliness?${prompt}
  13876: |-
    Uh...
    Well, yes, it certainly is quite the sight.${prompt}
  13877: I might not be the, uh, most popular choice, but I'm touched that someone chose me as their inspiration.${prompt}
  13878: Oh, no, Ayame, it has nothing to do with popularity! People are just so blinded by your brilliance that no one felt they could even hold a candle to you. Isn't that right?${prompt}
  13879: Oh, yes! Of course! I'm, um, sorry that I couldn't hold a candle...${prompt}
  13880: And that's a big fat no from me! It seems our participant finally realized that they can't cut the mustard!${prompt}
  13881: Thanks...I guess?${prompt}
  13882: That's right, Ayame is just completely untouchable!${prompt}
  13883: Let's move on to our next contestant, shall we?${prompt}
  13884: Wow, I can't believe that someone would actually choose Azima, perhaps the stuffiest woman in all of Bastok!${prompt}
  13885: When I see your stunning profile, as wrinkled and gnarled as the old oak tree mere moments before it is felled by the lumberjack...${prompt}
  13886: I think back on my own mother, may she rest in peace...${prompt}
  13887: What ya blabbering on about, talking about me like I'm some old hag!?${prompt}
  13888: Urk--!
  13889: Why, if it isn't the esteemed Azima herself, here to give us her frank assessment of our challenger!${prompt}
  13890: Oh no, you don't escape that easily, young lady. I heard every word you said!${prompt}
  13891: N-n-no! Don't hurt me! I was just providing some color commentary!${prompt}
  13892: Hmmm. I suppose I could give ya an honest opinion.
  13893: Try learning some respect for your elders!${prompt}
  13894: Look at the fire in her eyes--obviously a reflection of the pile of hot garbage she sees before her!${prompt}
  13895: H-hey! I did my best...${prompt}
  13896: And yet another catastrophic failure abandons the stage! Azima's biting tongue remains too much to bear!${prompt}
  13897: I can't believe youngsters these days...${prompt}
  13898: Don't let this put a damper on your spirits, folks, for the show must go on!${prompt}
  13899: Would you take a look at this--a recreation of the magnificent Iron Eater, whose steely gaze can silence even the loudest of crying babies!${prompt}
  13900: True to his name, he can devour even the toughest of metals!${prompt}
  13901: I really don't think that he--${prompt}
  13902: For this contestant, let's hear from one of our female judges!${prompt}
  13903: I-Iron Eater?${prompt}
  13904: Amazing! Even Hilda is fooled by the costume's incredibly high degree of accuracy!${prompt}
  13905: Hey, Ken, you're finally starting to sound like a real emcee!${prompt}
  13906: Well, given how much you've talked over me across the years--${prompt}
  13907: But no, our contestant is not, in fact, the real thing!${prompt}
  13908: Wh-what the--!?
  13909: So, Hilda, what do you say!?${prompt}
  13910: Our challenger looks like Iron Eater, but the mannerisms are missing a little...je ne sais quoi.${prompt}
  13911: Je-ne-sais-what now?${prompt}
  13912: Ahhh, I think I get it. No matter how accurate you can recreate the outfit, it is all for naught unless you can properly mimic the original's quirks! Yes, another person for our ever-growing trash heap!${prompt}
  13913: Marin...I think you're being a bit too harsh on everyone.${prompt}
  13914: So crawl back under the rock you call home and show not your face again!${prompt}
  13915: Feast your eyes on our next model--a true sight to behold!${prompt}
  13916: Why, look at the aura of loserness emanating from him! Absolutely true to the original!${prompt}
  13917: Can't you be a little more positive!?${prompt}
  13918: Let's hear from one of our female judges. Hilda?${prompt}
  13919: I-is that Naji!?${prompt}
  13920: Wow! If she really thinks that's Naji, the costume must be perfect!${prompt}
  13921: Hey, Ken, you're finally starting to sound like a real emcee!${prompt}
  13922: Well, given how much you've talked over me across the years--${prompt}
  13923: I've, uh, got some unfortunate news. Naji was scheduled to give a few words, but I'm afraid he can't be here today.${prompt}
  13924: Oh no! What a terrible turn of events!
  13925: But, uh, our audience remains unfazed by this unexpected twist!${prompt}
  13926: Yet someone just like him is right up there on the stage.${prompt}
  13927: Ah, and you mean to say that our contestant is close enough to the real Naji.${prompt}
  13928: Or, to put it another way, everything would have turned out the same with or without Naji here!${prompt}
  13929: I don't think you should be putting words in her mouth...${prompt}
  13930: Anyway, thank you, Naji! I'm sure your efforts will be reflected in your final score!${prompt}
  13931: |-
    And next, we've got--
    Ack!${prompt}
  13932: Zeid...
  13933: Ha ha ha!
  13934: Amazing costume! This is clearly the pinnacle of mankind's achievement!${prompt}
  13935: You don't know how difficult it was to get ahold of all this rare equipment!${prompt}
  13936: All that mythril set me back an arm and a leg.${prompt}
  13937: Mythril...?${prompt}
  13938: You do cut an impressive pose, to be sure, but there's something about you that isn't quite Zeid-like...${prompt}
  13939: Ah, yes! Now that's more like the Zeid I know.${prompt}
  13940: This costume is absolutely perfect! You should follow this young man's lead and make your Zeid outfit more like his!${prompt}
  13941: You there! I'm enlisting you into our little show. Come up onto the stage!${prompt}
  13942: Yes, you! Come on, being asked to participate in such a wonderful show is quite the honor! Get your rear in gear!${prompt}
  13943: I, uh, just came here to talk to Oggbi...${prompt}
  13944: Of course, of course! What Oggbi thinks of your outfit is quite important indeed! So take the stage and hear just what he thinks of your getup!${prompt}
  13945: Oggbi, I'd really prefer to talk someplace quieter...${prompt}
  13946: So, judges, what do you have to say about this magnificent Zeid costume?${prompt}
  13947: I don't think I've ever seen a more impressive Zeid! Everything is just as it should be--the way you walk, the way you talk...it's uncannily close to the real thing!${prompt}
  13948: Wherever did you get such wonderful equipment? It's absolutely marvelous!${prompt}
  13949: I don't think the real Zeid is supposed to be in Bastok right now...${prompt}
  13950: Why, even Oggbi is fooled by the realism that our newest contestant exudes! Spectacular!${prompt}
  13951: Why, Zeid-alike, I think our judges are beyond impressed by the extent of your efforts!${prompt}
  13952: What the heck is going on?${prompt}
  13953: It's like you're actually him...!${prompt}
  13954: <Sigh>...
  13955: While I'd love to be able to chitchat with you more, Zeid-alike, we've got some more contestants to get through!${prompt}
  13956: And without further ado, here's our next challenger...
  13957: '${choice: 0}[Azima/Naji/Black Mud/Michea/Nbu Latteh]!${prompt}'
  13958: Why, this is the costume to end all costumes! Look at how ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] positively gleams with radiance!${prompt}
  13959: I bet our maven of fashion, Brygid, is brimming with pride at how you've really helped bring the show together!${prompt}
  13960: I'm impressed by the accuracy of your attempt. But my opinions don't matter as much as the judges'!${prompt}
  13961: Surely the audience also appreciates all the effort you put into your appearance!${prompt}
  13962: Well, you certainly do have an...interesting take, to be sure! Words fail me.${prompt}
  13963: So, uh, Ken! Take it away!${prompt}
  13964: I...well...yes, words fail me, too.${prompt}
  13965: '...${prompt}'
  13966: Yes, yes, this is exceptional. The time and effort you must have put into this is astounding.${prompt}
  13967: I absolutely love it. I'd love to have you wait on me hand and foot...or is that asking a bit too much?${prompt}
  13968: Something is a little off...but then again, Naji himself is usually a little off, too.${prompt}
  13969: You're right, Cid. Naji always did have a couple screws loose.${prompt}
  13970: Hahaha!${prompt}
  13971: You put nearly no thought and effort into this, did you? Yet that in and of itself is rather Naji-esque.${prompt}
  13972: Speaking of Naji, it's about time for him to pay his tab...${prompt}
  13973: We were scheduled to hear a few words from Naji himself, but unfortunately he can't be with us today.${prompt}
  13974: So instead, Ken will give us the final word!${prompt}
  13975: M-me!? Well...thanks for coming!${prompt}
  13976: And there we have it, folks! A big round of applause for our Naji lookalike!${prompt}
  13977: Hang on...${choice-player-gender}[he/she] looks nothing like Azima.${prompt}
  13978: O-oh no. I can feel all the war memories come flooding back...${prompt}
  13979: I may have only caught a glimpse of her once, but that matronly figure cannot be denied.${prompt}
  13980: Perfect. Absolutely perfect. I remember once having thought that she was the wickedest of witches.${prompt}
  13981: War memories? What the--${prompt}
  13982: My goodness, you certainly have Azima down to a T. I can feel her gaze of self-superiority bearing down on me even now.${prompt}
  13983: Yes, you certainly do have the same air of competence about you.${prompt}
  13984: Azima and I have a long history. Why, it was she who introduced me to my now-husband.${prompt}
  13985: Really? She did that!?${prompt}
  13986: Wait, this is supposed to be an Azima outfit? Hmm...${prompt}
  13987: Haha! For a moment, I thought I misheard, too!${prompt}
  13988: And now we'll hear from Azima herself!${prompt}
  13989: “The Hermitess of the Highlands”...${prompt}
  13990: The what!?${prompt}
  13991: Yes, that is what they used to call me! And you, young one, can certainly make something from nothing.${prompt}
  13992: I have no idea what you're on about, Azima, but thanks for your insight! A big round of applause!${prompt}
  13993: Outstanding work, adventurer! You took someone who doesn't really stand out from the crowd and brought them to life!${prompt}
  13994: Workers of all stripes really deserve more recognition for their efforts. Why, even my apron was made by a skilled laborer such as him.${prompt}
  13995: And let's all be thankful that no one but you wears something like that.${prompt}
  13996: Black Mud and I share a long history of camaraderie. I was prepared to give you zero points if you didn't do him justice...but you have.${prompt}
  13997: I just wish he was a little better at reading maps.${prompt}
  13998: Cid, can you help jog my memory? I can't properly recall how Black Mud dresses.${prompt}
  13999: Hahaha, me neither! In fact, who is Black Mud, anyway?${prompt}
  14000: And now for a few words from Black Mud himself!${prompt}
  14001: If you're ever on the lookout for rare materials from Tavnazia, Adoulin, and places beyond, be sure to visit me, and I'll place them on order for you. Black Mud, here for all your everyday needs!${prompt}
  14002: Um, you're not here for the free advertising. We're all waiting for your comments on ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] outfit.${prompt}
  14003: I don't know what this is all about, but if you're using my likeness, you need to pay the proper compensation--${prompt}
  14004: Yes, yes, thank you, Black Mud! Now go back to where you came from, to the rousing applause of our audience!${prompt}
  14005: Why, I didn't think it was possible for someone to recreate Michea so faithfully!${prompt}
  14006: Her wares have always impressed me with an inner warmth that can only come from someone who truly loves their craft, and you have brought that same warmth to your costume.${prompt}
  14007: As warm as your wonderful meals, Hilda.${prompt}
  14008: Oh, Oggbi, you're making me blush! Maybe I'll have to make you a little extra next time you stop by.${prompt}
  14009: I think you did a good job of emulating Michea. What do you think, Cid?${prompt}
  14010: Hmmm... A goldsmith, huh? I think maybe I should order my special someone a new ring...${prompt}
  14011: Dalzakk, if only you were here to see this... But I guess ${choice-player-gender}[he/she]'s just a contestant, not the real thing.${prompt}
  14012: Michea currently works as a goldsmith here in Bastok, but she originally hails from San d'Oria.${prompt}
  14013: Oh, maybe that's why I can't quite place the outfit.${prompt}
  14014: No, I think it's because the entire getup is all wrong.${prompt}
  14015: And finally, a few words from Michea herself!${prompt}
  14016: Of all the people you could have chosen, I'm humbled and honored that you chose me.${prompt}
  14017: This entire event has been such a joy, and it helped me to reaffirm that fashion is an important part of everyone's lives.${prompt}
  14018: But there is one thing that I don't understand.${prompt}
  14019: Why aren't you giving out points for accessories!? I'm a goldsmith, and I can say with confidence that accessories are the glue that holds an outfit together!${prompt}
  14020: The next time you hold this event, be sure to give them their proper due! I'll be happy to lend my expertise to the panel.${prompt}
  14021: Thank you, Michea, for that absolutely riveting--if rather out of place--tirade! We would expect nothing less from a Bastokan merchant!${prompt}
  14022: A big round of applause for Michea and our competitor!${prompt}
  14023: I'm quite impressed at how you've made Nbu Latteh really come to life!${prompt}
  14024: Yes, it's astounding. Perhaps it's because you share a bond as adventurers?${prompt}
  14025: Nbu Latteh is an adventurer? Really?${prompt}
  14026: In the flesh. She's as fast as a famished chocobo and never lets prey elude her.${prompt}
  14027: That's odd. I heard stories from the guards that...you know what? Forget I said anything.${prompt}
  14028: Hmmm. I certainly have seen worse...but I've also seen better.${prompt}
  14029: Yes, although we do appreciate the efforts you've put into replicating her one-of-a-kind charms.${prompt}
  14030: I'm not sure “charms” are what's lacking here...${prompt}
  14031: I'll tell you what's lacking--ale! I need more ale!${prompt}
  14032: Nbu Latteh is an adventurer who is often spotted in Bastok Mines. Ah, yes, doesn't she have a lovely daughter...?${prompt}
  14033: Not that we see her too much these days. I wonder what she's up to.${prompt}
  14034: Well, she is an adventurer. But I don't recall ever seeing her dressed in...that.${prompt}
  14035: Thank you for your assessment, judges. Normally we'd ask Nbu Latteh to come say a few words herself, but she's a bit tied up at the moment.${prompt}
  14036: So instead, we've got her fan club here to comment on her behalf!${prompt}
  14037: Ah, hello! I'm Roh Latteh, here on behalf of my mother.${prompt}
  14038: Oh, aren't you just the cutest thing! I could gobble you right up! Maybe I should trade my brother for you.${prompt}
  14039: '...That wouldn''t be so bad.${prompt}'
  14040: If I do a really good job, she said she'll give me some candy, so...I'll try my hardest!${prompt}
  14041: Oh, how precious and well-behaved you are! We might just have some cookies for you too!${prompt}
  14042: Baked fresh by Hilda herself! Why, I would even give my brother for one of those chewy delights!${prompt}
  14043: '...Again, that doesn''t sound half bad.${prompt}'
  14044: ${choice-player-gender}[Mr./Ms.] Adventurer...
  14045: Thanks for doing so well!${prompt}
  14046: That's all!${prompt}
  14047: That's right, everyone, looks like our cute little friend is done for now! A big round of applause!${prompt}
  14048: I was watching the whole time, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  14049: It must have been tough coming up with your outfit, but I think you did a great job.${prompt}
  14050: Brygid was pleased, too, so she's sure to help us get a really great disguise for Raebrimm.${prompt}
  14051: Thanks for participating today!${prompt}
  14052: We're still tallying up the judges' score, so hang on just a little while longer.${prompt}
  14053: Even those who didn't place highly will receive a token reward from Brygid herself, so be sure to connect with her soon.${prompt}
  14054: Take care!
