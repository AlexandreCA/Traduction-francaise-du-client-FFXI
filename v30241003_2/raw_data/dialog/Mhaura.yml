    Comme vous voulez.
    Mhaura est une ville portuaire située dans les frontières de la Fédération de Windurst.${prompt}
  6857: Le bassin naturel ici était idéal pour construire un port. Avec le temps, des gens ont commencé à bâtir leurs maisons dans les falaises environnantes. Ainsi est née Mhaura.${prompt}
  6858: Géographiquement, Mhaura se situe dans la moitié sud de la péninsule de Buburimu, dans le sud-est de Mindartia. La ville de Windurst est au sud-ouest d'ici.${prompt}
  6859: Depuis le port, vous pouvez embarquer sur l'un des navires de transit pour Selbina, une ville dans le centre de Quon.${prompt}
  6860: Dernièrement, il y a même des navires qui voyagent vers une ville appelée Al Zahbi dans l'Empire proche-oriental d'Aht Urhgan.${prompt}

    Thanks so much! Now I know who to ask when I need something!${prompt}
  6891: Ah...thanks, but when I saw you wouldn't make it, I asked someone else. Well, since you did bring them, though, I'll give you some gil for your efforts.${prompt}
  6892: 'Let me tell you something about cooking: a dish is only as good as its ingredients. The fresher they are, the better the food.${prompt}'
  6893: Just remember that next time, okay?${prompt}
  6894: |-
    Hey, long time no see.
    Remember the last order I got? That was from the governor herself, and she really liked the dish I made for her!${prompt}
  6895: She liked it so much, she said she wants me to prepare all her meals from now on!${prompt}
  6896: I don't want to disappoint her, so I need you to bring me exotic ingredients to practice my cooking skills!${prompt}
  6897: 'I heard they''re pretty hard to get, but I''d like to start with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Whaddaya say?${prompt}'

    Really? That's great!
    You can take your time with it, just as long as you bring me one. Good luck!${prompt}

  6900: 'Back so soon, eh? So, do you think you can find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} for me?${prompt}'
  6901: |-
    Wow! You got it!
    I have to say, I'm really impressed!${prompt}
  6902: Here's your well-deserved reward. Come back in two or three days if you can. I still have some work for you. ${prompt}
  6903: So, how's it going? Working hard or hardly working? Take it slow, though. There's no hurry.${prompt}
  6904: Rycharde is a good cook. I'm glad to hear you've been working hard to help him. Good luck to you both!${prompt}
  6905: |-
    There you are!
    I've managed to make a pretty good dish--if I may say so myself--with the ingredient you brought me last time.${prompt}
  6906: I know I've been giving you tough jobs so far, so this time I'm going to give you an easy one.${prompt}
  6907: All you have to do is take this dish to a man named Valgeir in Selbina. Whaddaya say?${prompt}
  6908: |-
    All right!
    Go to the port and board the transit ship to Selbina. Here, I'll pay for your travel fare in advance.${prompt}

    Oh...your reward, right. Here.
    I don't think I'll have any work for you for a while... Thanks for your help, though.${prompt}

    Oh...it's you.
    Sorry, I don't have any work for you. Give me some time to...recover.${prompt}
  6918: Hi, there. You've been working for Rycharde for a while now...do you know what's wrong with him lately? He looks down.${prompt}
  6919: |-
    What? He sent you to Valgeir?
    Let me guess: he refused to recognize Rycharde's talents again, right?${prompt}
  6920: Valgeir is Rycharde's father, and one of the best cooks in Vana'diel. He's also a very strict man, especially to his son.${prompt}
  6921: He raised Rycharde to be a great cook like him, but there were some things they could never agree on. In the end, Rycharde ended up leaving home.${prompt}
  6922: Rycharde has worked hard and become a very good cook. Valgeir really should give him some credit. Don't you agree?${prompt}
  6923: But you know what? I wouldn't mind tasting some of Valgeir's cooking someday. I wonder what it's like?${prompt}
  6924: You went and brought me some of Valgeir's cooking? Thank you! I'll have Rycharde taste some of it, too.${prompt}
  6925: And here, take these. It's the least I can do.${prompt}
  6926: Thank you for working so hard to help Rycharde. I promise I'll have him taste some of his father's cooking.${prompt}
  6927: |-
    Ah, you're back.
    Ms. Take told me. I want to thank you.${prompt}
  6928: As for the old man's cooking...it was incredible. I don't think I would ever be able to make anything like that.${prompt}
  6929: But I'm not trying to emulate him. I just want to make him acknowledge my way of cooking, you know? And I need your help to accomplish that.${prompt}
  6930: 'I''d like you to bring me four ${item-plural: 0[2]}. These, again, are hard to find.${prompt}'
  6931: |-
    No deadline. I'll wait until you bring back four of them.

    Here, take this, you earned it!
    All right! Now I'll show that old man!${prompt}
  6937: Thanks, but...this isn't enough. Could you come back when you find four of them? Good luck!${prompt}
  6938: Thanks for bringing some of Valgeir's cooking. It was delicious! I think tasting it really helped Rycharde.${prompt}
  6939: |-
    Hi! I was waiting for you to come.
    Rejoice! My new dish is done, and I have a job for you!${prompt}
  6940: |-
    I need you to take it to Valgeir again.
    Whaddaya say, will you do it?${prompt}
  6941: So, how was it? Did he say anything? Oh...you haven't gone yet. I'm sure this time he'll be surprised, so go quick!${prompt}
  6942: 'Hmm? He sent you back to give this to me? But it''s just ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}... What does it mean?${prompt}'
  6943: |-
    Anyway, here, this is your reward.
    Thanks again.${prompt}
  6944: |-
    Hi again. Thanks for last time!
    I finally got what that ${item-singular: 0[2]} meant!${prompt}
  6945: 'My old man used to make me practice on them when he was teaching me to cook. I would usually mess it up, and he would yell at me for wasting perfectly good ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  6946: For years, he kept yelling at me for every little mistake I made... So one day I left, promising myself I'd show him I could become a good cook without his help!${prompt}
  6947: 'But you know, when I was a kid, my mom used to make the best ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  6948: She wasn't trained like my old man, and she wasn't even using the best utensils...${prompt}
  6949: |-
    But Mom's ${item-plural: 1[2]} were the best!
    I loved them!${prompt}
  6950: That's what this reminded me of, and I realized I had forgotten the most important thing about cooking.${prompt}
  6951: I have to get back to the basics. But I'm glad you came along and helped me see my mistake. Thank you!${prompt}
  6952: Have you seen Rycharde lately? He seems changed. He has this look of determination I've never seen before.${prompt}
  6953: He must've rediscovered something deep inside...something he had long forgotten. I'm glad for him, and it's all thanks to you.${prompt}
  6954: What do you want? Yes, I'm Orlando the antiquary, but I don't deal with people who can't ride chocobos. That means you. Go away.${prompt}
  6955: |-
    Ah! You can ride chocobos, I see.
    I'm Orlando the antiquary. I have a proposal for you, if you're interested.${prompt}
  6956: Did you know that some of the Goblins around here hide items in the ground?${prompt}
  6957: Find those hiding spots and dig them up with a chocobo. If you're lucky, you might even find something valuable.${prompt}
  6958: But most of it will be junk. That's where I come in. Bring the junk to me and I'll buy them off you.${prompt}
  6959: I only buy items in bunches of eight, though, so only come if you have enough. Of course, the amount I'll pay depends on what you bring.${prompt}
  6960: |-
    Good hunting, then!
    But be careful. There are things worse than Goblins out there!${prompt}
  6961: 'Let''s see what you''ve brought... ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 1[2]}, eh? I''ll give you ${number: 0} gil for them. Come back when you''ve dug up some more!${prompt}'
  6962: Hmm? It seems like you can't carry anything else. Come back when you've lightened your load.${prompt}
  6963: This isn't enough. I told you, I only buy items in bunches of eight. Come back when you have enough, all right?${prompt}
  6964: |-
    So, how goes the hunt?
    Bring me eight of the same items and I'll buy them off you. I'll pay more if their quality is good. Good luck!${prompt}
  6965: People call me a “junk collector,” but they're just a bunch of ignoramuses. Only connoisseurs like me can appreciate the true value of what I have.${prompt}
  6966: |-
    Oh... Hello.
    I'm waiting for my husband. He's a sailor. I'll be fine. I'm used to waiting.${prompt}

  7012: C'est une histoire amusante, vraiment. Les gens qui travaillent ici m'ont dit que ce n'est pas pareil sans moi dans les parages.${prompt}
  7013: J'ai donc décidé de rester ici et de prier pour la sécurité de tous ceux qui gagnent leur vie en mer.${prompt}
  7014: Que la mer soit clémente avec ceux qui s'aventurent dans son domaine...${prompt} 
  7015: Eh ? Que voilà ? Un aventurier débutant ! Je n'ai rien à faire avec quelqu'un comme toi !${prompt}

    Je suis content que tu demandes.
    Tu vois, je fais de la poterie dans cette ville depuis aussi longtemps que je me souvienne... On m'appellerait un artisan.${prompt}

  7024: "Le problème, c’est qu’une bande de monstres semble avoir fait de ces mines leur maison, et les commerçants n’ont pas pu obtenir de ${item-plural: 0[2]}. ${prompt}"

  7026: "Alors... j’ai besoin d’un aventurier vaillant comme toi pour me rapporter ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. J’ai entendu dire qu’on peut en trouver au fond des mines.${prompt}"

    Hoh-hoh.
    Oui, c'est ce que j'avais demandé. Je suis prêt à parler maintenant.${prompt}

  7046: 'Hmm... tu sais, j''ai entendu dire que ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} est bon pour la mémoire.${prompt}'
  7047: Si tu m'en apportes, je pourrais me souvenir de ce que j'essayais de te dire. Veux-tu aller en chercher ?${prompt}
  7048: |-
    Merci.
    Je vais essayer de me souvenir par moi-même en attendant.${prompt}
  7049: |-
    C'est dommage pour toi.
    Je suis sûr que ce que j'allais te dire t'aurait beaucoup aidé. Es-tu sûr de ne pas vouloir y aller ?${prompt}
  7050: Ah ! Oui, c'est ça. Mais j'ai réussi à me souvenir sans ça. Hoh-hoh. Maintenant, écoute attentivement...${prompt}
  7051: As-tu déjà vu des gens utiliser des compétences venant de métiers autres que leur principal ? Ces personnes utilisent ce qu'on appelle des "métiers de soutien".${prompt}
  7052: Et si tu ne peux pas utiliser de métiers de soutien, tu ne mérites pas d'être appelé aventurier ! Mais je peux t'aider avec ça. Hoh-hoh.${prompt}
  7053: 'C''est à toi de voir, mais si tu veux que je t''enseigne... il faudra d''abord m''apporter ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7054: Hmm... Je vois que tu as de l'énergie, après tout. Tu pourrais bien devenir un vrai aventurier. Hoh-hoh. D'accord, je vais t'enseigner les métiers de soutien comme promis.${prompt}
  7055: Tu peux ajouter un métier de soutien à ton principal là où tu peux changer de métier. Bien sûr, ça doit être un métier que tu as déjà acquis.${prompt}
  7056: Mais quel que soit le métier que tu choisis comme soutien, son niveau effectif n'excédera jamais la moitié de celui de ton métier principal. Ton métier de soutien ne bénéficiera pas non plus des points d'expérience que tu gagnes. Après tout, il est conçu pour être complémentaire.${prompt}
  7057: 'Laisse-moi te donner un exemple : Supposons que tu aies atteint le niveau 20 en tant que guerrier et le niveau 10 en tant que mage blanc. Si tu choisis guerrier comme métier principal et mage blanc comme métier de soutien, voici ce qui se passera...${prompt}'
  7058: Ton niveau de guerrier reste le même à 20, et ton niveau effectif en mage blanc reste également à 10 - la moitié du niveau de ton métier principal. Dans ce cas, les deux métiers fonctionnent à leur plein potentiel dans leurs rôles.${prompt}
  7059: Maintenant, disons que tu choisis le même métier de mage blanc comme principal et que tu mets ton métier de guerrier en soutien...${prompt}
  7060: Ton niveau de mage blanc est toujours de 10, mais le niveau effectif de ton métier de guerrier chute à 5, la moitié du niveau de ton métier principal. Maintenant, c'est beaucoup de potentiel gâché, n'est-ce pas ? Hoh-hoh.${prompt}
  7061: Et choisir un métier avec un niveau inférieur à la moitié de ton métier principal comme soutien ne te sera pas très utile non plus. Assure-toi d'utiliser tes métiers à leur plein potentiel quand tu choisis des métiers de soutien.${prompt}
  7062: En ce qui concerne le métier le mieux adapté à ton métier principal... idéalement, ce devrait être un métier qui couvre les faiblesses de ton métier principal, ou qui renforce ses forces.${prompt}
  7063: |-
    ... Voilà à peu près tout.
    Tout est clair ?${prompt}
  7064: |-
    Comprends-tu comment fonctionnent les métiers de soutien ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Compris.
    Peux-tu repasser ça ?${prompt}
  7065: Bien. Alors pourquoi es-tu encore là ? Vas-y, essaie ! Et n'oublie pas de me remercier quand ça te sauvera la peau. Hoh-hoh.${prompt}
  7066: |-
    Oh, c'est encore toi.
    Tu devais penser que je te demandais de m'apporter ces choses par cupidité. Hoh-hoh.${prompt}
  7067: Mais tu réalises que je ne faisais que te tester pour voir si tu pouvais vraiment les obtenir. J'étais dans le Marché... Mooseket... Muskewhatchamacallits avant, tu sais ?${prompt}
  7068: Tu as l'air dubitatif. Je t'ai bien appris à utiliser des métiers de soutien, non ? Eh bien, tu es libre de croire ce que tu veux, mais ce que tu as maintenant, c'est un vrai pouvoir. Utilise-le sagement. Hoh-hoh.${prompt}
  7069: Tu peux maintenant utiliser des métiers de soutien !${prompt}
  7070: J'ai entendu dire une fois que la vieille Vera était une guerrière de renom quand elle était jeune. C'était avant mon époque, donc je ne sais pas si c'est vrai.${prompt}
  7071: Et à son âge, je dirais que quiconque pourrait attester de la véracité de cette rumeur serait depuis longtemps disparu.${prompt}

    La pêche est un art...
    Je n'ai rien à dire à quelqu'un qui n'a jamais tenu une canne à pêche de sa vie.${prompt}

  7158: Oh, je sais ! Tu parles des rangers ! Ma maman a dit que le ranger le plus célèbre est une Mithra, comme moi !${prompt}

    Bonjour, savais-tu ?
    On dit que les pirates d'autrefois ont caché un grand trésor dans une pièce quelque part dans le Labyrinthe de Shakrami.${prompt}
  7168: Les pirates de cette époque étaient très différents de ceux que nous avons maintenant, mais les pirates restent des pirates. Ils sont tous effrayants !${prompt}
  7169: Apparemment, les pirates déguisent leur navire pour qu'il ressemble à un ferry ! Tu devrais faire attention lorsque tu voyages par mer entre Mhaura et Selbina.${prompt}
  7170: Je me suis toujours demandé... où vivent les pirates ? Je veux dire, ils ne peuvent pas toujours vivre sur leur navire. Ils doivent avoir une base quelque part...${prompt}
  7171: La vieille femme qui est toujours debout devant l'entrepôt me donne la chair de poule, mais pour une raison quelconque, beaucoup de gens viennent la voir. Je me demande pourquoi ?${prompt}
  7172: Monsieur Orlando aime collectionner les choses les plus étranges ! Il ne peut pas en vouloir aux gens qui l'appellent un collectionneur de bric-à-brac !${prompt}
  7173: J'ai vu beaucoup d'aventuriers au look costaud venir à Mhaura pour voir Monsieur Nereus. Es-tu ici pour le voir aussi ?${prompt}
  7174: Bihoro-Guhoro ici dit qu'il sait tout sur les pirates... mais apparemment, il n'en a jamais rencontré. C'est marrant, non ?${prompt}

  7311: Perih Vashai était profondément troublée de savoir si elle devait renvoyer l'enfant dans la patrie.${prompt}
  7312: Une nuit, la cheftaine est venue me voir. Nous rapporterions à la patrie que la pécheresse et sa fille étaient mortes toutes les deux au Château Oztroja, tuées par les Yagudo.${prompt}

  7331: Pour sauver sa fille, la cheftaine Nhev Befrathi s'est précipitée vers le camp voisin de Perih Vashai et de ses guerriers d'élite.${prompt}
  7332: Pour la cheftaine, cet acte revenait à sauter directement dans la prison, mais c'était la seule option qui lui restait pour sauver sa fille.${prompt}
  7333: Après avoir entendu les paroles de Nhev Befrathi, Perih Vashai a immédiatement mené ses guerriers dans une raid contre le Château Oztroja, sans attendre l'aube.${prompt}
  7334: Le pouvoir de l'Arc de Lumière était incroyable à voir. Pourtant, de nombreux guerriers ont perdu la vie ce jour-là.${prompt}
  7335: Lorsque nous avons enfin échappé au château, il ne restait qu'une poignée de guerriers.${prompt}

  7456: |-
    Hello?
    You're an adventurer, right?
    Maybe you can help us out.${prompt}
  7457: Let me introduce myself and my companion. We're from the Rhinostery in Windurst.${prompt}
  7458: 'I was hired by the ministry to accompany this researcher to ${choice: 2}[Ifrit''s Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei''Yin/the Boyahda Tree] and assist her in her study of a series of giant crystals.${prompt}'

    Science is not about winning or spinning, life or strife, even or Steven! It's a more delicate subjectaru!${prompt}
  7463: Do you see what I have to deal with? I don't know how much longer I can work with such a pessimist.${prompt}
  7464: |-
    That's where you come in.
    I was thinking of letting one of you adventurers test out the new fork and prove to my colleague that it is able to return data valuable to her research.${prompt}
  7465: |-
    No no no no no!
    Even if they use that half-rate spork, it'll take a tip-top summoner to defeat the prime avatar!${prompt}
  7466: |-
    Listen up.
    The fandangled ${item-singular: 1[2]} won't make it any easier for you to downright defeat the monster inside the crystal. Sure, it'll lower the power of the prime avatar to around ${number: 3}, but it will do the same to you! And on top of that, you'll only be able to summon that itty-bitty blue bugger, Carbuncle!${prompt}
  7467: And to make things worse, nobody-buddy else can enter the crystal with you! You'll be battling one-on-one, man-to-man, Taru-et-Taru!${prompt}
  7468: |-
    ...
    Yes, but ma'am... The Rhinostery has been pressing us to produce results. If we do not take some sort of action quickly...${prompt}

    Hmmm...
    You do have a point there...
    I guess one round with a prime avatar wouldn't hurtaru.${prompt}
  7470: No, one round could not hurt.${prompt}

    Are you really-dilly sure?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fork me!
    On second thought...${prompt}
  7473: |-
    Well, you asked for it!
    Take this ${item-singular: 1[2]} and ring it near one of those giant crystals. The prime avatar won't be slap-happy to be woken up, and you'll have to deal with its wrath.${prompt}
  7474: 'I guess because you are helping us check out this new tuning fork, I can use my mighty-minty magic to warp you near the giant crystal in ${choice: 2}[Ifrit''s Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei''Yin/the Boyahda Tree].

  7555: Tu sais, ce sont ces poupées grandeur nature utilisées pour exposer des vêtements et des armures. J'ai entendu dire qu'il y a quelques années, on ne pouvait pas entrer dans une guilde ou une boutique de tailleur sans en croiser une. Elles étaient partout !${prompt}
  7556: Selon mon mentor, ce n'était pas seulement l'apparence d'un mannequin qui le distinguait des autres poupées, mais aussi l'artisanat des articulations qui maintenaient les parties ensemble.${prompt}
  7557: Apparemment, toutes les articulations étaient fabriquées par une seule maître orfèvre dont les compétences étaient en avance sur son temps. Grâce à son travail, les mannequins pouvaient être positionnés dans toutes les poses imaginables – ils étaient plus humains qu'un Hume !${prompt}
  7558: Que ce soit une armure rigide ou une tunique complexe, il n'y avait rien qui ne paraissait pas naturel sur ces œuvres d'art. Rien que penser à en fabriquer un moi-même fait battre mon cœur d'orfèvre plus vite.${prompt}
  7559: Cependant, comme tu peux le voir, il n'y a pas un mannequin à moins de cinq mille malms d'ici. Personne n'en fabrique et personne n'en utilise. Ce que je ne comprends pas, c'est pourquoi ils ont tous disparu...${prompt}

  7561: Hmm... J'ai déjà vérifié à la Guilde des Tisserands à Windurst et ils n'avaient plus de mannequins...${prompt}

  7584: Si possible, j'apprécierais que les cannes que tu ramènes soient cassées net en deux. Merci, l'ami(e) !${prompt}

    What? You'rrre still here?
    Okay, okay. To thank you for the magazine, here's what I'll do. For the low, low price of ${number: 4} gil, I'll change the pose of any of your mannequins to match these sketches.${prompt}
  7641: Huh? You want me to do it for frrree? Hey, a lady's got to make a living, you know!${prompt}
  7642: Oh, and while you'rrre here, why not buy one of my high-quality mannequins to add to your collection!?${prompt}
  7643: |-
    Hey!
    Wait up!${prompt}
  7644: |-
    Where's my sisterrr?
    Wasn't she with you!?${prompt}
  7645: Or did you hear that she was taking a ship home from here?${prompt}
  7646: |-
    You're such an innocent kitten.
    Why would a sin hunter's confidential activity be made public knowledge?${prompt}
  7647: If you're looking for Shikaree Z, she's talking to Koh Lenbalalako.${prompt}
  7648: |-
    Ah!
    Isn't that the perrrson Mother used to talk...${prompt}
  7649: Shikaree Z!${prompt}
  7650: |-
    Shikaree Y. Shikaree X.
    Keeping out of trouble, I trust?${prompt}
  7651: |-
    And ${name-player}.
    You've got a hunter's instincts to find me here.${prompt}
  7652: My sisters have told you that I am to return to the homeland?${prompt}
  7653: |-
    I'll be taking the ferry to a nearby port, then boarding a ship bound for Elshimo.
    This is probably the last time I'll see you.${prompt}
  7654: Huh. Who would've thought those words would be so hard to say?${prompt}
  7655: |-
    It must come as quite a relief to you, though. Like a rabbit that has eluded its pursuer.
    Am I right?${prompt}
  7656: |-
    Happy to see her go?
    ${selection-lines}
    Bon voyage!
    Going so soon?${prompt}
  7657: |-
    Your honesty is refreshing.
    Let our farewell be just as uncomplicated as your feelings.${prompt}
  7658: |-
    What an unusual ${choice: 0}[woman/man] you are.
    But let there be no loose ends with this farewell.${prompt}
  7659: I will try to keep this brief.${prompt}
  7660: After returning to our homeland, I will make a full report to the queen concerning Promathia, Altana, and the sins of their children.${prompt}
  7661: Citing the struggle of people against these sins, I will dispute the crimes of Mildaurion, Prishe, and the wyrms.${prompt}
  7662: |-
    Finally...
    I will renounce my name as a Mithran Tracker.${prompt}
  7663: Whoa!
  7664: What!?
  7665: I have thought long on the reason behind our deception at the hands of Mildaurion and Prishe.${prompt}
  7666: While traveling as their companion, they proved to me that there was no other recourse for their actions.${prompt}
  7667: Mildaurion and Prishe interfered with our investigation in order to prevent a greater crime from being committed.${prompt}
  7668: A Mithran Tracker hunts sin. It is our duty to seek out crimes and dole out punishment.${prompt}
  7669: |-
    But these crimes I hunt, against whom have they been perpetrated?
    For whose sake am I judging the criminal?${prompt}
  7670: As I pondered these questions, these words began repeating over and over in my mind.${prompt}
  7671: |-
    “The very act of hunting sin creates sin.
    To not hunt sin is also a choice...”${prompt}
  7672: But that was...${prompt}
  7673: '...What our mother used to...${prompt}'
  7674: This line of thought is anathema for any Mithran Tracker.${prompt}
  7675: Part of the reason I wished to battle Promathia was to silence the doubt in my heart.${prompt}
  7676: |-
    And then I felt it.
    The sense of justice within me.${prompt}
  7677: Even if I lose the title of Mithran Tracker, or rather because I will lose it, true justice will be possible.${prompt}
  7678: |-
    Words cannot explain it.
    It is something you must learn about yourself as you live and grow.${prompt}
  7679: |-
    Do not lament the fact that you have yet to learn this truth.
    I only wish for you to understand the path that I have chosen for myself.${prompt}
  7680: '...${prompt}'
  7681: '...${prompt}'
  7682: |-
    My journey with you has brought priceless experiences and valuable time to think.
    I have no words to express my gratitude, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7683: |-
    If you continue to battle the Emptiness, we may yet meet again.
    When we do, call me by my real name.${prompt}
  7684: |-
    Snap out of it, fuzz-for-brains.
    It's time to see our sister off.${prompt}
  7685: |-
    Yeah...
    After all, she's still our big sister.
    That will neverrr change.${prompt}
  7686: |-
    Exactly.
    We're not just hunters of sin.
    We're also guardians of those we love.${prompt}
  7687: |-
    Why, this brings back memorrries.
    The daughters of the Mithran Tracker I met twenty years ago have also chosen the life of the sin hunter.${prompt}
  7688: I pray that they, too, find the path of justice.${prompt}

  7733: |-
    You are an adventurer, are you not?
    My name is Wilhelm. I am a purchasing agent for the Brugaire Consortium.${prompt}
  7734: I have quite a bit of respect for you adventurers. I think it is marvelous that there are people in this world who are doing their best to help others.${prompt}
  7735: This is just a passing rumor, but I heard that several people have ventured to another world and encountered extraordinary beings...in a mysterious place, enveloped in light!${prompt}
  7736: It is quite a far-fetched tale, if I say so myself! It would seem that such an absurd story cannot be true, and asking if you have been to such a land would be utterly ludicrous...but still, I cannot hold back my curiosity, if indeed you have seen this ethereal land.${prompt}
  7737: |-
    Have you been to such a place?
    ${selection-lines}
    Been there, done that!
    Where again?${prompt}
  7738: I apologize for my forward behavior. If you ever do see such a place, you must return and tell me of the wonders that you find!${prompt}
  7739: |-
    By Altana! You are far more courageous than the average adventurer!
    Then tell me, have you seen the giant black beasts which do not seem to be living creatures, but machines with flesh and blood?${prompt}
  7740: Truth be told, I am currently on orders from a certain nation to seek out such a beast.${prompt}
  7741: I am not proposing anything so preposterous as attempting to capture the creature, however. I only require a fragment from one of the beasts. If you manage to get one, I would be most pleased if you brought it to me.${prompt}
  7742: But of course, I shall not simply take without giving something in return. Let this be known to no one, but we at the Brugaire Consortium recently came into the possession of extravagant armor and apparel from the Near East. I may be able to make some...special arrangements...if you lend your assistance.${prompt}
  7743: O illustrious adventurer, please accept my plea!${prompt}
  7744: 'I have heard that the black creatures reside in two places: at the top of an illuminated tower and at the bottom of a dark abyss. It also seems that there are two types: one that crawls on four legs and one that floats in the air. All I require is a segment from one of them. I implore you, please lend me your aid!${prompt}'
  7745: Th-this is undeniably a fragment of the legendary Ultima! Kamaal! You must see this, Kamaal!${prompt}
  7746: You fool! I only need to be called once. I do have ears!${prompt}
  7747: Show it to me.${prompt}

    Adventurer, you have my gratitude.

  7751: Rifaqat. Give this ${choice-player-gender}[gentleman his/lady her] reward. I think ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] will be most pleased.${prompt}
  7752: The most skilled clothcrafters in Aht Urhgan weaved this over a span of ten years. It is a gift of utmost quality...and I humbly present it to you.${prompt}
  7753: If you acquire any more segments of Ultima, I would greatly appreciate it if you could bring them to me.${prompt}
  7754: Another segment from Ultima! You have my utmost gratitude. Please accept this in return.${prompt}
  7755: Th-this is undeniably a fragment of the legendary Omega! Hadiyah! You must see this, Hadiyah!${prompt}
  7756: Insolent fool! Who gave you the right to speak my name? Have you no idea who I am? I am a blue mage! You must show proper respect around me!${prompt}
  7757: Hurry up and show me what you have, you blithering milksop!${prompt}

    May your name be praised, adventurer!
    With this, restoration of the light divinity shall proceed in leaps and bounds!${prompt}

  7762: Les armuriers les plus talentueux d'Aht Urhgan ont forgé ceci au cours de dix années. C'est un cadeau de la plus haute qualité... et je vous le présente humblement.${prompt}
  7763: Si vous acquérez d'autres segments d'Omega, je vous serais très reconnaissant de bien vouloir me les apporter.${prompt}
  7764: Un autre segment d'Omega ! Vous avez toute ma gratitude. Veuillez accepter ceci en retour.${prompt}
  7765: |-
    Oui... c'est indubitable.

    Où, je vous prie, l'avez-vous trouvé ?${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}

    C'est là que j'interviens, kupo.

  7788: Ce n’est pas que nous, les mogs, refuserions ce genre de don, kupo.${prompt}
  7789: |-
    Choisissez l'objet que vous souhaitez confier, puis échangez-le avec moi en ajoutant un seul bon de stockage.
    Je prendrai l'objet et vous rendrai le bon, marqué d'un sceau invisible.${prompt}
  7790: |-
    Invisible pour vous, en tout cas.
    C'est clair comme de l'eau de roche pour nous, les mogs, alors ne pensez même pas à nous rouler, kupo.${prompt}
  7791: Quand vous voudrez récupérer votre objet, échangez-moi simplement un bon de stockage, n'importe lequel, encore une fois.${prompt}
  7792: |-
    Je vous présenterai une liste de tous les objets actuellement sous ma garde, et vous pourrez choisir celui que vous souhaitez retirer.
    Aussi simple que ça, kupo !${prompt}
  7793: |-
    De plus, aucuns frais de transaction supplémentaires ne seront appliqués !
    Plutôt généreux de notre part, non ?${prompt}
  7794: |-
    Maintenant, je parie que vous vous demandez où est l'astuce, kupo.
    Pour ne pas vous décevoir, il y en a quelques-unes !${prompt}
  7795: Par exemple, tout objet signé perdra sa signature si vous le stockez chez moi.${prompt}
  7796: |-
    Pourquoi, demandez-vous ? Hé, même nous, les mogs, ne sommes pas parfaits !
    C'est mieux pour nous deux si vous gardez vos possessions les plus précieuses à portée de main, kupo.${prompt}
  7797: Maintenant, écoutez bien, car il y a une autre subtilité, et elle est de taille.${prompt}
  7798: |-
    Si vous perdez votre bon de stockage, je ne pourrai jamais vous rendre votre objet. Jamais. Pas de "et si" ou "mais" !
    Pas de "Je suis désolé, M. Mog porteur, ça n'arrivera plus jamais !"
    Les règles sont les règles, kupo, et il faut bien quelqu'un pour les faire respecter.${prompt}
  7799: Dernière chose, je ne peux accepter aucun équipement portant l'insigne des épreuves Magian.${prompt}
  7800: Si vous avez un tel objet que vous mourez d'envie de me confier, vous devrez d'abord abandonner votre épreuve, kupo.${prompt}

  8344: Mandragora Mania is a game in which you battle for jingly by moving your mandragora pieces to the goal.${prompt}
  8345: 'Your goal is the ${choice: 0}[red/blue/green] one on the right, while your opponent''s is the ${choice: 0}[blue/green/red] one on the left.${prompt}'
  8346: At the start of the game, three mandragoras each will be placed on the eight game areas, excluding the goal.${prompt}
  8347: There are five starting placements (A through E), and you are able to select which one you would like to employ. The default setting is "Random."${prompt}
  8348: This explanation uses pattern A, but the basic rules are the same regardless of the starting pattern.${prompt}
  8349: 'The three ${choice: 0}[red/blue/green] areas in front of you are yours,${wait-36: 2}the three ${choice: 0}[blue/green/red] areas at the back are your opponent''s,${wait-36: 2}and the remaining two are neutral.${prompt}'
  8350: You must choose one area--either yours or a neutral one--to proceed.${prompt}
  8351: The areas are numbered from one to five starting from the left, and any mandragoras in the area you select will move.${prompt}
  8352: Conversely, your opponent must select either a neutral area or an area that belongs to them.${prompt}
  8353: From the right, those areas are numbered 6, 4, 7, 2, and 8.${prompt}
  8354: 'For example, if you select Area 1,${wait-36: 4}one mandragora will move to Area 2${wait-36: 1}and one will move to Area 3,${wait-36: 1}and one will move to Area 4.${prompt}'
  8355: Note that the mandragoras will move from the back first--last in, first out.${prompt}
  8356: You will receive points known as “jingly” each time one of your mandragoras reaches the goal.${prompt}
  8357: You will enter your opponent's territory whenever you go past the goal.${prompt}
  8358: If one of your mandragoras happens to reach the opponent's goal, the goal will be pushed back and your mandragora will return to your own area. You don't have to worry about your mandragora earning any jingly for your opponent.${prompt}
  8359: The order in which players choose areas will be determined based on your turn settings. The default setting is random.${prompt}
  8360: This explanation has skipped past your opponent's turn for demonstration purposes, but in the actual game you and your opponent will take turns choosing areas.${prompt}
  8361: However, if the last mandragora to move reaches the goal, you will get to take an additional turn.${prompt}
  8362: Mandragoras are a very diverse species, and the amount of jingly you earn is determined by the species of mandragora that crosses into the goal.${prompt}
  8363: 'Adenium and citrullus: 3 jingly (first player)/4 jingly (second player).${prompt}'
