    Doctor Shantotto...
    I fully understand the concerns of Prince Trion, and believe he has a point.${prompt}
  6943: In a republic like Bastok, where a large portion of our army is made up of normal citizens, it is easy for morale levels to slide. This is a problem that is constantly being tackled by our officials.${prompt}
  6944: |-
    Really?
    Well, that's your nation. Windurst doesn't face such problems.${prompt}
  6945: Our Mithran Mercenaries enjoy being sent to far-off places. It gives them the opportunity to run and jump and hunt and roll around in the mud--whatever those feminine felines like to do in their free time.${prompt}
  6946: Maybe instead of buffing up your soldiers' muscles all day, you should try training their minds...like we do. And that's my two gil!${prompt}
  6947: |-
    Oh, rea～lly?
    Well, that's your nation.
    We don't have such problems in the Federation.${prompt}
  6948: "Our Mithran Mercenaries enjoy being sent to faraway places. \nIt gives them time to take their naps, hunt their mice, and go on their chases.${prompt}"

    Maybe it's to the lack of confidence that you can give thanks
    for the drastic fall of morale in your pathetic ranks.${prompt}

  6952: Yes, but hiring mercenaries can be quite the burden on the Federation's treasury, can it not?${prompt}
  6953: The more regions under your nation's control, the more mercenaries you must hire. And before you realize it, your vaults will be empty.${prompt}
  6954: I suspect that the conquest is taking its toll on the Federation.${prompt}
  6955: Well, we...${prompt}

    Like father, like son, I say.
    I would not trust a lump of rubbish made by one of you lunatics any more than I would trust one of you lunatics!${prompt}
  6968: How can one call a soldier that does not obey his leader a soldier? And how can one call a leader who cannot control his soldiers a leader?${prompt}
  6969: Ooh, somebody's in a bad mood...${prompt}
  6970: |-
    Prince Trion.
    You certainly did not bring up this issue without having a solution in mind.${prompt}
  6971: |-
    Exactly!
    You'd better have something interesting to say.
    Or Ajido and I will pack up our things and be on our way.${prompt}
  6972: Recently one of our Royal Knights made his return journey from our kingdom's territories to the north--Lord Excenmille.${prompt}
  6973: Excenmille? The man who, after the Great War, took a handful of soldiers and successfully invaded the Orcish Empire using guerilla tactics?${prompt}
  6974: |-
    Yes.
    Sword in hand, donning armor stained with the blood of a thousand foes, he returned to his homeland for the first time in twenty years...and was shocked at what he found lurking beyond its gates.${prompt}
  6975: Foreign merchants of all shapes and sizes peddling their trinkets. Scruffy adventurers shouting out their petty problems as they walked freely among the streets and alleys. Local shopkeeps and Temple Knights laughing as they mingled with the scum washed up from all corners of the continent.${prompt}
  6976: Excenmille was furious.${prompt}
  6977: Why would he be furious? The influx of adventurers has revitalized your nation.${prompt}
  6978: According to Excenmille, twenty-five years ago, a union among the children of Altana was necessary to defeat the armies of darkness.${prompt}
  6979: However, now that the threat has gone, there is no reason for San d'Oria's citizens to be brushing shoulders with the common folk of other nations. It is this symbiotic relationship that plagues the Kingdom and keeps the once mighty red lion shackled down.${prompt}
  6980: That seems like quite an anachronous opinion...${prompt}
  6981: Excenmille's way of thinking may seem out-of-date, but his logic cannot be denied. Ever since the opening of our gates to outsiders, the quality of our knights has fallen dramatically.${prompt}
  6982: |-
    ...
    I'm tired of hearing stories about some pumpkin-bumpkin knight.
    Are you going to get to the point, or are we going to be here all night?${prompt}

    Due to the extreme level of danger involved, it was banned well before the Great War.
    You are not suggesting that we reinstate Conflict, are you?${prompt}
  6989: That is what I propose.${prompt}
  6990: |-
    Conflict...
    An interesting idea...${prompt}
  6991: There was once a time when Conflict ignited the spirits of the people of Bastok--players and fans alike.${prompt}
  6992: However, after numerous “accidents,” the games were deemed a bad influence on the Republic's image, and were banned by law.${prompt}
  6993: If Conflict was reinstated, it could re-ignite the flames in the hearts of all Bastokers and renew their faith in the Republican Army. Morale would be restored, and our problems solved.${prompt}
  6994: |-

    About ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1}.

  7013: Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word “ballista” means “to throw a stone,” and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.${prompt}
  7014: |-
    The rules are simple.
    Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.${prompt}
  7015: 'Players from both teams must search for ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} that a ${color: 5}Herald${color: 1} has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  7016: 'These ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} into them.${prompt}'
  7017: Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.${prompt}
  7018: '${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the ${color: 5}Quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.${prompt}'
  7019: 'Sometimes a player may find items other than ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}, such as potions. These ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).${prompt}'
  7020: |-
    Players can carry more than one ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them.
    However, players will lose their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} if they:
    (1) Successfully throw them into a rook.
    (2) Leave the area.
    (3) Are knocked out.${prompt}
  7021: 'But don''t forget, a player will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command while in possession of a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. And, players can only use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command if they carry one of the stones.${prompt}'
  7022: As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.${prompt}
  7023: 'All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. This will temporarily increase one''s movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  7024: 'However, remember that once a player has obtained a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, he or she will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. In its place, though, one may use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command.${prompt}'
  7025: 'The locations of the ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.${prompt}'
  7026: 'Communication with one''s team members is, of course, one way to locate ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}. However, another way is by using the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  7027: 'Finally, ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} can only be used when a player is carrying a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. Because ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.${prompt}'
  7028: 'So, a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} has been obtained and a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1} located. Now all that''s left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.${prompt}'
  7029: There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.${prompt}
  7030: 'To throw a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} into a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}, a player must first wait until the ${color: 5}Rook''s${color: 1} gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.${prompt}'
  7031: |-
    But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status.
    Only then will his or her shots count.${prompt}
  7032: This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.${prompt}
  7033: Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.${prompt}
  7034: |-
    The following match types are area-specific:
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands
    Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains${prompt}
  7035: |-
    ${color: 5}Best of Three${color: 1} series rules are as follows:
    Winning a match will earn a nation one “match point.” The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for “come-from-behind” victories.${prompt}
  7036: Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.${prompt}
  7037: Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.${prompt}
  7038: When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.${prompt}
  7039: For more information on temporary items, refer to the “special rules.”${prompt}
  7040: After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.${prompt}
  7041: If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.${prompt}
  7042: |-
    Please note that many of the rules previously considered “special” have been fully implemented.
    Also, several new special rules have been added.${prompt}

  7044: 'Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} for use at any time during the match.${prompt}'
  7045: 'Players can hold up to ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1}, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.${prompt}'
  7046: 'If players who possess ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.${prompt}'
  7047: Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.${prompt}
  7048: 'Finally, the Heralds will collect ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.${prompt}'
  7049: 'Ballista Points are rewarded to each competitor based on his or her performance in a single Ballista match. The maximum number of points that can be accumulated per match is ${number: 0}.${prompt}'
  7050: 'While it is taken into consideration, scoring ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} is not the only way to earn Ballista Points. Assisting allies and defeating members of the enemy forces can also earn a high score.${prompt}'
  7051: 'Ballista Points can be traded for special “vouchers,” which may be exchanged for free ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} at the start of new matches.${prompt}'
  7052: |-
    However, remember that depending on the level restriction of the match, certain vouchers will not be redeemed at the beginning of a match.
    Speak with a ${color: 5}Marshal${color: 1} directly after a match to register your points.${prompt}
  7053: 'Players will only be allowed to score up to five ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} at a time. Also, a player''s ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status will be automatically disengaged if a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} is not scored within a certain amount of time. The amount of time is increased for those members of the team currently behind in points.${prompt}'
  7054: 'All allies within a certain radius will achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status when a member of the enemy forces is defeated.${prompt}'
  7055: Players' resistance to sleep will be increased.${prompt}
  7056: 'During the entry period, from ${number: 0}:${number-2-digits: 1}, all adventurers will be allowed to join the forces with the smallest number of participants, regardless of allegiance. Open entries will be accepted until both sides have reached maximum capacity.${prompt}'
  7057: |-
    In order to ensure balanced matches, the following level limits are enforced:
    Level 30 matches: 1～30${prompt}
  7058: |-
    Level 40 matches: 31～40
    Level 50 matches: 41～50
    Level 60 matches: 51～60
    Unrestricted matches: 61～${prompt}
  7059: Please note that any participant who cancels his or her registration will not be allowed to re-apply for the same match.${prompt}
  7060: When the total number of participants in a match is less than 40, the location of the two camps will be adjusted. Also in this case, the number of Rooks will be reduced to two.${prompt}
  7061: Any adventurer whose main level is over 30 will receive EXP for participating in a Ballista match. However, no EXP will be rewarded if the adventurer fails to actively take part in the match.${prompt}

    Quoi ? Ne me dis pas que tu as des doutes maintenant!${prompt}

    Écoute bien !
    Je m'appelle Invincible Bouclier, Légat de la troisième division de la Légion Républicaine.${prompt}
  7170: Le président lui-même m'a nommé Commandant du Conflit et a mis les forces bastokiennes sous mon contrôle. Si tu joins, tu serviras sous moi et uniquement sous moi !${prompt}

    Quoi !? Tu as des questions sur le Conflit !?
    Je ne me souviens pas que quelqu'un t'ait donné la permission de poser des questions, soldat !${prompt}
  7172: |-
    Je vais laisser passer cette fois, mais ça ne doit pas se reproduire !
    Maintenant, écoute bien !${prompt}
  7173: |-
    As-tu compris ce que je viens de te dire !?
    Participer au Conflit est un honneur et un privilège !${prompt}

    Tu veux être un héros !? Eh bien, voici ta chance, soldat !
    Signe ce formulaire de demande et tu pourras y aller !${prompt}
  7175: |-
    Plus de temps !?
    Et je pensais que tu étais plus qu'un pleurnichard !
    La République n'a pas besoin de plus de faiblards comme toi !
    Tu es renvoyé !${prompt}
  7176: Tu as enfin réalisé ta dette envers le Royaume et décidé de la rembourser par le service dans le Conflit ?${prompt}
  7177: Eh bien, regarde qui est de retour. Je savais que tu ne pouvais pas résister à l'excitation du Conflit. Tu es prêt à t'inscrire, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7178: |-
    Je vois que tu as enfin retrouvé tes esprits, soldat !
    Maintenant, signe cette demande et tu pourras y aller !${prompt}
  7179: |-
    Excellent.
    Cependant, il y a une dernière tâche que je dois te demander d'accomplir avant d'approuver ta demande.${prompt}
  7180: Voyage à Bastok et Windurst et rencontre leurs dirigeants. Tu n'as pas à t'inquiéter des détails. Ils savent déjà que tu viendras.${prompt}
  7181: Je souhaite également que tu délivres ces lettres aux Commandants du Conflit des deux nations.${prompt}
  7182: Un Galka élevé, Ginu... Bouclier Invincible, t'attendra à Bastok.${prompt}
  7183: Et je me souviens que le Commandant des forces de Windurst était une Mithra nommée Mhabi... quelque chose. J'ai du mal à me souvenir des noms étrangers.${prompt}
  7184: |-
    C'est tout. Tu peux partir immédiatement.
    Je dois dire que je suis assez honoré d'envoyer un si bon aventurier que toi pour représenter le Royaume.${prompt}
  7185: |-
    Merveilleux !
    Je sais que tu es prêt à sortir et à commencer à te battre tout de suite, mais avant de le faire, tu auras besoin d'une licence.${prompt}
  7186: Pour obtenir une licence, tu devras rencontrer les dirigeants des deux autres nations.${prompt}
  7187: Et--tu pensais que c'était tout ?--tu devras apporter ces lettres aux Commandants du Conflit de San d'Oria et de Bastok.${prompt}
  7188: Je ne sais pas grand-chose sur les deux, mais le Commandant de Bastok est un type qui a mille ans et qui s'appelle Bouclier Invincible. Je pense me souvenir que celui de San d'Oria est un Elvaan froid nommé Excenmille.${prompt}
  7189: Maintenant, dépêche-toi ! Plus vite tu finiras ça, plus vite tu pourras échanger des coups avec ces idiots des autres nations !${prompt}
  7190: |-
    Heh heh heh...
    Quand ils verront qui je leur ai envoyé, ils trembleront dans leurs grèves !${prompt}
  7191: |-
    Tu as fait le bon choix, soldat !
    À partir d'aujourd'hui, tu es un membre officiel des forces de Conflit de Bastok !${prompt}
  7192: |-
    Maintenant écoute bien, car je vais te donner tes premiers ordres, et je ne vais les répéter qu'une seule fois !
    Tu dois infiltrer les villes ennemies et rencontrer leurs dirigeants !${prompt}
  7193: |-
    Quoi !?
    Qui sont les ennemis ? Où as-tu été pendant les vingt-cinq dernières années, à vivre dans un trou !?
    Les ennemis sont les Elvaan et les Tarutaru !${prompt}

    Après avoir rencontré leurs dirigeants, tu dois livrer ces correspondances aux Commandants du Conflit de ces nations !
    Ne t'inquiète pas, tu n'auras aucun mal à trouver ces lâches de seconde zone !${prompt}
  7195: |-
    Cherche Excenmille à San d'Oria et Mhabi à Windurst !
    Rien que le son de leurs noms me donne envie de vomir !${prompt}

    Tu as tes ordres, maintenant fais tes préparatifs finaux et mets-toi en route ! Tu as dix, non, huit minutes !
    Reparti !!!${prompt}
  7197: Quelque chose ne va pas ? Tu dois rencontrer les dirigeants de Bastok et Windurst.${prompt}
  7198: De plus, donne les lettres que je t'ai remises aux Commandants du Conflit Bouclier Invincible et Mhabi... quelque chose.${prompt}
  7199: Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ? Dépêche-toi et rencontre les dirigeants de Bastok et de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7200: Oh, et n'oublie pas de donner mes lettres à Bouclier Invincible et Excenmille.${prompt}
  7201: Ne me dis même pas que tu as oublié tes ordres ! J'ai rencontré des vers de tunnel avec une meilleure mémoire que toi !${prompt}
  7202: |-
    Maintenant écoute bien, soldat !
    Après avoir rencontré les dirigeants de San d'Oria et de Windurst, tu devras livrer les correspondances que je t'ai remises aux Commandants du Conflit Excenmille et Mhabi Molkot !
    Et je ne veux pas revoir ta face pathétique tant que tu n'as pas accompli ta mission ! Reparti !!!${prompt}
  7203: |-
    Content de te revoir après ton voyage.
    ……A ha ha ha ! Donc le vieux Ginuva n’était pas ravi du contenu de ma lettre. Je peux juste imaginer la tête qu’il a dû faire après l’avoir lue.${prompt}
  7204: |-
    Bien joué, ${name-player}.
    Maintenant, il ne te reste plus qu’à prêter serment devant le royaulais. Rends-toi immédiatement au château. Nous ne voudrions pas faire attendre Son Altesse.${prompt}
  7205: |-
    Heureux de te revoir ! Je commençais à craindre que tu te sois perdu !
    …Hé hé hé ! Ces deux bouffons ont été vexés par mes lettres ? Hah hah ! Merci, ${name-player}. Tu viens d’illuminer ma journée.${prompt}
  7206: Maintenant, il ne te reste plus qu’à parler à la petite Kupipi là-bas et à lui faire contacter la Sibylle Étoile. Quand tu auras fini, tu pourras me raconter ton voyage plus en détail.${prompt}
  7207: |-
    Bien joué, soldat !
    Je peux voir à ton expression que ces deux mauviettes de Windurst et San d’Oria n’ont pas apprécié les lettres que je t’ai fait livrer. Eh bien, tant pis pour eux !${prompt}
  7208: |-
    Si un chef ne peut pas garder son calme dans une situation tendue, il le paiera avec la vie de ses hommes !
    Garde ça en tête, soldat !${prompt}
  7209: |-
    Maintenant, file au Bureau du Président ! Sans la permission de notre chef, tu n’es rien d’autre qu’un chien galeux en uniforme !
    Dépêche-toi !${prompt}
  7210: 'Je te félicite, ${name-player}. Tu as bien accompli les tâches que je t’ai confiées. Tu feras un bon soldat. Maintenant, permets-moi de te présenter ta ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7211: Cette licence te permet de participer à l’exercice de combat traditionnel de San d’Oria, connu sous le nom de Ballista.${prompt}
  7212: Puisque ce sport trouve ses origines dans notre royaume, rien d’autre que la victoire ne sera toléré.${prompt}
  7213: |-
    Ah, j’avais presque oublié.
    Pour l’instant, la réinstauration du Conflit n’est que temporaire. Beaucoup de choses ont changé depuis qu’il a été instauré pour la première fois, il y a des années.${prompt}
  7214: |-
    Pour cette raison, il est très probable que de nombreuses règles actuelles soient modifiées, voire que tout le système soit définitivement interdit. Si tu as des avis sur les jeux, je te suggère de les exprimer.
    C’est tout.${prompt}
  7215: 'OK ! C’est terminé. Voici ta ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} !${prompt}'
  7216: 'Avec cette licence, tu pourras participer à l’un des anciens événements de Conflit de San d’Oria : Ballista. J’aurais préféré quelque chose de plus excitant – plus mithra – mais je suppose que ça ira pour l’instant.${prompt}'
  7217: Et peu importe le jeu, le meilleur l’emportera toujours, donc nous n’avons rien à craindre ! N’est-ce pas, ${name-player} ?${prompt}
  7218: |-
    Oh oui, j’avais presque oublié…
    La réinstauration du Conflit n’est toujours pas totalement officielle. Je ne sais pas ce qui préoccupe ces politiciens, mais c’est sans doute pour ça que je n’en suis pas un.${prompt}
  7219: Ils ont parlé de changer les règles si les joueurs n’étaient pas satisfaits des actuelles. Alors, fais entendre ta voix si tu veux qu’on t’écoute !${prompt}
  7220: |-
    Bien joué, soldat !
    J’attends le meilleur, et je donne le meilleur ! Prends cette ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} !${prompt}
  7221: La Licence de Ballista t’autorise à participer à l’exercice de combat de San d’Oria portant ce même nom.${prompt}
  7222: Nous devons affronter l’ennemi avec notre sang, notre courage, nos vies mêmes, pour prouver au monde que les forces de la République sont inébranlables !${prompt}
  7223: N’oublie pas non plus que les règles du Conflit peuvent changer sans préavis !${prompt}
  7224: |-
    "Bien que je ne trouve pas ça très malin, l’IRNC a décidé d’écouter les opinions de vous, aventuriers, pour améliorer Ballista. Moi, je dis : si tu ne supportes pas la chaleur, reste hors de la cuisine !
    Allez, file !${prompt}  "
  7225: J’ai avec moi une édition révisée du livre des règles de Ballista. Écoute bien…${prompt}
  7226: |-
    Très bien, soldat, tends l’oreille !
    Répète après moi les règles suivantes !${prompt}
  7227: Même si je ne suis pas vraiment du genre à suivre les règles, je suppose qu’il est bon que l’un de nous les connaisse…${prompt}
  7228: Une démonstration exquise de force, ${name-player} !${prompt}
  7229: C’était comme regarder une bataille menée par le Roi Dragon en personne !${prompt}
  7230: Excellent travail, ${name-player} !${prompt}
  7231: Les esquives et les coups, les assauts et les frappes. Je n’aurais pas fait mieux moi-même !${prompt}
  7232: |-
    Excellent travail, soldat ! Le président était ravi d’apprendre notre victoire !
    Mais ne crois pas que l’ennemi acceptera sa défaite sans broncher. Ils reviendront, et ils gagneront si tu ne les arrêtes pas !${prompt}
  7233: |-
    Maintenant, retourne au combat, soldat !
    Veux-tu vivre pour toujours ?!${prompt}

  7248: |-
    Un match nul !
    Un match nul est pire qu'une défaite, soldat ! Cela signifie que les deux forces n'avaient pas ce qu'il fallait pour être des gagnants !${prompt}

  7276: |-
    ???
    Si tu ne l'as pas remarqué, ce n'est pas San d'Oria. Si tu veux t'inscrire au Conflit, je te conseille de retourner à Ronfaure.${prompt}

    Est-ce que ça ressemble à Windurst, larva !?
    Si tu ne quittes pas ces lieux dans dix secondes, je serai enclin à utiliser la force !
    Bouge ! Bouge ! Bouge !${prompt}
  7278: |-
    Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
    Je n'ai aucun intérêt à discuter avec un membre de la République. Si tu ne pars pas immédiatement, je serai contraint d'appeler les Chevaliers du Temple et de te faire arrêter pour impiété envers la couronne !${prompt}
  7279: |-
    Tu parles de moi ?
    Tu parles de moi ?
    Eh bien, tu peux continuer à parler, mais ne pense pas que je vais écouter. Je n'ai rien à voir avec un Bastoker.${prompt}

    Qu'est-ce que c'est que cette odeur !?
    Pourquoi, c'est un aventurier de San d'Orian !

    Ah, je vois que tu as réussi à obtenir ta licence...
    J'ai hâte de te voir sur le champ de bataille.${prompt}

    Où as-tu trouvé cette licence, soldat !? Il est interdit par la loi de l'IRNC de posséder la documentation d'un autre soldat !
    Quoi !? C'est ta licence !? Ha ! Ha ! Ha !${prompt}
  7284: Ah, donc tu postules pour participer au Conflit ?${prompt}
  7285: |-
    Tu peux te rendre au château et rencontrer le Roi Destin. Le royaulais est dans ses appartements.
    Cependant, si j'entends parler de quelque chose de fou, je te décapiterai personnellement et présenterai ton crâne aux Hérauts pour être utilisé dans Ballista.${prompt}
  7286: |-
    Attends, ne me dis pas...
    Tu postules pour participer au Conflit !?
    (Hah ! Encore quelques joueurs comme ça et Windurst est garanti de gagner !)${prompt}
  7287: |-
    Oh, I'm sorry, did you hearrr that?
    Well, never mind. You see that cute Tarutaru, Kupipi, over there? You just talk to her and she'll take you to the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  7288: |-
    So this is the type of garbage the other two nations are enlisting!?
    It makes me sick to see San d'Oria and Windurst not take these exercises seriously!${prompt}
  7289: I wouldn't think that the president would give scum like you approval to participate in the Conflict, but your appointment has already been made. Now move it!${prompt}
  7290: What is that? A letter from that rat, Ginuva? Hand it over!${prompt}
  7291: |-
    .........
    How dare he even think of mentioning the Second Battle of Konschtat!${prompt}
  7292: |-
    You!

    Grrrrrr! The nerrrve of that Galka... Did he think that after sending such a letter, I'd send you back to your nation in anything less than a body bag!?${prompt}
  7295: Hm? You had no idea of what was in the letter? Well, then you take this message back to your precious Broken Shield--tell that old bloke that I'll show him the quickest path to rrreincarnation!${prompt}

  7303: |-
    .........
    Grrrrrr! What does he mean, amateurrr!? Ballista's a game, and I was the best! Battle experrrience has nothing to do with anything!${prompt}

    I have just received word that ${choice: 0}[you were awarded a chevron of excellence/you were the high scorer in San d'Oria's last match].${prompt}
  7309: I knew from the moment that I laid eyes on you that you would not let the Kingdom down; I just did not expect that it would be so soon. I salute you!${prompt}
  7310: I just received the news, ${name-player}! It seems like you did an outstanding job at tearing up the battlefield during the last Ballista match.${prompt}
  7311: I applaud you on your skill! Maybe it's time I challenged you to a little one-on-one...${prompt}
  7312: 'Well, if it isn''t the pond scum I found floating on my toilet this morning... What is this? You mean to tell me that you ${choice: 0}[were awarded some fancy chevron!?/were the top scorer at the last Ballista match!?] I... I...${prompt}'

    What are you looking at, soldier!? Haven't you seen anyone with dust in their eye!?
    Just because by some fluke you had a fine day on the Ballista field doesn't mean squat!
    Now get back out there, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7314: |-
    Welcome to the Bastokan Institute for Synergistic Research.
    I am Hildolf, chairman and lead researcher.${prompt}
  7315: |-
    And you... You must be another young ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] drawn here by the pungent but oh-so-sweet smell of science.
    An aspiring synergist! Am I right?${prompt}
  7316: |-
    Learn about synergy?
    ${selection-lines}
    Not now.
    Of course!${prompt}
  7317: |-
    Excellent! Your intellectual curiosity will serve you well as you embark on the path of science.
    Ours is a young discipline, with its greatest discoveries and breakthroughs yet to come, but I shall share with you the fruits of our research thus far.${prompt}
  7318: |-
    I see. I suppose the path of science is not for everyone.
    Should you ever find your curiosity piqued, the doors of our laboratory are always open.${prompt}
  7319: |-
    Let us start from square one. What is synergy?
    Why, synergy is synthesis taken to the nth degree!
    Synergists wield the powers of multiple elements, bringing them together in perfect balance to realize heretofore unimagined possibilities!${prompt}
  7320: |-
    And this is what makes synergy possible: the synergy furnace!
    Isn't she a beauty?${prompt}
  7321: Just pop open the top, toss in your materials along with your fewell--that's what we call the stuff that powers the thing--spin some wheels and pull some levers, and...voila! Prepare to be amazed by what comes out!${prompt}
  7322: |-
    ...In theory, at least.
    Our research is still in the early stages, and the recipes that we've managed to confirm are, as yet, few and far between.${prompt}
  7323: |-
    There are other complicating factors as well.
    Ingenious invention though it may be, the synergy furnace is yet but a prototype, and remains--how shall I say it--a bit unstable.${prompt}
  7324: |-
    As such, it is imperative that the operator exercise utmost caution to maintain the proper elemental balance at all times.
    In other words, fewell must be added in proper proportions, but with the contents of the furnace in a constant state of flux, this is no small task.${prompt}
  7325: |-
    Failure to maintain equilibrium may result in explosions, implosions, spontaneous combustions, or other unexpected and unpleasant results.
    Make no mistake: synergy is not a science for the faint of heart.${prompt}
  7326: |-
    Fortunately, there is good news.
    The synergy furnace, you see, is designed to allow for manipulation by multiple operators at once.${prompt}
  7327: Combine your knowledge and skill with that of your colleagues, master the process of maintaining equilibrium, and there is simply no limit to the wonders you may materialize. Truly a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts!${prompt}
  7328: |-
    So what do you say?
    Think you're ready to give the synergy furnace a spin for yourself?${prompt}
  7329: |-
    Become a synergist?
    ${selection-lines}
    Maybe another time.
    Sign me up!${prompt}
  7330: |-
    Oh, it's you again.
    Don't tell me--your curiosity has gotten the better of you, hasn't it?${prompt}
  7331: |-
    Wonderful! Another test subj--er, budding synergist!
    First, we'll be needing to set you up with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  7332: |-
    A what, you say?
    Put simply, it's a receptacle to hold your materials and fewell, designed to be used in conjunction with the communal synergy furnaces stationed about town.${prompt}
  7333: |-
    I would be happy to put one together for you, provided you furnish me with the components necessary for its construction.
    Let me see here...${prompt}
  7334: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}...${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and...
    Yes, yes...${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. That should be all we need.${prompt}
  7335: |-
    The ${item-singular: 0[2]} and the ${item-singular: 1[2]} can be acquired in abundance from the worms that inhabit Gustaberg.
    For the ${item-singular: 2[2]}, an expedition to the Palborough Mines might be in order.${prompt}
  7336: |-
    If you're acquainted with a good goldsmith, the ${item-singular: 3[2]} shouldn't be a problem.
    If not, there's always the auction house.${prompt}
  7337: All you need to do is trade these components to me, and prepare to enter the exciting world of synergy!${prompt}
  7338: |-
    What? You've forgotten which materials you need?
    Tsk tsk. Ah well, you wouldn't be the first absent-minded synergist.
    Now listen carefully this time...${prompt}
  7339: |-
    Stupendous! Can hardly wait to kick-start your career as a synergist, I see.
    Well, who am I to keep you waiting any longer?${prompt}
  7340: |-
    And there you have it! Your very own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, designed to be compatible with any synergy furnace.
    And as an added bonus to commemorate the birth of a new synergist, your first fill-up of fewell is on the house!${prompt}
  7341: |-
    My only regret is that I haven't the time to personally educate a promising young synergist like you on all the intricacies of our field.
    You should seek out the synergy engineers stationed throughout town. They're always eager to share their knowledge with new colleagues.${prompt}
  7342: |-
    Ah, yes. After you've honed your skills a bit, you should stop by the Alchemists' Guild.
    I haven't had the time to look into it myself, but word has it that their new invention has the synergistic community abuzz.${prompt}
  7343: |-
    Now, if you'll forgive me, my research calls.
    May your career in synergy be a fruitful one!${prompt}
  7344: |-
    Would that I had the time to discuss my latest discoveries with a fellow synergist!
    Sadly, I cannot afford even a second away from my experiments...${prompt}
  7345: ${prompt}
  7346: |-
    Well, well...if it isn't my prize pupil!
    That sparkle in your eyes tells me that you are well on your way down the path toward scientific enlightenment.${prompt}
  7347: |-
    Should you ever find your fewell stores running low, remember that it is a painless enough process to synthesize yourself some more.
    You need only prepare the corresponding crystal and rock, together with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  7348: '...The catch being that the procedure demands a certain degree of alchemical aptitude.${prompt}'
  7349: If you are in immediate need of fewell, I could provide you with a supply from my stock.${prompt}
  7350: |-
    Don't mention it, friend!
    After all, cooperation among synergists will only serve to further the advancement of our fair science.${prompt}
  7351: |-
    Obtain fewell?
    ${selection-lines}
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 1[2]}.

    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 6[2]}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 7[2]}.
    Perhaps another time.${prompt}
  7352: |-
    You require more time to ponder your decision, yes?
    A common plight of the prudent synergist, as I know all too well.${prompt}
  7353: 'It is ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you seek, yes?${prompt}'
  7354: |-
    Accept fewell?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  7355: |-
    It is my pleasure to provide you with ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.
    May ${choice-plurality: 1}[it/they] serve you well!${prompt}
  7356: |-
    Greetings, and welcome to the Bastokan Institute for Synergistic Research!
    I am Hildolf, chairman and lead researcher.${prompt}
  7357: |-
    While I would like nothing more than to expound on the wonders of synergy, I fear my experiments demand my undivided attention.
    I would encourage you to speak with one of our engineers stationed throughout town should you wish to learn more about our science.${prompt}
  7358: |-
    Ah, always a pleasure to encounter a fellow synergist!
    I see you've been keeping your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} in fine fettle.${prompt}
  7359: Do you perchance find your fewell tanks running low after synergizing up a storm?${prompt}
  7360: In my capacity as a pedagogue of the synergistic arts, it is my firm belief that my pupils learn best from solving their problems by their own devices.${prompt}
  7361: |-
    That said, I would sooner see you in front of a furnace than fretting endlessly over a depleted fewell supply.
    Hence my offer.${prompt}
  7362: |-
    Bring to me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and I will gladly synthesize whichever variety of fewell you desire.
    What say you to my offer?${prompt}
  7363: |-
    What say you?
    ${selection-lines}
    By all means!
    Not today.${prompt}
  7364: |-
    So your fewell stock is sufficiently full?
    All the better, then.${prompt}
  7365: |-
    Then, if you will excuse me, I must return to my research.
    May your synergistic pursuits lead you to knowledge and enlightenment!${prompt}
  7366: |-
    Welcome back, my pupil.
    Do you find yourself in need of fewell today?${prompt}
  7367: |-
    Very well.
    Bring to me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and I will gladly synthesize whichever variety of fewell you desire.${prompt}
  7368: 'Bring to me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and I will gladly synthesize whichever variety of fewell you desire.${prompt}'
  7369: 'Yes, this is certainly ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. There can be no mistaking it.${prompt}'
  7370: |-
    As promised, I shall synthesize for you the fewell you desire.
    What shall it be?${prompt}
  7371: |-
    Very well! Now step back and gaze upon Professor Hildolf's Synthesis 101.
    This will be on the test, so you may want to take notes.${prompt}
  7372: '${color-alt: 121}Hildolf synthesized ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}!'
  7373: |-
    Now that's some smooth synthesizing, if I do say so myself!
    And since my laboratory is already overflowing with fewell, why don't you take it all?${prompt}
  7374: Hm? Running low on fewell again, you say?${prompt}
  7375: |-
    I sympathize, but as my research affords me no time to help you today.
    Remember, the true synergist is ever resourceful. I leave you to your own devices.${prompt}
  7376: Of course I'm Cid. Who's asking? You certainly don't look like one of the adventurers I sent out on a mission...${prompt}
  7377: Oh? A memo for me?${prompt}
  7378: '${color-alt: 15}You hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.'
  7379: It's from...Midras. Of course, Junior!${prompt}
  7380: Let me get a look at that.${prompt}
  7381: What's that fool prattling on about now? Always a bit big for his britches.${prompt}
  7382: Hey, Raibaht! Bring me some of that 28-4.${prompt}
  7383: Idiot. Lucky for him we have the waypoints now, or he'd be completely up the creek.${prompt}
  7384: It was explosive powder you needed, yes? Sorry that my son made you come do his dirty work for him.${prompt}
  7385: Speaking of which, if he sent you here that means you came all the way from Adoulin.${prompt}
  7386: At least you didn't have to travel by boat. Those waypoints are innovation I can get behind. It's almost fearsome how much more advanced Adoulin is.${prompt}
  7387: <Sigh> I've got a lot left to learn.${prompt}
  7388: Raibaht, I've told you a thousand times--if you brought the thing, don't just stand there, say something!${prompt}
  7389: You never change, do you? <Sigh> Anyway, back to Junior.${prompt}
  7390: Here. This is what he's looking for.${prompt}
  7391: Oh, before I forget--how is the boy, anyway? He say anything?${prompt}
  7392: Chief, if you are concerned for the boy's well-being, you should just say so.${prompt}
  7393: Quiet, you! Stop butting in and get back to work!${prompt}
  7394: Yes, sir.${prompt}
  7395: You say he's keeping himself busy helping Amchuchu with her crop research, eh?${prompt}
  7396: That's good to hear! Energy and persistence conquer all things.${prompt}
  7397: Huh? Do I have any message for him?${prompt}
  7398: Hmm...he seems to be doing well enough for himself. Words of encouragement from his old man would probably just embarrass him.${prompt}
  7399: Come to think of it, if you run across Amchuchu, tell her thanks for looking after my boy.${prompt}
  7400: Well, don't let me keep you any longer. Junior's waiting.${prompt}
  7401: Cid, please, calm down.${prompt}
  7402: Who is it now!?${prompt}
  7403: ${name-player}! I'm in no mood for lollygagging, so out with it!
  7404: A letter from Amchuchu?${prompt}
  7405: I don't even have to open the damn thing to know what it's about. I've heard all about my good-for-nothing son!${prompt}
  7406: He's dead to me now!${prompt}
  7407: I've expelled him from my tutelage!${prompt}
  7408: Tell your precious Amchuchu that there's no need to look after that fool any longer.${prompt}
  7409: Chew on that!${prompt}
  7410: Now get the hell outta here!${prompt}
  7411: Before you arrived, someone from the Tenshodo paid us a visit, asking for Cid. He's been like that ever since.${prompt}
  7412: I don't know all the details, but I'll hang on to that letter just in case.${prompt}
  7413: '${color-alt: 15}You hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.'
  7414: Let's talk outside.${prompt}
  7415: Hmmm... What made Midras want to become an engineer?${prompt}
  7416: The only person who can answer that properly is Midras himself. Ah, but wait.${prompt}
  7417: I remember now. Back when he was still a boy, no older than ten. He got in a fight with one of the other children.${prompt}
  7418: The other child had a father who was seriously injured in the mining accident, and he took it all out on Midras. “If it weren't for your father's rotten powder, that explosion never would have happened!” or something like that.${prompt}
  7419: Midras was dumbfounded, and came to me for the truth. Sadly, it's not easy to lie to a child.${prompt}
  7420: He didn't say anything after that, but now that I think of it, that might have been the day.${prompt}
  7421: Ever since then, he would always be reading the explosives manual Cid gave him and would sometimes come to me with questions on mixtures and component ratios.${prompt}
  7422: That's about all I can remember, though. Hard to say if that's really what made him take up the hammer.${prompt}
  7423: What? You want to know where the accident happened?${prompt}
  7424: Listen, it's been over twenty years now. I don't go there anymore--none of us do, but I won't stop you if you're serious.${prompt}
  7425: It was in Palborough Mines. Take the elevator up to the third floor. The explosion happened down the unfinished shaft around G-8. I'll never forget that shaft.${prompt}
  7426: It's been ages, though. I wouldn't get your hopes up of finding anything down there.${prompt}
  7427: The accident happened in Palborough Mines. Take the elevator up to the third floor and head to the unfinished shaft around G-8.${prompt}
  7428: You're back. Not so loud.${prompt}
  7429: Hrmmm... You know who knows the right explosive mixtures for the bedrock in Palborough better than anyone?${prompt}
  7430: That's right. Midras.${prompt}
  7431: I don't know if he'd be willing to help, but he's the one you need to talk to.${prompt}
  7432: That kid would always be hanging around the port docks when something was on his mind. If they have docks over in Adoulin, I'm guessing that's where he'd be.${prompt}
  7433: I've got to get back to work now.
  7434: Talk to Midras. He'll know which explosives you need.${prompt}
  7435: Wh-what!? You say you...saw them?${prompt}
  7436: '${color-alt: 15}You hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.'
  7437: This...${prompt}
  7438: This was Sirius's ring.${prompt}
  7439: Sirius...founder of the Steaming Sheep, husband to Hilda...and a good friend.${prompt}
  7440: And this... This is Almid's locket.${prompt}
  7441: Almid, father of Midras. His real father.${prompt}
  7442: Gah...Gahahahaha!!!${prompt}
  7443: Pathetic! And here I was all this time feeling useless, while they were waiting for me the whole time in there!${prompt}
  7444: If only I could have done something...anything. At the time of the accident, we all felt that way, but there was nothing to be done but clear the rubble and bury the bodies.${prompt}
  7445: Hey, Raibaht! Come in here and give me a hand!${prompt}
  7446: At times like this, you're better off laughing!${prompt}
  7447: Yeesh! What's with that racket? If you don't quit that, I might just start calling you “Loud Mountain” or something!${prompt}
  7448: Of course, Chief. You may call me whatever you wish!${prompt}
  7449: Hey, listen. Don't tell Cid about any of this. It's better if he doesn't know.${prompt}
  7450: Hurry and take that locket to Midras. He should have it.${prompt}
  7451: Hopefully it will help him understand his real father.${prompt}
  7452: I will take the ring to Hilda. It's hers now.${prompt}
  7453: Hey, Raibaht! You got ears on your head!?${prompt}
  7454: Yes, Chief. I have ears.
  7455: 'Well, then. I think I''ll finish early today and go out for a big plate...of ${item-plural: 0[2]}.'
  7456: 'Obtained key item: ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.'
  7457: What can I do for you?${prompt}
  7458: |-
    Voici la Guilde des Forgerons de Bastok.
    Ici, c'est du sérieux--celle de San d'Oria n'a même pas la moitié de ce que nous avons !${prompt}
  7459: |-
    Ici, c'est la Salle de la Poudre.
    Tout ce qui s'y trouve est le fruit du dur labeur du chef.${prompt}
  7460: La Salle de la Poudre devait elle aussi devenir une guilde, mais l'accident a tout changé...${prompt}
  7461: Vous croyez qu'on a le temps de bavarder avec chaque aventurier qui passe par ici ?${prompt}
  7462: |-
    Bonne chance pour votre mission.
    Les Bastokiens aiment faire les choses dans les règles, alors évitez les ennuis et suivez leurs consignes.${prompt}
  7463: |-
    Vous avez réussi votre mission.
    Félicitations, et continuez ainsi.${prompt}
  7464: Présentez votre lettre d'introduction si vous avez des affaires au consulat. Sinon, veuillez quitter les lieux.${prompt}
  7465: |-
    Vous avez une lettre d'introduction ?
    Bien. Veuillez aller parler au consul.${prompt}
  7466: Bonne chance. Je prie pour le succès de votre mission.${prompt}
  7467: Il doit y avoir de nombreuses missions encore à accomplir à San d'Oria. Je prie aussi pour votre réussite dans celles-ci.${prompt}
  7468: |-
    Les Bastokiens n'ont aucun sens du style !
    Je ne comprends pas comment on peut vivre dans un endroit si morne.
    Oh, comme j'aimerais être de retour à San d'Oria !${prompt}
  7469: |-
    Oh, vous avez une lettre d'introduction.
    Alors, retournez là-bas et parlez au consul.${prompt}
  7470: |-
    On m'a dit qu'ils vous ont donné une tâche à accomplir.
    Mais que peuvent-ils bien attendre de vous dans ce coin reculé ?${prompt}
  7471: |-
    Oh, vous êtes de retour.
    Je vous envie. Vous n'êtes pas coincé ici comme moi... vous pouvez toujours retourner à San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7472: Les nations sans histoire, comme Bastok, manquent de tradition et d'élégance. Notre chère San d'Oria, en revanche, est le parfait exemple de style ordonné.${prompt}
  7473: |-
    Ah, vous avez une lettre d'introduction !
    Vite, vous devez parler au consul, au fond.${prompt}
  7474: |-
    Portez-vous bien, aventurier.
    Ce serait une honte de perdre quelqu’un comme vous dans un endroit pareil, si loin de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7475: Je suis heureux de voir que vous êtes sain et sauf. Vous ne devriez pas vous attarder dans un endroit comme celui-ci. San d'Oria vous attend, mon ami. Allez-y tant que vous le pouvez !${prompt}
  7476: |-
    Oui, je suis le consul de Windurst--mais ce n'est qu'une sinécure.
    Personne ne voulait de ce poste, et je ne les blâme pas.${prompt}
  7477: |-
    Bonne chance pour votre mission !
    Ici, les gens respectent les règles, alors faites-en autant, sinon on aura des problèmes !${prompt}
  7478: |-
    Bon travail !
    Oh, et dites aux gens de Windurst et aux autres consuls que je leur passe le bonjour quand vous y retournerez.${prompt}
  7479: |-
    Oui, ici, c'est le consulat de Windurst.
    Windurst... ah, chère Windurst, comme je languis de toi...${prompt}
  7480: |-
    Une lettre d'introduction ?
    Vous venez de Windurst ! Dites-moi, comment ça va là-bas !?${prompt}
  7481: |-
    Oh, vous cherchez des missions...
    Alors, veuillez parler au consul Patt-Pott...
    Ah, Windurst, comme je languis de toi...${prompt}
  7482: |-
    Vous allez là où se trouvent tous ces monstres, n'est-ce pas ?
    J'aimerais être de retour à Windurst... c'était si paisible là-bas.${prompt}
  7483: |-
    Vous êtes revenu.
    Alors vous retournez à Windurst ? Oh, comme je vous envie...${prompt}
  7484: |-
    Oh, bonjour ! Bienvenue au consulat de Windurst.
    Ah, mais nous ne pouvons rien faire pour vous si vous n'avez pas de lettre d'introduction...${prompt}
  7485: |-
    Oh ! Vous avez une lettre d'introduction !
    Le consul voudra vous voir.
    Il est au fond--entrez donc.${prompt}
  7486: |-
    Oh, vous allez combattre et tout, n'est-ce pas ?
    Soyez prudent !${prompt}
  7487: |-
    Oh ! Heureux de vous revoir !
    Vous retournez à Windurst maintenant ?
    Dites à tout le monde là-bas que nous allons bien !${prompt}
  7488: |-
    Bonjour... ?
    Oui, ici, c'est le consulat de Windurst.${prompt}
  7489: |-
    Une lettre d'introduction... ?
    Allez parler au consul, là-bas.${prompt}
  7490: |-
    Vous partez combattre... ?
    Bonne chance.${prompt}
  7491: |-
    Votre mission est terminée... ?
    Faites un bon retour à Windurst.${prompt}
  7492: |-
    Un aventurier, au consulat de Jeuno ?
    Vous n'avez rien à faire ici.${prompt}
  7493: |-
    Vous êtes au consulat de Jeuno.
    Nous ne pouvons rien faire pour vous à moins que vous ne soyez citoyen de Jeuno.${prompt}
  7494: |-
    Ici, c'est le consulat de Jeuno.
    Nous ne pouvons rien faire pour vous, à moins que vous ne soyez de Jeuno.${prompt}
  7495: |-
    Ici, c'est le consulat de Jeuno.
    Nous ne pouvons rien faire pour vous si vous n'avez pas la citoyenneté de Jeuno.${prompt}
  7496: |-
    Je suis désolé, mais je suis un peu occupé en ce moment.
    Pourriez-vous revenir plus tard ?${prompt}
  7497: |-
    Ici, c'est le bureau de l’assistant du président.
    Sir Lucius est très occupé pour le moment--essayez de ne pas le déranger, s’il vous plaît.${prompt}
  7498: |-
    Oui, que voulez-vous avec le Département de l'Industrie ?
    Nous sommes très occupés, vous savez. Mais nous ne le serions pas si le grand patron n’était pas un amateur ignorant.${prompt}
  7499: |-
    Ici, c'est le Département de l'Industrie.
    L’industrie est le moteur de notre nation, donc notre département gère essentiellement tout Bastok.${prompt}
  7500: Les bons sénateurs comme moi prennent le temps d'écouter les plaintes du peuple, contrairement à notre jeune président incompétent.${prompt}
  7501: Heh-heh-heh. Vous êtes très aimable, votre seigneurie. Vous nous avez tant donné... Heh-heh.${prompt}
  7502: |-
    Je dois augmenter la production des Forges métalliques avant la fin de mon mandat ici.
    Je devrais commencer par augmenter les quotas quotidiens de tout le monde...${prompt}
  7503: Ces gestionnaires qu’ils nous envoient sont tous les mêmes. Ils nous font faire tout le travail, et ils en prennent tout le mérite.${prompt}
  7504: |-
    Avez-vous vu les grandes roues à eau là-haut !?
    Elles sont incroyables ! Elles alimentent toutes les Forges métalliques, vous savez ?${prompt}
  7505: |-
    Tsk, tsk !
    Les ingénieurs de nos jours dépendent trop des machines !
    Dans mon temps...${prompt}
  7506: |-
    Ka-chink ! Ka-chink !
    J’adore le son des marteaux frappant le métal !
    Je trouve que c'est même mieux que les chansons que jouent les bardes !${prompt}
  7507: Avez-vous déjà rencontré une fille pleine d'énergie portant une grande écharpe ? C'est la fille du président, vous savez. Non, je ne plaisante pas! J'ai aussi entendu dire qu'ils s'entendaient bien avant qu'il n'occupe son poste actuel.${prompt}
  7508: Oh là là, j'ai besoin d'une pause...${prompt}
  7509: J'ai faim... non, en fait, je meurs de faim.${prompt}
  7510: La nourriture ici n'est pas mauvaise, mais un peu plus de variété ne ferait pas de mal, vous voyez ce que je veux dire ?${prompt}
  7511: |-
    Mon ami, Offa, m'a dit que les ${item-plural: 7[2]} sont exquis !
    J'aimerais bien en avoir un jour.${prompt}
  7512: Il m'a dit qu'il y avait un moyen simple mais dangereux d'en fabriquer, mais--hé, en parlant d'Offa, il ne vient plus travailler ces derniers temps...${prompt}
  7513: Hmm, il traîne probablement encore chez lui, dans le quartier des marchés.${prompt}
  7514: |-
    Hé ! C'est ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} ?
    Laisse-moi l'avoir ! Tiens, je te donne ceci en échange !${prompt}
  7515: |-
    Que ce soit la mine, la forge, ou l'aventure, c'est toujours pareil.
    Nous, les Galka, faisons tout le sale boulot pendant que les Humes restent assis et regardent.${prompt}
  7516: Ceci est le bureau du président.${prompt}
  7517: N'avez-vous pas des missions à accomplir ? Sinon, allez en prendre une et arrêtez de me déranger.${prompt}
  7518: |-
    Désolé, gamin, je suis un peu occupé en ce moment.
    Reviens plus tard, d'accord ?${prompt}
  7519: |-
    Ah, c'est vous.
    Vous vous souvenez de ce que je vous ai demandé de faire, non ?${prompt}
  7520: |-
    Ne dérangez pas le chef.
    Chaque seconde qu’il passe loin de sa recherche est une perte pour les Forges métalliques.${prompt}
  7521: |-
    Ceci est le bureau du président.
    N'entrez pas à moins d'avoir affaire officielle.${prompt}
  7522: |-
    Comment vas-tu, aventurier ?
    Souviens-toi, l'expérience est le meilleur enseignant.${prompt}
  7523: Ces canons ne sont plus que des symboles maintenant, et c'est ainsi que cela devrait être.${prompt}
  7524: |-
    Ces portes mènent au bureau du président.
    Seuls ceux en mission spéciale et les aventuriers de haut rang de Bastok peuvent entrer.${prompt}
  7525: |-
    Ici, c'est la Batterie Sud.
    Nous pouvons contrôler tous les canons de Bastok depuis cet endroit.
    Espérons que nous n'en aurons pas besoin de sitôt.${prompt}
  7526: |-
    Hé, tu n'es pas un enfant. Pourquoi fais-tu la chasse aux tampons ?
    Non, ne me dis pas, je ne veux pas savoir. Tiens.${prompt}
  7527: Tu as reçu un tampon !${prompt}
  7528: |-
    Cette alcôve est notre Temple de la Déesse.
    Peu de gens viennent ici -- les Bastokiens ne sont pas connus pour leur piété.${prompt}
  7529: La chasse aux timbres ? Je me permets de m'opposer à ce que des gens foulent ce lieu sacré, mais... allons, finissons-en.${prompt}
  7530: |-
    Cette zone est interdite aux... oh, tu as apporté le rapport des Mines de Zeruhn.
    Je vais le prendre.${prompt}
  7531: |-
    C'était ta première mission, n'est-ce pas ? Bon travail.
    Normalement, nous--${prompt}
  7532: Monsieur Lucius ! Comment puis-je vous aider ?${prompt}
  7533: Naji... tu as mentionné un rapport ?${prompt}
  7534: |-
    Oui, monsieur ! Cet aventurier vient d'apporter le dernier.
    J'allais tous vous les apporter plus tard, monsieur.${prompt}
  7535: Montre-le moi.${prompt}
  7536: Alors... de plus en plus de Galka commencent à croire au retour de leur Gardien des Récits.${prompt}
  7537: |-
    Le Gardien des Récits, monsieur ?
    Mais je pensais que ce n'était qu'un mythe galka, monsieur.${prompt}
  7538: Si seulement c'était vrai... J'ai reçu des rapports indiquant que le Gardien des Récits est déjà de retour parmi eux.${prompt}
  7539: "Ces rapports... continuez de me les apporter, Naji.\nNous ne voudrions pas déranger le président pour de telles futilités.${prompt} "
  7540: Oui, monsieur !${prompt}
  7541: Quant à toi, je sais que tu n'es pas à Bastok depuis longtemps, alors je vais te donner un conseil.${prompt}
  7542: |-
    Il n'est ni coutumier ni poli d'ouvrir des documents scellés avant leur livraison.
    Souviens-toi de cela si tu souhaites rester à Bastok.${prompt}
  7543: "Quant à toi, aventurier, tu as bien fait.\nBastok a besoin de plus de gens comme toi.${prompt} "
  7544: Waouh ! Peu de gens ont l'occasion de parler à Sir Lucius après leur première mission. Il doit voir quelque chose en toi. Continue ton bon travail !${prompt}
  7545: |-
    Ouais, qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
    Je suis un peu occupé en ce moment.${prompt}
  7546: |-
    Hmm ? Ouais, moi c'est Cid.
    Oh, tu es là pour la mission !
    D'accord, je t'attendais.${prompt}
  7547: Hé, Raibaht ! Apporte le machin ici.${prompt}
  7548: |-
    C'est seulement ta deuxième mission, hein ?
    La plupart des jeunes à Bastok n'ont pas le cran de partir à l'aventure, alors je compte sur toi. Fais de ton mieux, d'accord ?${prompt}
  7549: |-
    Bon, cette mission n'est pas si difficile.
    Tu dois juste sortir...${prompt}
  7550: '...Raibaht, mon vieux, si tu as apporté le truc, ne reste pas planté là, dis quelque chose !${prompt}'
  7551: '...J’ai apporté le truc.${prompt}'
  7552: |-
    Gah !
    Si tu continues comme ça, je vais commencer à t'appeler "Montagne Silencieuse" ou quelque chose du genre !${prompt}
  7553: |-
    Vous ne le feriez pas, chef. Vous n'êtes pas comme les autres.
    C'est pourquoi je travaille pour vous.${prompt}
  7554: |-
    Pff...
    Je l'aime bien -- il travaille dur, il est minutieux dans ses recherches et tout -- mais s'il pouvait juste être un peu plus bavard, tu vois ?${prompt}
  7555: 'Bref, voilà ce que je veux que tu fasses. Apporte ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} au Dangruf Wadi près de Gustaberg Sud.${prompt}'
  7556: |-
    Essaie de trouver un endroit dans le Wadi où ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} change de couleur.
    C'est tout.${prompt}
  7557: À quoi ça sert ? Eh bien, pour que tu comprennes, il faudrait que je te donne des cours sur les schémas d'accumulation des sédiments dans le Wadi et la formation de poches de gaz dans le sol...${prompt}
  7558: |-
    ...Je vois que tu fais une tête vide. Je sais, je sais, tu n'es pas devenu aventurier pour étudier la géologie, n'est-ce pas ?
    Ne t'inquiète pas, il n'y a rien de dangereux, alors vas-y !${prompt}
  7559: |-
    Ah, te voilà de retour !
    Voyons ça. Hmm... rouge, comme je le pensais.
    Et une réaction très forte aussi.${prompt}
  7560: Alors, nous devrions être en mesure de l'utiliser... mais nous devons nous assurer de minimiser les répercussions écologiques de ce travail...${prompt}
  7561: Toujours occupé, Chef ?${prompt}
  7562: |-
    Volker, vieux renard !
    Quand es-tu revenu ?${prompt}
  7563: Je viens de revenir, monsieur. J'avais des affaires dans les Forges aujourd'hui, alors j'ai pensé faire un saut.${prompt}
  7564: |-
    Tu dois avoir de belles histoires à raconter !
    Allez, dis-les nous !${prompt}
  7565: Chef, ne parlais-tu pas à cette personne avant que je n'interrompe ?${prompt}
  7566: |-
    Oh, c'est vrai ! Désolé.
    Cela fait longtemps que lui et moi n'avons pas eu l'occasion de parler.${prompt}
  7567: |-
    Laisse-moi me présenter.
    Je suis Volker, capitaine des Mousquetaires de Mythril.${prompt}
  7568: |-
    Tu dois être un aventurier... et nouveau à Bastok aussi, n'est-ce pas ?
    J'espère que tu te feras bien. Bastok a besoin de bonnes personnes.${prompt}
  7569: |-
    Oui, pour ta deuxième mission, tu t'es très bien débrouillé.
    Je vais le dire moi-même à la garde au poste.${prompt}
  7570: |-
    Eh bien, je devrais y aller.
    Je repasserai plus tard, Chef.${prompt}
  7571: Je dois aller prêter une oreille aux doléances du président encore une fois.${prompt}
  7572: |-
    Allez, il a besoin de soutien, surtout de ta part.
    Ça ne ressemble peut-être pas à grand-chose, mais je suis sûr qu'il fait de son mieux.${prompt}
  7573: |-
    Je suis désolé de t'avoir retenu si longtemps. Merci encore, et bon travail.
    Oh, et il se peut que j'aie encore besoin de ton aide bientôt, alors reste en contact !${prompt}
  7574: 'Ah, on t''a assigné à enquêter sur les ${item-plural: 7[2]} ?${prompt}'
  7575: Il y a de nombreux phénomènes étranges associés à cet endroit, comme tu l'as entendu.${prompt}
  7576: J'ai scanné cette zone et j'ai trouvé qu'il y a une forte résonance cristalline sur une ligne droite entre cette structure et Jeuno.${prompt}
  7577: Pour l'instant, je l'appelle la “Ligne Cristalline”...${prompt}
  7578: Ne t'inquiète pas, tu es en train de prendre cette expression vide sur ton visage à nouveau. Je vais passer les détails.${prompt}
  7579: |-
    Il y a trois endroits près de la structure où tu peux obtenir des ${item-plural: 7[2]}.
    Ce sont des plateformes brillantes et surélevées appelées "Télépoints".${prompt}
  7580: |-
    Place un cristal sur un Télépoint, et le cristal sera drainé de son pouvoir.
    Fais cela et rapporte-moi le cristal fané.${prompt}
  7581: |-
    Oh, une chose de plus.
    Pour mettre le cristal sur un Télépoint, utilise "Échanger".${prompt}
  7582: |-
    Bien, tu as rapporté ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.
    Comme je le pensais, son schéma de détérioration est presque identique à celui trouvé à Beadeaux...${prompt}
  7583: |-
    <Soupir>
    Je ne sais vraiment pas quoi penser de toutes les étranges occurrences qui se produisent ces derniers temps...${prompt}
  7584: Je me demande si cela a quelque chose à voir avec le Télépoint brisé que nous avons découvert récemment...${prompt}
  7585: Je me demande si cela a quelque chose à voir avec les Télépoints brisés...${prompt}
  7586: |-
    Hm ? Oh, désolé. Je parlais juste à moi-même.
    Bon travail. Tu peux...attends, puis-je te demander de faire quelque chose d'autre pour moi ?${prompt}
  7587: Te souviens-tu de Volker ? Il est venu ici quand tu me rapportais les résultats de ta première mission.${prompt}
  7588: Il serait préférable que tu puisses le lui remettre en personne, mais c'est un homme occupé et difficile à trouver.${prompt}
  7589: Remets-le à l'un de ses Mousquetaires de Mythril à la place. Ayame et Naji devraient être en garde près du bureau du Président. L'un ou l'autre fera l'affaire.${prompt}
  7590: |-
    Une lettre du Chef ?
    De quoi s'agit-il ?${prompt}
  7591: |-
    Elle est adressée à notre capitaine.
    Voyons voir... Hmm ? Hein ? Je n'y comprends rien...${prompt}
  7592: |-
    Je suis désolé, mais pourrais-tu la donner à Ayame à la place ? Elle devrait être en garde à l'arrière de ce bâtiment.
    Ce genre de trucs techniques, c'est plus son domaine. Pour moi, c'est du charabia.${prompt}
  7593: Oh, mais fais-moi une faveur... Ne lui dis pas que je t'ai demandé ça, sinon elle va encore se moquer de moi.${prompt}
  7594: |-
    Tu as une lettre du Chef Ingénieur ?
    Puis-je la voir ?${prompt}
  7595: |-
    C'est un rapport sur l'enquête de la Ligne de Cristal.
    Il est adressé à notre capitaine... Cela pourrait signifier que notre compagnie part bientôt.${prompt}
  7596: |-
    Merci de m'avoir apporté ça.
    Ta présence est très appréciée. Le Chef est un peu occupé ces jours-ci pour faire ce genre de tâches lui-même.${prompt}
  7597: |-
    Je dois te poser une question, cependant.
    Pourquoi m'as-tu apporté ça, et pas à Naji ?
    Lui aussi est un Mousquetaire de Mythril et est posté plus près de l'entrée.${prompt}
  7598: |-
    Pourquoi as-tu donné la lettre à Ayame ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Naji n'avait pas l'air assez intelligent.
    Ayame avait l'air plus fiable.
    Parce que j'en avais envie.${prompt}
  7599: |-
    Hah hah hah.
    Eh bien, il dit toujours : “Je suis un combattant, pas un penseur !”
    Pour ce qui est de la deuxième partie, je dois peut-être être d'accord.${prompt}
  7600: Merci pour le compliment. Les Mythril Mousquetaires sont censés être fiables, mais je n'étais pas sûr de pouvoir jouer ce rôle. Eh bien, au moins je fais un peu plus que Naji.${prompt}
  7601: |-
    Tu es très perspicace ; j'apprécie cela chez un aventurier.
    Je suppose que je vais te voir beaucoup plus souvent.${prompt}
  7602: |-
    Oh. Eh bien, peu importe.
    Bon travail.${prompt}
  7603: |-
    Oooh ! Tu m'as apporté ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} !
    J'adore ces cuits--${prompt}
  7604: |-
    Euh... je veux dire, c'est très important pour la sécurité de Bastok, oui !
    Il est impératif que tu ne dises à personne que tu m'as apporté ça !${prompt}
  7605: |-
    Tu as prouvé que tu es un grand patriote !
    Je suivrai ta carrière avec grand intérêt.${prompt}
  7606: Sénateur, monsieur... vous n'avez toujours pas remis vos ordres concernant--${prompt}
  7607: |-
    Iron Eater ! Qu-que fais-tu ici !?
    Je suis en plein milieu d'une affaire très importante--${prompt}
  7608: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 7[2]} encore, monsieur ?${prompt}'
  7609: |-
    Comment le sais-tu ? Euh... je veux dire, sors d'ici !
    Ça va se gâter si je ne le cuisine pas--${prompt}
  7610: |-
    <Sigh> Bon appétit, monsieur.
    Remets simplement les papiers à un des Mousquetaires dès que tu as fini.${prompt}
  7611: Dis-moi... ne te demandes-tu pas parfois si ces missions valent vraiment ton temps ?${prompt}
  7612: |-
    Penses-tu que les missions sont une perte de temps ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui, je le pense.
    Non, je ne le pense pas.${prompt}
  7613: |-
    Hah hah hah.
    Tu es honnête. Mais ce n'est pas quelque chose que tu devrais dire à un Mousquetaire de Mythril, surtout quand tu es près du bureau du Président.${prompt}
  7614: |-
    Je vois.
    Je dois m'excuser. Ce n'est pas digne d'un Mousquetaire de Mythril de poser de telles questions.${prompt}
  7615: Quoi qu'il en soit, il ne fait aucun doute que tu as fait beaucoup pour la prospérité de Bastok, et que tu le feras à l'avenir aussi.${prompt}
  7616: Je dois essayer de faire de même...${prompt}
  7617: |-
    Content de te revoir.
    J'ai entendu dire que tu allais à l'étranger.${prompt}
  7618: D'habitude, c'est moi qui te donne tes ordres, mais cette fois, l'assistant du président veut te rencontrer en personne.${prompt}
  7619: Je ne sais pas si les missions que tu as accomplies jusqu'à présent étaient difficiles pour toi...${prompt}
  7620: Mais cette fois, je suis sûr que ce sera un véritable défi.${prompt}
  7621: Je veux dire, tu vas devoir te rendre à la fois à San d'Oria et à Windurst...${prompt}
  7622: |-
    Ce n'est pas comme aller quelque part à proximité, comme Gustaberg ou les Hautes-Terres de Konschtat.
    Tu devras aussi voyager par mer.${prompt}
  7623: |-
    Voici la salle du Président.
    N'oublie pas de rester poli.${prompt}
  7624: (Oh, et veille à ne rien dire qui pourrait l'offenser... Il est vraiment susceptible.)${prompt}
  7625: |-
    Ah, nous vous attendions.
    Je me souviens de vous avoir rencontré après votre première mission.
    Laissez-moi vous présenter. Voici Sir Karst--${prompt}
  7626: Le Président Karst. C'est ainsi que vous m'adresserez.${prompt}
  7627: Lucius, qu'est-ce que c'était que cette histoire de première mission ?${prompt}
  7628: |-
    Le rapport des Mines de Zeruhn, monsieur.
    À propos du Gardien des Talismans--${prompt}
  7629: |-
    Hmph. Ces Galka encore.
    Je n'étais pas informé que vous aviez rencontré le messager, Lucius.${prompt}
  7630: Je n'ai pas jugé nécessaire de vous déranger avec de telles futilités, monsieur.${prompt}
  7631: “Monsieur le Président,” Lucius.${prompt}
  7632: Je vous présente mes excuses. Je suis désolé de ne pas vous avoir informé au sujet des Galka, Monsieur le Président.${prompt}
  7633: |-
    Peu importe.
    Voici tes ordres.${prompt}
  7634: |-
    Comme tu le sais, il y a trois autres nations en plus de la nôtre dans Vana'diel.
    Le Royaume de San d'Oria, la Fédération de Windurst et le Grand Duché de Jeuno.${prompt}
  7635: Jeuno continue de professant la neutralité, donc je veux que tu te rendes à San d'Oria et à Windurst.${prompt}
  7636: Peu importe par où tu commences, tant que tu vas dans les deux. Je vais te donner une lettre de recommandation, que tu présenteras aux consuls des deux nations. Des questions ?${prompt}
  7637: |-
    Des questions ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Que dois-je faire une fois arrivé là-bas ?
    Pourquoi suis-je envoyé ?
    Comment vais-je à San d'Oria ?
    Comment vais-je à Windurst ?
    Où sont les consulats ?
    Pourquoi m'as-tu fait venir ici ?
    Pas de questions.${prompt}
  7638: "Les consuls dans chaque pays te le diront.\nNe t'inquiète pas, on ne te demande pas d'espionner -- les missions qu'on te confiera profiteront autant à ces pays qu'à nous.${prompt} "
  7639: |-
    Pourquoi ? Officiellement, pour promouvoir l'amitié entre nos nations.
    En réalité, pour enquêter sur l'état interne de ces pays, et aussi pour t'entraîner.${prompt}
  7640: San d'Oria se trouve dans le Quon Nord, le même continent que Bastok. Tu peux y aller par la terre.${prompt}
  7641: Va à la ville portuaire de Selbina, au nord-ouest. Une fois là-bas, tu pourras prendre un bateau pour Mhaura, une petite ville à deux pas de Windurst.${prompt}
  7642: |-
    Demande à quelqu'un d'autre si tu veux des détails.
    Je suis le président, pas un agent de voyage.${prompt}
  7643: |-
    Et tu t'appelles un aventurier !?
    Demande simplement aux gardes du pays où tu te trouves !${prompt}
  7644: |-
    Je ne fais pas confiance à mes subordonnés, alors je préfère donner moi-même les ordres les plus importants.
    C'est tout ce que tu dois savoir.${prompt}
  7645: Des questions ?${prompt}
  7646: |-
    Bien.
    Lucius, la lettre.${prompt}
  7647: |-
    Voici ta lettre de recommandation.
    Présente-la aux consuls et ils te donneront de nouvelles instructions.${prompt}
  7648: |-
    Voici tes ordres. Pars rapidement.
    Tu es renvoyé.${prompt}
  7649: |-
    Alors, comment ça s'est passé ?
    Le président t'a-t-il harcelé ?${prompt}
  7650: Je n'arrive toujours pas à croire que le chef Cid ait soutenu ce gars pendant les élections...${prompt}
  7651: |-
    Oups. Tu ne m'as pas entendu dire ça, d'accord ?
    Je dois y aller. Bonne chance pour ta mission !${prompt}
  7652: |-
    Wahou ! Tu es déjà allé à San d'Oria et Windurst ?
    Laisse-moi t'accompagner au bureau du président.${prompt}
  7653: |-
    Alors, comment ça s'est passé ?
    Les Orcs à Ghelsba ou les Yagudo à Giddeus t'ont-ils posé des problèmes ?${prompt}
  7654: Mec, je t'envie. Je suis un Mousquetaire de Myhtril, mais tout ce qu'on me fait faire, c'est surveiller cette porte.${prompt}
  7655: Le capitaine Volker et Iron Eater ont toutes les bonnes missions, et Ayame me rabaisse tout le temps...${prompt}
  7656: |-
    Je suis un Mousquetaire de Myhtril, la crème de la crème !
    Pourquoi est-ce que je dois faire de la garde ? Ce n'est pas juste...${prompt}
  7657: Peut-être que je devrais t'ordonner de balayer les Quadav de Palborough...à toi tout seul.${prompt}
  7658: M-Monsieur le Président !${prompt}
  7659: |-
    Retourne à ton poste, Naji.
    C'est un ordre.${prompt}
  7660: Rapport. Qu'as-tu appris de Windurst et San d'Oria ?${prompt}
  7661: |-
    Quel est ton rapport ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Les détails de ton voyage.
    L'état interne de San d'Oria.
    L'état interne de Windurst.
    L'état des Kindreds.${prompt}
  7662: |-
    Oh, ton voyage s'est bien passé alors ?
    Bah ! Tu te moques de moi, aventurier ? Parle-moi des autres nations maintenant !${prompt}
  7663: |-
    Hmph. Donc ils sont toujours coincés dans leurs traditions ridicules.
    Ils ne sont pas mieux que les Orcs avec lesquels ils se battent.${prompt}
  7664: Hmph. Alors il serait idiot d'attendre de l'aide de ces lâches pour combattre les bêtes...${prompt}
  7665: Tu veux dire qu'il y a quelqu'un qui dirige les hordes de bêtes, alors ?${prompt}
  7666: |-
    Lucius. Parle à Volker de cela et reviens quand tu auras un plan pour gérer cette situation.
    Et n'oublie pas de surveiller les Quadav.${prompt}
  7667: Tu as autre chose à rapporter ?${prompt}
  7668: |-
    Je t'ai accordé tout le temps que je pouvais.
    Lucius, reste et vois ce que tu peux comprendre de cela -- et ne me fatigue pas avec les détails futiles quand tu me feras ton rapport.${prompt}
  7669: Dis-moi en plus sur ce que tu as appris concernant les bêtes sauvages, s'il te plaît.${prompt}
  7670: |-
    Je vois... Il semble qu'il y ait quelqu'un qui contrôle leurs mouvements.
    Mais qui pourrait être assez puissant pour unir ces hordes indisciplinées...?${prompt}
  7671: |-
    Bon travail.
    Il est probable qu'on te demande d'accomplir une autre mission importante dans quelques jours.${prompt}
  7672: Le président, malgré ses paroles sévères, te valorise beaucoup et attend de toi que tu réussisses. Tout comme moi.${prompt}
  7673: |-
    Ah, tu es ici en mission, n'est-ce pas ?
    Nous t'attendions.
    C'est bien de voir que tu es arrivé sain et sauf.${prompt}
  7674: Riault, s'il te plaît.${prompt}
  7675: |-
    Oui, madame.
    D'abord, laisse-moi te parler de l'état actuel de Bastok.${prompt}
  7676: |-
    Bastok a déjà perdu plusieurs ressources majeures face aux Quadav.
    Les Mines de Palborough ont été la plus grande perte.${prompt}
  7677: |-
    Leur situation actuelle ressemble à la nôtre dans notre lutte contre les Orcs.
    Ce n'est que dans les années précédant la Grande Guerre que l'équilibre des forces a autant changé.${prompt}
  7678: |-
    J'ai entendu une rumeur selon laquelle ils se rassemblent derrière un nouveau chef !
    Tu y crois ? Des bêtes sauvages, organisées !?${prompt}
  7679: |-
    Cela présage du malheur, je te le dis.
    Pire encore, nous sommes coincés ici dans cette ville de brutes mal élevées !${prompt}
  7680: |-
    Chantain ! C'est assez.
    Riault, continue, s'il te plaît.${prompt}
  7681: Ta mission est d'aller aux Mines de Palborough, actuellement sous le contrôle des Quadav, et de prélever un échantillon de la ressource en déclin appelée mythril.${prompt}
  7682: 'Pour être précis, nous avons besoin que tu rapportes ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  7683: Grâce à notre accord de coopération mutuelle, Bastok nous permet de t'envoyer dans les mines. Ton véritable objectif est de recueillir autant d'informations que possible sur la technologie avancée de Bastok.${prompt}
  7684: Nous devons découvrir qui ou quoi rassemble les bêtes sauvages, et en même temps faire en sorte qu'il semble que nous coopérons avec Bastok.${prompt}
  7685: C'est pourquoi nous avons besoin que tu enquêtes sur les Mines de Palborough. Elles étaient autrefois la propriété de Bastok... mais de nos jours, aucun Bastoker sensé ne s'en approcherait à un malm, s'il en avait le choix.${prompt}
  7686: Si cela ne tenait qu'à nous, nous voudrions que tu partes vers les mines immédiatement, mais les autorités de Bastok nous ont dit que tu devais d'abord leur faire rapport afin d'obtenir une autorisation.${prompt}
  7687: Je sais que tu préférerais te passer de toute cette paperasse, mais supporte-nous et fais ton rapport à l'officiel bastoker nommé Pius. Il se trouve dans le bureau du président.${prompt}
  7688: Je dois te prévenir que nous pensions que les Humes étaient un peuple raisonnable avant d'arriver ici... mais nous avons découvert que ce n'est pas toujours le cas.${prompt}
  7689: |-
    Leur talent pour faire du profit est incomparable, mais leur sens du devoir laisse un peu à désirer.
    En fait, même leurs fonctionnaires peuvent être gênants. Pour le bien de votre mission, essayez d'être patient.${prompt}
  7690: |-
    Ah, vous avez apporté ${item-singular: 7[2]}.
    Bon travail.${prompt}
  7691: |-
    Je vais demander à Riault de faire un résumé des informations que nous avons pu recueillir sur la technologie bastokienne.
    Riault, s'il vous plaît.${prompt}
  7692: |-
    Ah, vous êtes de retour. Qu'avez-vous trouvé ?
    Hmm... Je vois. Je suis content que vous soyez revenu sain et sauf.${prompt}
  7693: |-
    Riault va rédiger les détails de votre enquête.
    Veuillez lui dire ce que vous avez observé.${prompt}
  7694: |-
    <Soupir>
    Oh, quand pourrons-nous retourner à San d'Oria, je me demande.${prompt}
  7695: |-
    J'en ai assez de ces Humes grossiers et de ces Galka sauvages.
    Je veux partir !${prompt}
  7696: |-
    Je comprends ce que vous voulez dire.
    Même leurs techniques architecturales sont rudimentaires. C'est un miracle que ces bâtiments tiennent encore debout !${prompt}
  7697: Permettez-moi de vous rappeler, à vous deux, que cette nation "crue et sauvage" rivalise avec San d'Oria en termes de puissance sur ce continent ?${prompt}
  7698: San d'Oria ne peut se permettre de se reposer sur ses anciennes gloires. Notre complaisance et notre arrogance seront notre chute.${prompt}
  7699: N'était-ce pas ce genre de discours qui t'a fait envoyer ici en premier lieu, peu importe le fait que tu sois d'ascendance noble ?${prompt}
  7700: Oui, tu devrais faire attention. Comme disait mon grand-père, "Si tu n'as rien de gentil à dire, ne dis rien du tout."${prompt}
  7701: |-
    Oh, tu peux parler, Chantain.
    Riault, n’est-il pas temps que tu aies fini ?${prompt}
  7702: |-
    Tout est terminé, madame.
    Cela conclut la partie de Bastok pour cette mission.${prompt}
  7703: |-
    Tu vas à Windurst ensuite, n’est-ce pas ?
    Fais comme tu as fait ici. Rends-toi au consulat, et ils s’occuperont de toi.${prompt}
  7704: Gloire à San d’Oria, et puisses-tu marcher avec honneur.${prompt}
  7705: |-
    Ta mission est presque terminée.
    Il ne te reste plus qu’à retourner à San d’Oria avec ton rapport.${prompt}
  7706: Oh, tu es l’aventurier avec la lettre d’introduction, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7707: |-
    C’est gentil de ta part d’être venu.
    Ça a dû être un long voyage, prendre un bateau pour un endroit aussi lointain que celui-ci.${prompt}
  7708: J’ai étudié dur pour devenir consul, en espérant être servi par des secrétaires toutes mignonnes, mais mon destin a été d’être envoyé dans ce coin perdu…${prompt}
  7709: |-
    Oh ! Je suis désolé-désolé !
    Ne dis à personne que j’ai dit ça, s’il te plaît ?${prompt}
  7710: Je veux dire, on ne peut pas m’en vouloir — je suis entouré de Humes musqués et de Galka effrayants au lieu de mignonnes… euh, tu vois ce que je veux dire.${prompt}
  7711: |-
    Oh, Mih Ketto ?
    Nous avons un invité ici. Ne devrais-tu pas servir du thé ?${prompt}
  7712: Quel thé ? Nous n’avons plus de thé depuis des mois !${prompt}
  7713: |-
    Alors pourquoi n’as-tu pas renouvelé notre stock ?
    Combien de fois t’ai-je dit…${prompt}
  7714: |-
    Euh… monsieur ?
    Voulez-vous que j’aille en acheter ?${prompt}
  7715: |-
    Hmm, eh bien…
    Maintenant que tu en parles, je ne me souviens pas avoir vu quelqu’un vendre du thé ici…${prompt}
  7716: Hmm ? Tu dis que le thé ne t’intéresse pas ? Tu veux entendre parler de la mission ? Oh, zut…${prompt}
  7717: Je suis désolé, flatter les gens… je veux dire, essayer de rendre les gens heureux-joyeux est devenu une habitude. Ça fait partie du travail.${prompt}
  7718: |-
    Bref, voici ce que tu dois faire…
    Euh… C’est-à-dire… Voyons voir…${prompt}
  7719: Topuru-Kuperu ! De quoi devions-nous lui demander ?${prompt}
  7720: |-
    Hein ? Quoi ?
    M’avez-vous appelé, monsieur ?${prompt}
  7721: |-
    Oh ! Te voilà !
    Tu te faisais si discret que je ne t’ai pas vu !${prompt}
  7722: |-
    La mission, mon vieux, la mission !
    Tu sais, pour l’aventurier de Windurst !${prompt}
  7723: Je sais que tu as le mal du pays, mais j’attends de toi que tu fasses ta part tant que tu es ici !${prompt}
  7724: Euh… je crois que ça avait… quelque chose à voir avec aller aux Mines de Palborough, monsieur…${prompt}
  7725: |-
    Oh… je me souviens maintenant.
    Nous avons besoin de minerai raffiné.${prompt}
  7726: |-
    Quoi ? Est-ce vraiment quelque chose que nous devrions demander à un grand aventurier de Windurst de faire ?
    Et les Mines de Palborough sont infestées de Quadav, en plus !${prompt}
  7727: Pardonnez-moi, monsieur, mais… je pense que c’est notre prétexte pour étudier la technologie bastokane, monsieur…${prompt}
  7728: Oh, je me souviens maintenant. Les Quadav agissent de manière étrange, donc l’aventurier doit aller aux Mines de Palborough pour enquêter.${prompt}
  7729: |-
    C’est très-très vague… Et les Mines de Palborough ne sont-elles pas envahies par les Quadav ?
    N’est-ce pas dangereux ?${prompt}
  7730: Eh bien, les rapports de Windurst disent que les hommes-bêtes de différents types semblent tous montrer le même type de comportement organisé… C’est ce que nous devons enquêter, monsieur.${prompt}
  7731: Mais d’abord, l’aventurier doit rencontrer Sir Pius au Bureau du Président…${prompt}
  7732: Ah, oui ! Pius — Sir Pius. Je crois que nous avons dîné ensemble une fois… ou peut-être était-ce un brunch ?${prompt}
  7733: |-
    Peu importe. Au travail, alors !
    Bonne chance ! Reviens quand tu auras fini !${prompt}
  7734: |-
    Ah, ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} !
    Bon travail ! Bon travail !
    Raconte à Topuru-Kuperu ce que tu as vu.${prompt}
  7735: 'Nous rendrons ce ${item-singular: 7[2]} au gouvernement de Bastok après l’avoir étudié.${prompt}'
  7736: |-
    Donc, tu as réussi à entrer dans une zone infestée d’hommes-bêtes, à accomplir ta mission, et à revenir en un seul morceau. Extraordinaire !
    Ne penses-tu pas, Topuru-Kuperu ?${prompt}
  7737: |-
    Ah, te revoilà !
    Je vois que tu es toujours en un seul morceau !${prompt}
  7738: |-
    Topuru-Kuperu va rédiger ton rapport.
    Raconte-lui ce que tu as vu !${prompt}
  7739: |-
    Oh, mon dieu ! Est-ce vrai !?
    Oh, mon dieu ! Oh, mon dieu !${prompt}
  7740: |-
    C’est tout simplement incroyable que tu aies pu croiser un tel monstre et ne pas être réduit en soupe d’aventurier !
    Ne penses-tu pas, Topuru-Kuperu ?${prompt}
  7741: |-
    Quoi ?
    Oh, d’accord. Je suppose, monsieur.${prompt}
  7742: |-
    Oh, laisse-moi deviner — tu pensais encore à Windurst, n’est-ce pas ?
    Ressaisis-toi, mon vieux ! Tu as du travail à faire !${prompt}
  7743: <Soupir> Windurst…${prompt}
  7744: |-
    Eh bien, tu ne peux pas dire que je n’ai pas essayé.
    Ah — mais tu rapporteras que nous travaillons tous exceptionnellement dur ici, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7745: |-
    Tu pars pour San d’Oria maintenant, n’est-ce pas ?
    Fais un voyage sûr et agréable !${prompt}
  7746: |-
    Puisque tu as visité à la fois San d’Oria et Bastok, tu peux maintenant faire ton retour triomphal à Windurst !
    Oh, et dis à tout le monde qu’on leur passe le bonjour !${prompt}
  7747: |-
    Oui, qu’est-ce qu’il y a ?
    Ah, tu es l’envoyé de ${choice: 0}[San d’Oria/Windurst].${prompt}
  7748: |-
    Va parler à un Galka nommé Grohm — il faisait partie de l’expédition qui a essayé de reprendre les Mines de Palborough aux Quadav par le passé.
    Il devrait être à l’Auberge des Artisans dans les Ateliers de Métallurgie.${prompt}
  7749: |-
    Pourquoi es-tu encore ici ?
    Les Mousquetaires sont généralement chargés de distribuer les missions, et franchement, je trouve ce genre de travail ennuyeux…${prompt}
  7750: |-
    Mais puisque tu es un envoyé, tu es sous ma juridiction.
    Cela dit, je ne peux m’empêcher de me demander quelles sont les véritables intentions des ${choice: 0}[San d’Oriens/Windurstiens]…${prompt}
  7751: Cela dit, tu te rends volontairement dans cet endroit infesté de Quadav, donc je ne peux pas me plaindre, même si tu te révèles être un espion.${prompt}
  7752: |-
    Bref… Tu veux parler à Grohm, à l’auberge des Ateliers de Métallurgie.
    Bonne chance à toi.${prompt}
  7753: |-
    Oh, et quand tu auras terminé ton enquête, fais ton rapport directement à ton consulat.
    C’est notre protocole. Je serais assez contrarié si tu revenais ici.${prompt}
  7754: |-
    Hm ? Que veux-tu ?
    Hé, tu n’es pas de Bastok, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7755: 'Quoi !? Tu es ${choice: 0}[San d’Orien/Windurstien], et tu as écouté ce qu’un officiel bastokan t’a dit de faire ?${prompt}'
  7756: Hah ! Je n’ai aucune idée de pourquoi cet Hume t’a envoyé ici… ni pourquoi ton consulat t’a envoyé à lui en premier lieu.${prompt}
  7757: Tu ferais mieux d’écouter attentivement. Beaucoup d’entre nous sont morts en essayant de reprendre les Mines de Palborough aux Quadav…${prompt}
  7758: Ça n’a peut-être pas d’importance pour un étranger comme toi, mais ils nous envoient toujours, nous les Galka, pour faire le sale boulot !${prompt}
  7759: |-
    Ce qui m’énerve le plus, c’est qu’ils n’y réfléchissent même pas à deux fois !
    Même si tu n’es pas ici depuis longtemps, tu as dû voir comment ils nous traitent.${prompt}
  7760: |-
    Peu importe. Crier sur toi ne changera rien.
    Tu voulais en savoir plus sur le raffinage du minerai, n’est-ce pas ? C’est facile, mais il faut bien se souvenir des étapes.${prompt}
  7761: |-
    Voici comment faire :
    1. Obtiens ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}.
    2. Mets-le dans la partie supérieure de la raffinerie.
    3. Récupère le ${item-singular: 7[2]} dans la partie inférieure de la raffinerie.${prompt}
  7762: 'Tu peux soit acheter ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} à quelqu’un, soit en obtenir en utilisant ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} sur une veine de mythril à l’intérieur de Palborough.${prompt}'
  7763: |-
    La machine de raffinage est si grande que ses sections supérieure et inférieure se trouvent à des étages différents.
    Mets ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} dedans au troisième étage, et elle produira ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} au deuxième étage.${prompt}
  7764: Je sais que ça semble simple, mais ça ne l’est pas. Tu dois faire face aux Quadav, et ils sont partout.${prompt}
  7765: |-
    Tiens, prends ces ${item-plural: 5[2]}.
    Bonne chance. Tu vas en avoir besoin.${prompt}
  7766: Hé, tu es un aventurier, n’est-ce pas ? D’un autre pays ?${prompt}
  7767: |-
    Désolé, je n’ai pas pu m’empêcher d’écouter.
    Je vais aussi aux Mines de Palborough.${prompt}
  7768: |-
    Ne t’inquiète pas, je ne te gênerai pas.
    Je ne pense pas qu’on recherche la même chose de toute façon.${prompt}
  7769: Du moins, pour l’instant.${prompt}
  7770: Mais tu ne devrais pas penser que ta mission se limite à une simple étude des mines.${prompt}
  7771: Les hommes-bêtes semblent avoir trouvé un nouveau chef, et les Quadav deviennent plus puissants de jour en jour. Il pourrait y avoir une autre guerre…${prompt}
  7772: Oh, il y a une chose que tu devrais savoir. Sais-tu pourquoi les Quadav ont pris les Mines de Palborough ?${prompt}
  7773: Les Humes prétendent que les Quadav leur ont volé les mines, mais en réalité, les mines sont la maison des Quadav… non, leur terre sacrée.${prompt}
  7774: Les Quadav préféreraient mourir plutôt que de la perdre. Mais les Humes de Bastok ne le savent pas, et ils s’en moquent.${prompt}
  7775: Bon, il est temps pour moi de partir. Oh, et je m’appelle Lion. Je suis une aventurière, comme toi. On se reverra sûrement.${prompt}
  7776: |-
    Peu importe, crier sur toi ne changera rien.
    Tu voulais en savoir plus sur les hommes-bêtes, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7777: J'ai entendu des rumeurs selon lesquelles ces idiots de Quadav agissent de manière organisée.${prompt}
  7778: On parle même du fait qu'ils ont maintenant un chef, comme pendant la Grande Guerre...${prompt}
  7779: Oh, et il y a un étrange cercle magique au fond des Mines de Palborough. On dit que quiconque le dépasse ne revient jamais.${prompt}
  7780: |-
    Ça semble vraiment suspect, n'est-ce pas ?
    Je suis sûr que tu y trouveras tes réponses.${prompt}
  7781: |-
    Moi ? Oh, non. Je ne retournerai jamais là-bas.
    Bonne chance. Tu vas en avoir besoin !${prompt}
  7782: Ah, tu dois être l'aventurier qui va nous rejoindre dans notre mission. J'ai beaucoup entendu parler de toi.${prompt}
  7783: Nous aimerions tenir une réunion bientôt. Tu auras le temps de te préparer pour la mission après, mais la réunion pourrait prendre un peu de temps. Es-tu prêt maintenant ?${prompt}
  7784: |-
    Quand souhaitez-vous être informé ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Tout de suite.
    Plus tard.${prompt}
  7785: Bien. Venez avec moi.${prompt}
  7786: |-
    Halte, Milady !
    Où allez-vous !?${prompt}
  7787: |-
    Oh, salut !
    Ne faites pas attention à moi, je vais juste au quartier des mines !${prompt}
  7788: Encore ? Nous, les Mousquetaires de Mythril, ne pouvons pas vous accompagner à chaque fois que vous décidez de partir en excursion...${prompt}
  7789: |-
    Je sais, c'est pour ça que j'y vais toute seule ! Ne vous inquiétez pas, tout ira bien !
    Au revoir !${prompt}
  7790: |-
    Non, attendez--
    Zut !${prompt}
  7791: Hé, où va-t-elle ?${prompt}
  7792: |-
    "Où va-t-elle" !?
    Vous, monsieur, étiez en poste pour l'arrêter !${prompt}
  7793: Mais... mais...${prompt}
  7794: Pas de réponse aux Mousquetaires supérieurs, Naji--ou devrais-je vous appeler, "Numéro Cinq" ?${prompt}
  7795: Urgh...${prompt}
  7796: Allez, entrez !${prompt}
  7797: |-
    Merci à tous d'être venus si rapidement.
    Voici votre mission : vous devez monter une attaque sur la forteresse Quadav à Beadeaux.${prompt}
  7798: |-
    Sachez qu'il ne s'agit que d'une attaque limitée.
    Vos principaux objectifs sont de coordonner les tactiques avec des aventuriers expérimentés et de vous familiariser avec le terrain local.${prompt}
  7799: Comme vous pouvez le voir, certains de nos bons amis aventuriers ont accepté de rejoindre les Mousquetaires pour cette opération.${prompt}
  7800: Numéro Quatre, Ayame, a planifié cette opération, donc elle sera en charge.${prompt}
  7801: |-
    Numéro Cinq, Naji, l'assistera.
    Vous devez tous suivre leurs ordres pendant l'opération.
    Ayame, s'il vous plaît ?${prompt}
  7802: |-
    Tout d'abord, nous devons nous rassembler à Beadeaux, près de l'entrée de la forteresse Quadav.
    Vos cibles sont les Quadavs Cuivrés en charge de la défense du périmètre.${prompt}
  7803: |-
    Chacun de vous doit vaincre vingt Quadavs Cuivrés.
    Une fois cet objectif accompli, vous devez vous disperser et battre en retraite, puis vous regrouper à l'entrée.${prompt}
  7804: |-
    N'oubliez pas, le point de rendez-vous est juste à l'intérieur de Beadeaux !
    Que personne ne se perde !${prompt}
  7805: Tu ferais bien de parler. Tu te perdrais même dans ta propre maison Mog.${prompt}
  7806: |-
    Une fois préparés, ne perdez pas de temps et rendez-vous au point de rendez-vous.
    Rompez.${prompt}
  7807: Le chemin vers le point de rendez-vous passe par les Marais de Pashhow. Il est juste à l'intérieur de Beadeaux.${prompt}
  7808: |-
    Traversez les Marais de Pashhow pour atteindre le point de rendez-vous.
    Il est juste à l'intérieur de Beadeaux. Assurez-vous d'apporter tout ce dont vous avez besoin !${prompt}
  7809: |-
    Le point de rendez-vous se trouve de l'autre côté des Marais de Pashhow, juste à l'intérieur de Beadeaux.
    Soyez prêts à toute éventualité.${prompt}
  7810: Ah, vous êtes là. Bien.${prompt}
  7811: Vous avez sûrement déjà entendu cela, mais nous avons besoin de quelqu'un de fiable pour prendre en charge des missions centrées autour de notre ambassade à Jeuno.${prompt}
  7812: 'J’ai parlé au président et au capitaine Volker, et nous sommes unanimes : vous êtes la seule personne apte pour cette tâche.${prompt}'
  7813: Nous vous donnerons une lettre de recommandation, que vous présenterez à notre ambassade à Jeuno pour recevoir de plus amples instructions.${prompt}
  7814: Hans, la lettre.${prompt}
  7815: Oui, monsieur. La voilà.${prompt}
  7816: |-
    Bonne chance.
    Je compte sur vous.${prompt}
  7817: |-
    Vous êtes de retour de Jeuno.
    Pas de temps pour discuter. Venez avec moi.${prompt}
  7818: Vous dites que quelqu'un a introduit un familier dans le bureau du président, mais vous n'aviez pas été averti de sa présence ?${prompt}
  7819: |-
    Oui, monsieur. Nous avons été pris par surprise.
    Je ne pensais pas qu'une telle chose était possible...${prompt}
  7820: Sir Lucius m'a bien envoyé un rapport indiquant que nos défenses magiques étaient insuffisantes, mais je ne pensais pas qu'elles seraient si faciles à briser...${prompt}
  7821: '...${prompt}'
  7822: Père!?${prompt}
  7823: Cornelia...${prompt}
  7824: |-
    Oncle Cid !
    Où est Père ?${prompt}
  7825: |-
    Calme-toi, Cornelia.
    Nous avons la situation sous contrôle.${prompt}
  7826: |-
    Est-ce que Père... ?
    Dites-moi que ce n'est pas vrai...!${prompt}
  7827: |-
    Hmph.
    Ne fais pas de scène. Je ne suis pas encore mort.${prompt}
  7828: Père !${prompt}
  7829: |-
    Cornelia, cela ne te concerne pas.
    Va dans ta chambre.${prompt}
  7830: Lucius, explique ce qui s'est passé.${prompt}
  7831: Le familier a utilisé de la magie pour infiltrer le bâtiment... puis il a traversé le bureau en direction des appartements privés du président.${prompt}
  7832: Heureusement, le président était réveillé à ce moment-là et n'a pas été blessé...${prompt}
  7833: Mais ils ont pris le talisman.${prompt}
  7834: |-
    Le talisman !?
    La clé du sceau du Seigneur des Ombres!?${prompt}
  7835: Il y a vingt ans, nos forces alliées ont vaincu le Seigneur des Ombres dans les Contrées du Nord et l'ont scellé hors de notre monde. Le chef Cid et le capitaine Volker étaient là, je crois.${prompt}
  7836: |-
    Les trois parties de la clé du sceau, les talismans, ont été confiées aux dirigeants de chaque nation pour leur protection.
    Mais maintenant, au moins l'un d'eux est parti...${prompt}
  7837: Qui ferait une telle chose ?${prompt}
  7838: |-
    N'avez-vous pas encore trouvé le coupable ?
    Certes, il y a beaucoup de gens qui me portent rancune...${prompt}
  7839: Mais encore une fois, ces imbéciles du Sénat sont trop occupés à se chamailler entre eux, et les rebelles Galka sont trop sauvages pour posséder des compétences magiques...${prompt}
  7840: '...${prompt}'
  7841: Père ! Ne parle pas des Galka de cette manière !${prompt}
  7842: |-
    Pourquoi es-tu encore ici ?
    Ne t'ai-je pas dit d'aller dans ta chambre ?${prompt}
  7843: '...${prompt}'
  7844: D'après les rapports reçus des autres nations, nous devons supposer que les Kindred tentent de ramener le Seigneur des Ombres.${prompt}
  7845: Alors, nous devons aller dans les Terres du Nord pour enquêter !${prompt}
  7846: Le Sénat devrait approuver avant que je ne puisse laisser les Mousquetaires de Mithril s'éloigner autant de la ville.${prompt}
  7847: |-
    Cela prendrait trop de temps, et le temps est un luxe que nous ne pouvons nous permettre.
    De plus, le Sénat n'a aucun sens de la crise - ils rejetteraient simplement ma proposition.${prompt}
  7848: Alors...${prompt}
  7849: Nous devons trouver quelqu'un sans contraintes légales.${prompt}
  7850: Je vous assigne une mission, aventurier, et vous place sous la juridiction des Mousquetaires.${prompt}
  7851: Vous n'avez pas besoin de répondre immédiatement, mais acceptez-vous ?${prompt}
  7852: |-
    Accepter la mission ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    J'ai besoin de temps.${prompt}
  7853: |-
    Alors discutons en privé.
    Volker, viens avec nous.${prompt}
  7854: |-
    Très bien.
    Parlez au garde chargé des missions quand vous vous sentirez prêt.${prompt}
  7855: |-
    J'ai entendu dire que vous avez accepté la mission.
    Venez avec moi.${prompt}
  7856: |-
    Premièrement, laissez-moi vous parler de votre destination.
    Vous devez voyager vers les Terres du Nord maudites, jusqu'aux ruines de Fei'Yin. Vous trouverez ces ruines dans le coin nord-est du Glacier de Beaucedine.${prompt}
  7857: La ville de Fei'Yin a été construite dans les temps anciens par une civilisation beaucoup plus avancée que la nôtre.${prompt}
  7858: |-
    Nous croyons qu'ils se nommaient eux-mêmes les Zilart.
    Il y a beaucoup d'autres ruines à Vana'diel que l'on pense être de leur fabrication.${prompt}
  7859: |-
    Compte tenu de l'ancienneté de leur construction, leur état de conservation est stupéfiant.
    C'est comme s'ils étaient protégés par une force invisible qui défie le temps lui-même.${prompt}
  7860: Il y a trente ans, une équipe multinationale a été envoyée dans les Terres du Nord pour tenter de découvrir les secrets du pouvoir des Zilart.${prompt}
  7861: Ulrich, l'oncle de Volker - et à l'époque capitaine des Mousquetaires de Mithril - a dirigé la contingence bastokienne de cette expédition.${prompt}
  7862: Malheureusement, ils sont revenus les mains vides.${prompt}
  7863: '...${prompt}'
  7864: |-
    Le Capitaine Volker vous indiquera la route vers votre destination.
    Il a entrepris le même voyage il y a vingt ans, vers la fin de la Grande Guerre.${prompt}
  7865: Même avant la guerre, Fei'Yin était infestée de monstres. Nous l'avons capturée au Seigneur des Ombres au prix de nombreuses vies.${prompt}
  7866: |-
    Après la guerre, nous avons posé des sceaux de chaque côté de la frontière pour contenir les sbires du Seigneur des Ombres.
    Un sceau dans le colisée en ruine à l'intérieur, et un autre à Fei'Yin à l'extérieur.${prompt}
  7867: Cela fait vingt ans. À cette époque, on pouvait atteindre le Glacier de Beaucedine depuis l'Est Ronfaure par le Col de Ranguemont.${prompt}
  7868: |-
    C'est toujours le seul chemin, mais je crois que San d'Oria garde maintenant cette route.
    Vous devrez trouver un moyen de passer.${prompt}
  7869: |-
    Votre objectif est de vérifier que le sceau de Fei'Yin est toujours intact.
    S'il ne l'est pas, remplacez-le par celui que nous vous fournirons.${prompt}
  7870: Vous avez bien un laissez-passer pour le dirigeable, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7871: |-
    Dirigez-vous vers Jeuno, et prenez le vol pour San d'Oria dès que possible.
    Vous êtes congédié.${prompt}
  7872: |-
    Waouh ! Vous êtes revenu de Fei'Yin en un seul morceau !
    Venez avec moi, vite !${prompt}
  7873: Donc... le sceau de Fei'Yin était également brisé.${prompt}
  7874: |-
    Où étaient les San d'Orians !?
    C'était leur devoir de le protéger !${prompt}
  7875: |-
    Monsieur le Président ?
    Devrions-nous demander au Sénat une incursion à Zvahl ?${prompt}
  7876: |-
    Il semble que nous n'ayons pas le choix.
    Mais tant qu'ils ne prennent pas de décision, nous avons les mains liées.${prompt}
  7877: |-
    Nous aimerions que vous restiez en attente pour de nouvelles instructions.
    Nous avons des préparatifs à faire.${prompt}
  7878: |-
    J'ai entendu mentionner que vous avez rencontré un Galka vêtu de noir à Fei'Yin.
    Dites-m'en plus à son sujet.${prompt}
  7879: |-
    Comme je le pensais... c'est Zeid.
    Alors il a suivi la piste des Kindred depuis sa disparition il y a vingt ans.${prompt}
  7880: |-
    Il était le Second Mousquetaire de Mithril - le Galka nommé “Nuage de Guerre”.
    Ah... mais il n'aimait pas qu'on l'appelle par son nom donné par les Humes.${prompt}
  7881: C'est lui qui a vaincu le Seigneur des Ombres... Il aurait dû être Capitaine, pas moi.${prompt}
  7882: |-
    Pourtant, pourquoi s'est-il caché de nous ?
    Qu'y a-t-il dans les Terres du Nord qui aurait tant changé Zeid, et même mon oncle ?${prompt}
  7883: Ah, je m'excuse. Ce n'est pas à moi de poser ces questions. Je ne suis qu'un Mousquetaire, un humble soldat de Bastok.${prompt}
  7884: |-
    Hein ? Non, ce n'est pas la Guilde des Forgerons.
    C'est au nord-ouest.${prompt}
  7885: |-
    Hé, vous êtes un aventurier, n'est-ce pas ?
    J'ai besoin de ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} pour une de mes expériences.${prompt}
  7886: |-
    Pouvez-vous m'en trouver ?
    J'ai entendu dire qu'ils apparaissent pendant les tempêtes de poussière...${prompt}
  7887: Allez demander à Drangord le Galka. Il a dit qu'il en avait trouvé pendant ses années d'aventure.${prompt}
  7888: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} ! Merci, cela va m'aider avec mes expériences !
    Mais je peux toujours en utiliser plus si vous tombez sur des quantités supplémentaires.${prompt}
  7889: Hmm... cette machine dysfonctionne depuis peu. Je me demande si l'huile est devenue mauvaise...${prompt}
  7890: |-
    Cette machine a besoin d'être huilée, mais nous n'avons plus d'huile de machine.
    Qu'est-ce que je pourrais utiliser comme substitut, je me demande ?${prompt}
  7891: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} ? Bien sûr ! Pourquoi n'y ai-je pas pensé ?
    Merci. Tenez, prenez ceci en paiement.${prompt}
  7892: |-
    Mon travail n'est pas si mal, vraiment.
    Travailler avec des machines vaut mieux que de travailler dans les mines tous les jours.${prompt}
  7893: Concevoir de nouveaux produits n'est pas facile. Je ne sais pas comment le Chef Cid y arrive, à inventer de nouvelles choses presque chaque semaine.${prompt}
  7894: Pour être honnête, ce n'est pas toujours facile de travailler avec des Humes, mais on s'y habitue. On doit.${prompt}
  7895: |-
    Il faut être flexible, vous savez ? Il faut suivre le mouvement.
    Sinon, vous finirez dans les mines avec le reste des vieux Galka têtus.${prompt}
  7896: |-
    C'est ici la Forge de l'acier noir.
    Vous avez dû entendre parler de l'acier noir auparavant.${prompt}
  7897: |-
    L'acier noir est un alliage plus dur et plus flexible que l'acier ordinaire. De plus, il ne tache pas et ne rouille pas.
    Le seul inconvénient, c'est qu'il est un peu lourd.${prompt}
  7898: Sa formule a été un secret galkan pendant longtemps, mais récemment, nous avons décidé d'enseigner aux Humes comment le fabriquer également.${prompt}
  7899: Connaissant les Humes, cependant, ils auraient fini par le découvrir et inventer quelque chose de mieux.${prompt}
  7900: |-
    Puis-je vous aider ? Voici la Raffinerie de Cermet.
    Normalement, seuls les ouvriers de l'usine y sont autorisés, mais...${prompt}
  7901: |-
    Eh bien, je suppose que vous êtes d'accord.
    Savez-vous ce qu'est le cermet ? C'est un alliage plus dur et plus léger que l'acier, qui ne rouille pas et peut résister à des chaleurs extrêmes. Impressionnant, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7902: |-
    C'est le produit dérivé de récents progrès en alchimie.
    Grâce au cermet, les designs de moteurs du Chef Cid sont maintenant des années en avance sur leur temps !${prompt}
  7903: |-
    En fait, le cermet... ah, non, je ne peux rien vous dire de plus.
    Juste que... si nous parvenons à trouver un moyen de réduire son coût de production, nous pourrions mettre ces forgerons Galka sur la sellette !${prompt}
  7904: |-
    C'est la Raffinerie de Cermet.
    L'usine est interdite aux personnes non autorisées.${prompt}
  7905: Cela dit, même si ces San d'Orians anachroniques parvenaient à entrer, ils ne comprendraient probablement rien à nos instruments !${prompt}
  7906: Les jeunes Galka qui travaillent ici répondent à leurs noms donnés par les Humes, comme des animaux de compagnie à leur maître ! N'ont-ils donc aucune honte ?${prompt}
  7907: |-
    Tout cela est dû à la perte de notre Gardien de la Parole.
    Si seulement Sir Raogrimm était ici...${prompt}
  7908: |-
    J'ai entendu de bonnes choses à votre sujet. On dirait que vous êtes devenu un sacré aventurier.
    J'ai un travail pour vous.${prompt}
  7909: C'est... eh bien, ce n'est pas une mission, ou quoi que ce soit d'officiel. Juste une faveur personnelle.${prompt}
  7910: |-
    Il y a une taverne dans le District du Port appelée le Restaurant du Mouton Fumant.
    Je veux que vous alliez voir si la tenancière a besoin d'aide.${prompt}
  7911: |-
    Et si elle a besoin d'aide, pourriez-vous essayer de l'aider ?
    Bien sûr, je vous récompenserai pour vos services.${prompt}
  7912: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 7[2]}, hein ?
    Je crois qu'un certain rampeur dans le Nid des Rampants les laisse tomber. Bien sûr, il faudra d'abord l'attirer et le vaincre.${prompt}
  7913: 'Et pour l''attirer, vous aurez besoin d''utiliser ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}.${prompt}'
  7914: Une lettre ?${prompt}
  7915: '...${prompt}'
  7916: |-
    J-Je vois. Mme Hilda a dit ça, hein ?
    Mais je ne voulais pas--non, peu importe.
    Vous avez fait ce que je vous ai demandé. Je vous donnerai une récompense.${prompt}
  7917: |-
    Mais s'il vous plaît, n'en parlez à personne.
    Surtout pas à Raibaht.${prompt}
  7918: Avez-vous dit quelque chose, Chef ?${prompt}
  7919: Gah ! Ne perdez pas de temps à parler ! Retournez au travail !${prompt}
  7920: |-
    Une invitation du Mouton Fumant ? Hmm... S'il vous plaît, n'en parlez pas au Chef.
    Mais dites à la propriétaire que je visiterai son établissement dès que possible.${prompt}
  7921: |-
    Bien de votre part d'être venu.
    La raison pour laquelle je n'ai pas demandé à Naji ou à Iron Eater de vous amener ici, c'est que le secret de cette mission est primordial.${prompt}
  7922: |-
    Volker nous rejoindra bientôt.
    Parlons dans mes appartements privés.
    Venez.${prompt}
  7923: Galina, dis à Volker de venir dans mes appartements privés quand il arrive.${prompt}
  7924: |-
    Nous n'avons pas obtenu l'approbation du Sénat. Les Mousquetaires n'auront pas le droit de sortir des portes de la ville.
    Ces imbéciles pensent que Bastok ne devrait pas s'impliquer...${prompt}
  7925: '"Laissez San d''Oria s''occuper des Terres du Nord" ont-ils dit! À quoi pensent-ils que servent les Mousquetaires?! Ils ne comptent sûrement pas les utiliser dans une autre guerre contre San d''Oria!${prompt}'
  7926: J'admets que Bastok ferait n'importe quoi pour son propre gain. C'est ainsi que nous sommes arrivés si loin - moi inclus.${prompt}
  7927: Le succès de Bastok est le résultat de l'aggression et de l'initiative. Mais avec le Sénat qui traîne des pieds, nous pourrions payer cher notre inaction.${prompt}
  7928: |-
    Souvenez-vous d'une chose : vous êtes un aventurier, pas un héros.
    Vous n'avez aucun devoir envers la majorité - surtout celle qui choisit de rester inactive en un moment pareil.${prompt}
  7929: |-
    Partez en mission pour votre propre gain. C'est la manière bastokienne.
    Ne vous préoccupez pas de la responsabilité - laissez un certain président et un capitaine mousquetaire s'en inquiéter.${prompt}
  7930: |-
    Volker.
    Venez.${prompt}
  7931: |-
    Racontez à l'aventurier ce que vous savez de Château Zvahl.
    Nous n'avons pas beaucoup de temps. Soyez bref.${prompt}
  7932: Traversez le Glacier de Beaucedine jusqu'au coin le plus au nord de Quon, la terre gelée de Xarcabard.${prompt}
  7933: |-
    Là, vous trouverez le Château Zvahl, la forteresse des Kindred.
    C'est là que nos forces alliées ont vaincu le Seigneur des Ombres il y a vingt ans.${prompt}
  7934: |-
    Mais maintenant, quelqu'un essaie de ramener le Seigneur des Ombres.
    Nous devons les arrêter, coûte que coûte.${prompt}
  7935: Si vous arrivez trop tard et qu'ils réussissent... vous et vos amis devrez essayer de vaincre le Seigneur des Ombres par vous-mêmes, comme l'ont fait Cid, Zeid et moi auparavant.${prompt}
  7936: |-
    Vous, les aventuriers, tenez l'avenir de Vana'diel entre vos mains.
    Nous ne pouvons pas vous accompagner, mais nos espoirs et nos cœurs sont avec vous.${prompt}
  7937: |-
    Allez terminer vos préparatifs et partez dès que possible.
    Vous êtes congédié.${prompt}
  7938: Attendez... Si vous voyez Zeid, dites-lui qu'il ne m'a toujours pas surpassé dans un combat... et qu'il devrait revenir me défier.${prompt}
  7939: |-
    Vous l'avez fait !
    Vous avez empêché le retour du Seigneur des Ombres ?!${prompt}
  7940: |-
    De quoi parlez-vous, Volker ?
    Ils l'ont probablement vaincu et renvoyé là où il appartient !
    Ai-je raison ?${prompt}
  7941: Quoi ? Le vaincre ? Mais c'est...${prompt}
  7942: Impossible ? Vous trouvez difficile de croire qu'un aventurier puisse vaincre le Seigneur des Ombres, Capitaine ? N'avez-vous pas entendu ce que disent les citadins ?${prompt}
  7943: Ils disent que l'Ère des Aventuriers est arrivée !${prompt}
  7944: Hmph. Seuls les historiens, dans l'avenir, ont le privilège de dire de telles choses.${prompt}
  7945: Et qu'importe s'ils ont seulement empêché le retour du Seigneur des Ombres, ou s'ils l'ont réellement vaincu.${prompt}
  7946: |-
    L'important est qu'ils aient empêché les Kindred de gagner en puissance.
    Et cela, je crois, mérite une récompense.${prompt}
  7947: |-
    Bon travail. Je vous élève de rang.
    Et voici votre récompense bien méritée.${prompt}
  7948: |-
    Le Seigneur des Ombres peut avoir été vaincu de nouveau, mais les Kindred sont loin d'être défaits.
    J'ai reçu des rapports de phénomènes étranges dans les forteresses des hommes-bêtes.${prompt}
  7949: Vous avez probablement entendu cela trop souvent, mais... nous comptons sur vous.${prompt}

    Alors c'était donc qui le Seigneur des Ombres...
    Zeid devait le savoir, et c'est probablement pour ça qu'il est parti seul.${prompt}
  7951: Ne dites rien de tout cela à Volker. Le destin d'Ulrich devrait aussi lui être caché pour l'instant. Il n'est peut-être pas encore prêt à l'accepter.${prompt}
  7952: Il admirait beaucoup son grand-père... c'est pourquoi ça lui faisait mal d'entendre les gens dire que Volker, lui-même, n'était devenu Capitaine que parce que Raogrimm n'était plus là.${prompt}
  7953: Je sais que cacher la vérité n'est pas une bonne chose, mais la plupart d'entre nous ne sommes pas aussi forts que vous. Nous avons besoin de temps pour guérir.${prompt}
  7954: Désolé d'interrompre. De quoi parlez-vous tous les deux ?${prompt}
  7955: Euh... juste en train de dire que Karst n'a vraiment pas changé, même après tout ça.${prompt}
  7956: |-
    Oui, mais je pense que je le comprends mieux maintenant.
    Peut-être l'ai-je jugé trop sévèrement.${prompt}
  7957: À ce sujet... vous ne nous avez toujours pas dit pourquoi vous avez soutenu le président Karst aux dernières élections, Chef.${prompt}
  7958: Oh, ça. Eh bien... Il y a quinze ans, même après avoir démissionné de mon poste à la tête de la Salle de la Poudre, le Sénat était encore dans le chaos, essayant de trouver plus de gens à blâmer pour l'accident de Palborough.${prompt}
  7959: Mais il y avait un sénateur junior qui a proposé d'abandonner Palborough et de rouvrir les Mines de Zeruhn. Ce sénateur junior était Karst.${prompt}
  7960: |-
    Les mineurs avaient beaucoup à perdre, mais à l'époque, sa proposition était la meilleure option pour Bastok.
    Je suis ingénieur, donc je respecte le talent. Et j'ai senti que les compétences politiques de Karst pouvaient être fiables.${prompt}
  7961: |-
    Et c'est un vrai Bastoker aussi - très ambitieux, et vraiment facile à comprendre.

    Cornelia, le moine qui est devenu Mousquetaire de Mythril, est assez célèbre.
    Elle a aidé tous ceux dans le besoin, qu'ils soient Galka ou Hume, riches ou pauvres.${prompt}
  7977: Tu n'as jamais entendu parler d'elle ? C'était une moine qui est devenue une Mousquetaire de Mythril. Elle aidait tous ceux dans le besoin, Galka et Hume, riches et pauvres.${prompt}
  7978: On racontait qu'elle et le Gardien des Récits Raogrimm--le seul Galka destiné à devenir Capitaine Mousquetaire s'il avait survécu--partageaient un amour interdit...${prompt}
  7979: Mais personne ne sait si c'était vrai, car aucun des deux n'est revenu de leur expédition à Xarcabard il y a trente ans.${prompt}
  7980: Ma mère m'a nommée d'après elle. Elle m'a dit qu'elle voulait que je grandisse pour lui ressembler--quelqu'un qui traite tout le monde également et aimé de tous.${prompt}
  7981: C'est peut-être pour ça que j'essaie tellement d'aider les Galka... mais même si je ne m'appelais pas Cornelia, je ne resterais pas là à les voir être traités comme ils le sont.${prompt}
  7982: Mais ça ne marche pas. Tu l'as vu toi aussi. J'ai l'impression de tout rater. J'aimerais être aussi forte et intelligente que Dame Cornelia...${prompt}
  7983: Un jeune Galka m'a dit l'autre jour, « Pourquoi t'efforces-tu autant ? Qu'est-ce que tu peux faire, tu n'es qu'une fille ! »${prompt}
  7984: Peut-être qu'il a raison. Peut-être que je ne peux rien changer...${prompt}
  7985: |-
    Non ! Je dois essayer encore plus fort !
    Je vais montrer à ce monsieur-je-sais-tout, Gumbah, de quoi je suis capable !${prompt}

  7990: Je compile des données sur les effets des projets miniers et industriels de Bastok sur l'environnement.${prompt}
  7991: Ces roues suffisent à alimenter Bastok maintenant, mais que feront-elles lorsque les besoins de la ville dépasseront la quantité d'énergie qu'elles peuvent produire ?${prompt}
  7992: J'ai entendu des aventuriers dire que le déversement de déchets industriels par les Quadav a pollué Beadeaux et ses environs.${prompt}
  7993: |-
    J'aimerais examiner un peu de ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.

    Ah, tu m'as apporté un peu de ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} de Beadeaux que j'ai demandé !
    Merci. Cela m'aidera dans mes recherches.${prompt}
  7995: Les scientifiques Humes disent qu'ils se moquent éperdument de l'environnement des Quadav, mais cela pourrait nous être utile à l'avenir... Oh, je suis désolé, je ne voulais pas me plaindre. Tiens, laisse-moi te récompenser.${prompt}
  7996: |-
    Regarde autour de toi. Vois-tu ce que la technologie de Bastok peut faire ?
    Cette technologie est ce qui nous rend meilleurs que San d'Oria ou même Windurst.${prompt}
  7997: Et grâce à cette technologie, je peux laisser les machines faire le travail pendant que je reste ici à ne rien faire toute la journée !${prompt}
  7998: |-
    Cette place des roues à eau est le centre de Bastok.
    Ce bâtiment à l'est est le Bureau du Président.${prompt}
  7999: Le Bureau de l'Aide Présidentielle est au sud-est, tandis que les consulats de Jeuno, Windurst et San d'Oria sont, respectivement, au nord-est, au nord-ouest et au sud-ouest de la place.${prompt}
  8000: C'est verrouillé.${prompt}

    Tu vois cette constellation au sud ? C'est le gardien de Bastok, Titan !
    Mais peu de gens le savent maintenant. Ça fait longtemps que nous n'avons pas célébré la Veillée de Titan.${prompt}
  8007: L'étoile jaune au centre est Daemdalus, ou “le pied gauche de Titan.” Elle était beaucoup plus brillante autrefois, et les soldats revenant de bataille la suivaient pour rentrer à Bastok.${prompt}
  8008: |-
    Je suis heureux d'avoir rencontré quelqu'un d'autre qui aime regarder les étoiles.

    Your brother was a talented monk who met a tragic death.
    When you came to me, I put two and two together.${prompt}
  8148: However, your vision is still clouded...clouded by the darkness of revenge.${prompt}
  8149: |-
    Master Oggbi... You have trained me well, and I thank you.
    But if you believe that my vision is still clouded...${prompt}
  8150: '...Then I must set out on my own to clear it!${prompt}'
  8151: Cornelia...${prompt}
  8152: And she succeeded in bringing down that Yagudo. Whether that cleared her vision or not...${prompt}
  8153: Well, he shows interest in monks who are at his level of power, and only comes out when suitable opponents make their way into his lair.${prompt}
  8154: 'Take ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} and place it deep within the castle. Your strength is certain to catch his eye and draw him out of hiding.${prompt}'
  8155: 'If you defeat him, he should leave ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}. Bring that back to me and I will reward you for your efforts.${prompt}'
  8156: This is a task that I should be taking on myself, but I just don't have the legs for it anymore...${prompt}
  8157: |-
    This is... So you were able to defeat the Yagudo?
    I did not know such powerful monks still existed...${prompt}
  8158: Long ago, Master Oggbi worked hard to promote the fusion of martial arts and San d'Orian combat techniques. Such a collaboration has obviously produced many outstanding fighters.${prompt}
  8159: Even a samurai such as myself is in awe of your extraordinary ability. Please accept this as payment for your service.${prompt}
  8160: Another item had been arranged for you, but Master Oggbi asked to present this to you instead.${prompt}
  8161: |-
    I see you have returned safely...
    You have matured well as a monk.${prompt}
  8162: This is a token of my gratitude. You remind me much of Cornelia...${prompt}
  8163: Yes, I remember she came to see me in the Metalworks when she returned...${prompt}
  8164: Cornelia! You're finally back...${prompt}
  8165: Master... I apologize for creating so much trouble.${prompt}
  8166: |-
    You need not worry of that...
    Your vision... Is it still clouded as before?${prompt}
  8167: |-
    That's just it...
    I thought that by avenging my brother's death, I would be free of the demons that haunted me...but in truth, I feel as though a part of me died when I defeated that Yagudo...${prompt}
  8168: I see...${prompt}
  8169: Nothing comes of revenge. It merely results in us losing that which drives us.${prompt}
  8170: You...${prompt}
  8171: It is said that those with nothing to lose are often the strongest.${prompt}
  8172: |-
    More than likely you felt the same way, Cornelia.
    But remember that if you have nothing to lose, you may have nothing at all...${prompt}
  8173: |-
    ...nothing worth protecting.
    True strength comes to those who have something, or someone, to protect.${prompt}
  8174: And you...have something worth protecting?${prompt}
  8175: I carry with me over two hundred years of memories. At times they can be a burden, but it is my duty to protect them.${prompt}
  8176: To protect the smiles of the people in those memories, I can handle the treatment I receive from those petty politicians in the President's Office.${prompt}
  8177: Will I ever find something...something worth protecting? ${prompt}
  8178: I am certain that one day you will.${prompt}
  8179: And that was the dawn of a new Musketeer in Cornelia.${prompt}
  8180: |-
    You, too, must make a pledge--that you will never use your ability to lose something.
    Make that pledge, and your power will never betray you.${prompt}
  8181: I still believe to this day that Cornelia made that pledge...${prompt}
  8182: 'What? My grandma asked you to bring ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} to me?${prompt}'
  8183: |-
    I can't believe her. “My grandson the doorman.” I get teased enough by Ayame, but to be ridiculed by my own flesh and blood!
    And this sword... What's the big deal, anyway?${prompt}
  8184: What's wrong, Naji?${prompt}
  8185: |-
    Ah, Sir Iron Eater.
    My grandmother...${prompt}
  8186: |-
    I see.
    This sword belonged to your father, Lord Yasin.
    This may even be the sword that he used when...${prompt}
  8187: |-
    Sir?
    You have met my father before?${prompt}
  8188: Once, thirty years ago... But I was still a child.${prompt}
  8189: |-
    Welcome back, Sir Raogrimm!
    Did you beat up some Orcs this time?${prompt}
  8190: Pagdako. My mission this time was a simple expedition. There was no “beating up” of any Orcs.${prompt}
  8191: Yeah, but it makes no difference for a hired hand like me. I had me some fun, and found some good material for making a new sword to boot!${prompt}
  8192: We bumped into this other party too... Yeah, some old monk traveling with a cute, feisty young girl.${prompt}
  8193: I have no interest in the methods you use in “finding” good material, but I do know you are quite a fighter. It is a pity that you waste your talent on adventuring.${prompt}
  8194: Oh, please. What adventures await me with the title of Musketeer? Guard duty? Heh, I'm no doorman!${prompt}
  8195: |-
    You are a strange sort, Yasin.
    That material you brought back--I'll have one of my blacksmith companions make it into a sword for you. That will be your payment for your duties this time. Agreed?${prompt}
  8196: Sounds good to me, Musketeer.${prompt}
  8197: When I grow up, I wanna be a big, brave Musketeer, just like Sir Raogrimm!${prompt}
  8198: Pagdako, being a Musketeer is not necessarily about going out on missions and fighting monsters. At times, we must deal with enemies who are behind our own walls. If you can handle that burden as well, I believe you will make a fine Musketeer indeed.${prompt}
  8199: There's no doubt about it. That sword is the one that Sir Raogrimm--the Mythril Musketeer and Galka Talekeeper himself--had made for your father.${prompt}
  8200: |-
    Wow... I never knew that my father knew such important people.
    And Sir Iron Eater, I never knew your real name was...what did you say it was, Pacdaco?${prompt}
  8201: |-
    ......
    Feel free to call me whichever is easiest for you to pronounce. It makes no difference to me. A name is not important, only the man behind it.${prompt}
  8202: |-
    Well, thanks for bringing this to me. I'll try to use it as my father did.
    Here, you can have this. It's been used quite a bit, but I'm sure you'll find a good home for it.${prompt}
  8203: You receive nothing from the moon rabbit...${prompt}
  8204: The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!${prompt}

  8230: Tous les trois nations s'efforcent chaque jour de mettre davantage de régions sous leur contrôle. C'est ce que nous appelons les "conquêtes". Vous pouvez y participer et servir votre pays en vainquant des ennemis pendant que le Sceau est jeté sur vous.${prompt}
  8231: Chaque région se compose de plusieurs zones, et la nation qui débarrasse ces zones du plus grand nombre de monstres obtient le contrôle de la région.${prompt}
  8232: Les nations reçoivent des biens et des ressources des régions sous leur contrôle.${prompt}
  8233: Ainsi, plus nous contrôlons de régions, plus notre nation devient riche.${prompt}
  8234: |-
    Des gardes-frontières sont également placés dans des postes avancés au sein des régions sous notre contrôle.
    Ils sont là pour jeter le Sceau sur des aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
  8235: Une fois que vous avez le Sceau de votre nation, vous pourrez acquérir des cristaux auprès des ennemis que vous vainquez.${prompt}
  8236: Non seulement cela, mais vous recevrez également des points de conquête. Vous obtenez plus de points de conquête si vous vainquez des ennemis dans des régions qui ne sont pas sous le contrôle de votre nation. Ces points peuvent être utilisés pour acheter des objets auprès de gardes comme moi.${prompt}
  8237: |-
    So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.
    We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt}
  8238: |-
    You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.
    Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt}
  8239: |-
    Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.
    The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt}

    You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.

  8243: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt}
  8244: |-
    You also receive rank points for completing missions.
    Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt}

    You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.
    Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}
  8246: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt}
  8247: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt}
  8248: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt}
  8249: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt}
  8250: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt}
  8251: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt}
  8252: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt}
  8253: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt}
  8254: |-
    Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.
    If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt}
  8255: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt}
  8256: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt}
  8257: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt}
  8258: There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt}
  8259: |-
    Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.

  8615: Eh bien, l'endroit est un havre pour les pirates. Ils ont même des liens avec les Tenshodo. En tout cas, c'est une zone qu'on ne peut pas prendre à la légère.${prompt}
  8616: C'est pourquoi nous voulons que tu voyages là-bas en tant qu'émissaire. Rends-toi au bureau du Président pour voir Sir Naji et obtenir plus de détails.${prompt}
  8617: Actuellement, l'ingénieur en chef Cid mène des recherches sur l'architecture à Ro'Maeve près du Sanctuaire de Zi'Tah. Ta prochaine mission est de voyager là-bas et de l'assister.${prompt}
  8618: Rends-toi aux Ateliers Métalliques pour plus de détails auprès de l'ingénieur en chef.${prompt}
  8619: Nous recherchons un aventurier détenant des informations vitales concernant une certaine enquête nationale.${prompt}
  8620: Le président lui-même a montré un grand intérêt pour cette affaire. Va au bureau du Président pour les détails de cette mission.${prompt}
  8621: 'Le président t''a ordonné de livrer ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. Quand tu auras accompli cette tâche, tu pourras revenir ici pour ta prochaine mission.${prompt}'
  8622: On dirait que Bastok va vraiment commencer une enquête sur la patrie des Galka, Altepa.${prompt}
  8623: Ton rôle dans cette enquête te fera voyager vers les Grottes des Sables Mouvants. Récupère les détails de cette mission auprès de Mangeur de Fer au bureau du Président.${prompt}
  8624: En continuation de l'enquête de Bastok sur Altepa, cette fois tu voyageras vers l'île de Zepwell.${prompt}
  8625: Tu mèneras ta partie de l'enquête dans le Tunnel de Kuftal, qui relie le Cap Teriggan à l'île de Zepwell. Rends-toi aux Mines de Zeruhn pour voir Croc de Dragon pour les détails.${prompt}
  8626: Le Sénateur Alois a demandé ton assistance.${prompt}
  8627: C'est quelque chose à propos d'une expédition à Vollbow...${prompt}
  8628: J'espère juste qu'il ne te demande pas d'aller chercher des œufs de lézard encore une fois... Attends, tu n'as pas entendu ça.${prompt}
  8629: Récemment, un aventurier envoyé pour enquêter sur les Terres du Nord a été attaqué.${prompt}
  8630: Selon son rapport, l'attaquant ressemblait au chevalier noir Zeid.${prompt}
  8631: La chose étrange, c'est que l'attaquant a passé une lettre à l'aventurière avant de la laisser partir. Maintenant, le contenu de cette lettre cause tout un émoi au bureau du Président.${prompt}
  8632: On t'a demandé de te présenter directement au Président Karst pour plus de détails.${prompt}
  8633: Ah, ${name-player}. On dirait que tu es prêt pour ta prochaine mission. J'ai entendu dire que tu voyages vers Norg cette fois-ci.${prompt}
  8634: Quoi ? Je suis censé te donner les détails ? C'est drôle. Je ne me souviens pas avoir été affecté à cette mission...${prompt}
  8635: On dirait que le garde nous a confondus - comme si cela pouvait arriver. C'est moi qui vais transmettre les ordres aux aventuriers.${prompt}
  8636: Comme si cela pouvait arriver !?${prompt}
  8637: Ta mission à Norg est celle d'un émissaire commercial.${prompt}
  8638: Norg tente constamment de renforcer ses liens avec les aventuriers. Ils comptent souvent sur eux pour effectuer certains travaux liés au commerce.${prompt}
  8639: Comparé à Windurst et San d'Oria, les relations de Bastok avec Norg sont bien plus profondes. C'est pourquoi, pour le bien du commerce de notre république, nous envoyons des aventuriers dans un endroit aussi éloigné.${prompt}
  8640: J'étais censé t'accompagner dans cette mission, mais d'abord je dois accomplir une autre petite tâche.${prompt}
  8641: Voyage vers Norg et rencontre leur chef, Gilgamesh. Il te donnera plus d'informations sur ce que tu dois faire. Je te rejoindrai à Norg quand j'aurai terminé mon assignment actuel.${prompt}
  8642: |-
    Et c'est le résumé de tout ça...
    Attends. Avant que tu partes, pourrais-tu venir ici une seconde ?${prompt}
  8643: La raison pour laquelle je t'ai appelé ici, c'est que je veux que tu essaies de terminer cette mission le plus vite possible... de préférence, avant l'arrivée d'Ayame.${prompt}
  8644: Je sais que ça doit sembler étrange, mais tu dois m'aider ici. Récemment, Ayame a agi... eh bien, étrangement. C'est comme si elle manquait de ce, ce "quelque chose".${prompt}
  8645: L'autre jour, elle a été vaincue par un ennemi que, eh bien, même toi tu aurais pu battre.${prompt}
  8646: Et maintenant, elle utilise ça comme excuse pour recommencer son entraînement de samouraï.${prompt}
  8647: Tu peux probablement le voir en me regardant, mais nous, les Mousquetaires de Mithril, ne passons pas beaucoup de temps sur la ligne de front.${prompt}
  8648: Cela rend difficile pour nous de garder nos compétences de combat affûtées. Je pense que c'est ce qui tracasse Ayame. Elle veut retrouver ce qu'elle pense avoir perdu.${prompt}
  8649: Et maintenant, elle veut voyager vers Norg. Ça ne fera qu'empirer les choses !${prompt}
  8650: Autant que je veuille être le numéro quatre, je ne veux pas l'être parce qu'elle part. C'est pourquoi elle doit rester une Mousquetaire.${prompt}
  8651: |-
    Tu sais ce que tu as à faire !
    Et ne dis pas un mot de ça à Ayame...${prompt}
  8652: |-
    Tu es enfin de retour de Norg.
    Alors, as-tu vu Ayame ?${prompt}
  8653: Tu veux dire, elle a dit tout ça ?${prompt}
  8654: Je suppose qu'elle est allée à Norg pour reconfirmer ce qu'elle savait déjà au fond de son cœur.${prompt}
  8655: Hé, ne va pas lui dire que je me suis inquiété pour elle, d'accord !${prompt}
  8656: C'est juste que, eh bien, Ayame obtient toutes les bonnes missions alors que je n'ai rien. J'aimerais aller à Norg...${prompt}
  8657: Je ne pense pas que Norg ait besoin de plus de portiers.${prompt}
  8658: Ouais, tu as probablement raison...${prompt}
  8659: Attends une minute ! Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire par "portier" !?${prompt}
  8660: Tu bouges d'un pouce de ton poste et je t'envoie nettoyer les latrines !${prompt}
  8661: |-
    Oui, madame.
    Tout est clair sur le front nord...${prompt}
  8662: Ah, c'est agréable de te revoir. Mais assez de salutations ; laisse-moi te parler de ta prochaine mission.${prompt}
  8663: Tu as entendu parler de la civilisation ancienne des Zilart, n'est-ce pas ? Eh bien, il y a des vestiges archéologiques de cette civilisation éparpillés dans Vana'diel.${prompt}
  8664: Les Zilart utilisaient un matériau appelé cermet pour construire beaucoup de ces structures. Ce cermet est plus avancé que tout ce qu'on trouve à Bastok.${prompt}
  8665: Rechercher et reproduire ce matériau ferait des merveilles pour l'industrie de Bastok. La technologie cermet ancienne est, pour ainsi dire, la pierre angulaire de l'avenir.${prompt}
  8666: 'Au cœur du Sanctuaire de Zi''Tah, tu trouveras l''entrée de Ro''Maeve. Je veux que tu m''apportes un ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} de là-bas.${prompt}'
  8667: Je t'attendrai ici.${prompt}
  8668: 'Ha ha ! Tu as mis la main sur ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} ! Maintenant, je peux continuer ma recherche sur le cermet.${prompt}'
  8669: Chef Cid...${prompt}
  8670: Ne t'énerve pas, Raibaht. Je n'ai pas l'intention de réduire les recherches sur l'acier sombre.${prompt}
  8671: Chef, nous avons un visiteur.${prompt}
  8672: Merci.${prompt}
  8673: Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas, Cornelia ? Tu t'es encore disputée avec ton père ?${prompt}
  8674: Ce n'est pas ça... mais ça concerne mon père.${prompt}
  8675: Il y a quelques minutes, j'ai rencontré ce jeune Galka.${prompt}
  8676: Oh ! Te voilà, Cornelia !${prompt}
  8677: Gumbah ! Pourquoi m'as-tu suivie ?${prompt}
  8678: J'avais quelque chose à te demander, et j'étais inquiet de ce que je ferais si je ne te trouvais pas.${prompt}
  8679: Hé, attends. Tu ne vas pas m'envoyer dans une de tes quêtes bizarres, n'est-ce pas ? Je ne peux plus te faire confiance après la dernière fois.${prompt}
  8680: Je ne t'ai jamais fait faire quelque chose de si bizarre ! De toute façon, cette fois, c'est différent. Je veux que tu cherches Werei pour moi.${prompt}
  8681: Tu veux parler du même Werei avec qui tu as vécu il y a un moment ? Le même Werei qui a disparu...${prompt}
  8682: Il n'a pas disparu... Il est parti pour son voyage de renaissance. Je ne m'attends pas à le revoir sous la forme de Werei.${prompt}
  8683: Mais, partir sans rien dire... Ça n'a aucun sens. Il doit y avoir une raison.${prompt}
  8684: Et donc, je me suis dit que si je te demandais, tu pourrais peut-être faire quelque chose. La situation dans le quartier des Mines ne s'améliore pas, et toute information serait utile.${prompt}
  8685: Mais, je ne sais pas si je pourrais t'aider...${prompt}
  8686: Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ? Ton père est le président. Ne pourrais-tu pas simplement lui demander de t'aider ?${prompt}
  8687: Comment savais-tu ça... !?${prompt}
  8688: Tu penses que je ne le savais déjà pas ? Tout le monde le sait. Es-tu encore dans le noir ?${prompt}
  8689: Eh bien... même si je suis la fille du président, je ne peux pas utiliser ma position de cette manière. Ce ne serait pas juste.${prompt}
  8690: Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ? Tu dis toujours que tu veux aider les Galka !${prompt}
  8691: Tu ne mentais pas, n'est-ce pas ? Ou était-ce juste ta façon de montrer de la pitié pour nous, pauvres Galka ?${prompt}
  8692: Gumbah ! Comment peux-tu dire une chose pareille ? Bien sûr que je veux vous aider, c'est juste que...${prompt}
  8693: Tu dis ça juste pour te sentir mieux. Que ça te plaise ou non, tu es en position de pouvoir.${prompt}
  8694: Pourquoi ne pas utiliser ce pouvoir ? Arrête d'essayer de fuir... ça...${prompt}
  8695: |-
    Quoi !?
    Si tu as quelque chose à me dire, dis-le !${prompt}
  8696: |-
    Je suis désolé, Cornelia. Je ne le pensais pas...
    Oublie ce que j'ai dit. Je vais essayer de chercher Werei par moi-même.${prompt}
  8697: Ce Gumbah ! Je n'arrive pas à le croire parfois !${prompt}
  8698: Alors, tu as parlé à ton père ?${prompt}
  8699: |-
    Non...
    Je n'ai pas pu lui demander de l'aide.${prompt}
  8700: Cornelia. Je ne suis qu'un ingénieur simple. Je ne sais pas quelle est la meilleure option ici.${prompt}
  8701: Mais je sais une chose...${prompt}
  8702: À l'époque où Bastok était rempli de vieilles maisons en bois, il y a eu un grand incendie qui a détruit la plupart des habitations.${prompt}
  8703: Cependant, à cette époque, Bastok était un pays pauvre, et très peu de fonds pouvaient être utilisés pour la reconstruction des maisons.${prompt}
  8704: Deux propositions ont été faites au gouvernement. L'une était de collecter des dons.${prompt}
  8705: L'autre était de donner la priorité aux marchands de cette zone en échange de contributions à la reconstruction. C'était le plan proposé par ton jeune père.${prompt}
  8706: Lequel penses-tu être juste, Cornelia ?${prompt}
  8707: Demander... des dons aux gens ?${prompt}
  8708: Je suppose que c'est une façon de résoudre le problème. C'est ce que le président de l'époque a choisi, et ça l'a aidé à obtenir des votes.${prompt}
  8709: Cependant, six mois se sont écoulés, et la reconstruction du quartier n'était même pas proche d'être terminée. Il y avait encore des gens vivant dans les rues sans endroit où aller.${prompt}
  8710: Le plan de ton père a finalement été mis en œuvre, et lentement mais sûrement, le quartier a commencé à reprendre forme.${prompt}
  8711: Peut-être que c'est juste l'ingénieur en moi qui parle, mais je pense que lorsque tu es trop occupé à choisir les pièces, tu perds parfois de vue ce que tu essaies vraiment de fabriquer.${prompt}
  8712: Ne vas pas oublier ce que tu essaies de fabriquer maintenant, Cornelia. Tu dois décider ce que tu vas faire.${prompt}
  8713: Oh, ${name-player}. Je suis désolé que tu aies dû entendre tout ça. Tu peux y aller maintenant. Je ferai le rapport.${prompt}
  8714: 'Ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} que tu m''as apporté... Cela m''aidera à me rapprocher de ce que j''essaie vraiment de fabriquer.${prompt}'
  8715: Merci d'être venu, ${name-player}. Actuellement, nous enquêtons sur l'endroit où se trouve un certain Galka nommé Werei. Tu as entendu parler de lui, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8716: On dirait qu'un autre Galka vieillissant vient de partir pour son voyage de renaissance, mais les résidents du quartier des Mines ne le prennent pas très bien.${prompt}
  8717: Il y a tellement de préjugés concernant ces problèmes raciaux, c'est difficile d'agir sur quoi que ce soit.${prompt}
  8718: Cependant, il y a une chose qui m'intéresse. Il y a une rumeur selon laquelle un certain aventurier a reçu une lettre de ce Werei.${prompt}
  8719: J'aimerais que tu trouves cet aventurier et que tu découvres ce qu'il sait. Cependant...${prompt}
  8720: Viens, suis-moi.${prompt}
  8721: Madame. Un aventurier souhaite vous parler.${prompt}
  8722: Est-ce que cela signifie que mon père a enfin accepté de commencer une enquête !?${prompt}
  8723: Père ! Qu'est-ce que cela signifie !?${prompt}
  8724: Ne te méprends pas, Cornelia. Si tu veux t'enfermer dans cette pièce, je ne t'en empêcherai pas.${prompt}
  8725: J'ai reçu un rapport de Iron Eater indiquant que trouver l'endroit où se trouve Werei pourrait aider à calmer certains des Galka dans le quartier des Mines.${prompt}
  8726: Je suis ici uniquement pour recueillir des informations sur le sujet auprès de ceux qui pourraient savoir quelque chose - à savoir toi. Je n'ai pas de temps pour tes petits jeux.${prompt}
  8727: Mais, quand j'ai essayé de te parler avant, tu n'as pas voulu...${prompt}
  8728: As-tu des informations pour moi ? Si non, je vais assigner cet aventurier à une autre mission, et ce sera la fin des choses.${prompt}
  8729: |-
    Attends...
    J'ai entendu quelque chose au restaurant Mouton Fumant. Un aventurier nommé Hani...${prompt}
  8730: Cet aventurier a dit qu'il avait rencontré Werei en traversant le Tunnel de Korroloka, et qu'il avait reçu une lettre de lui.${prompt}
  8731: Cependant, depuis, personne ne l'a vu.${prompt}
  8732: La propriétaire du Mouton Fumant, Hilda, pourrait en savoir plus...${prompt}
  8733: Compris. ${name-player} va continuer l'enquête à partir de là.${prompt}
  8734: Attends, Père.${prompt}
  8735: Suis-je... suis-je stupide de penser que je peux faire la différence, ou suis-je juste une hypocrite ?${prompt}
  8736: Cornelia...${prompt}
  8737: J'ai entendu une légende d'Extrême-Orient qui disait que l'hypocrisie naît des actes de bonté que l'on accomplit.${prompt}
  8738: Alors que le mot utilisé pour symboliser un simple acte de la nature humaine, au fil des années, le sens du mot est devenu déformé pour prendre le ton négatif qu'il a aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  8739: Chaque fois que quelqu'un essaie de faire quelque chose, il y aura toujours quelqu'un pour le juger. J'ai vécu cela toute ma vie, mais ça ne m'a jamais empêché de poursuivre mes objectifs.${prompt}
  8740: Je ne laisserai personne se mettre en travers de mon chemin.${prompt}
  8741: Tu as encore une bonne dizaine d'années avant de pouvoir te plaindre de ce qui est juste ou pas. N'oublie pas ça.${prompt}
  8742: Père...${prompt}
  8743: ${name-player}. Tu as tes ordres. Parle avec Hilda au restaurant Mouton Fumant et découvre plus d'informations sur ce personnage Hani.${prompt}
  8744: Lady Cornelia s'est enfermée dans sa chambre et ne veut pas en sortir...${prompt}
  8745: Qu'est-ce que tu dis ? Le Hani en question s'est fait capturer par les Quadav ? À en juger par cela, vous les aventuriers avez un mode de vie plutôt insouciant.${prompt}
  8746: Peu importe. Nous pouvons maintenant être certains que Werei est parti en voyage de son plein gré. Laisse-moi te récompenser pour ton service et augmenter ton rang.${prompt}
  8747: La lettre que tu portes - livre-la au destinataire approprié. Je ne vais pas laisser ce problème s'aggraver en m'en mêlant. Laisse les Galka voir la vérité de leurs propres yeux.${prompt}
  8748: Je vois que tu as déjà livré la lettre au bon destinataire. Je ne vais pas laisser ce problème s'aggraver en m'en mêlant. Laisse les Galka voir la vérité de leurs propres yeux.${prompt}
  8749: On t'attendait. Le Capitaine Volker t'attend dans la Salle de Conférence.${prompt}
  8750: Ah, ${name-player}. Pour ta prochaine mission, je voudrais que tu voyages vers le Désert d'Altepa pour enquêter sur les Grottes des Sables Mouvants. Ces grottes sont un lieu important parmi les ruines de la civilisation Galka.${prompt}
  8751: Pourquoi, demandes-tu, commençons-nous une enquête sur les ruines Galka ?${prompt}
  8752: Tout a commencé avec une lettre adressée à Mangeur de Fer.${prompt}
  8753: '"Le moment est venu de déverrouiller le passé et de faire un pas vers l''avenir. J''attends l''aventurier près de la statue du Gardien des Récits dans les Grottes des Sables Mouvants."${prompt}'
  8754: Il n'y a pas de nom sur la lettre, mais je sais qui l'a écrite... Zeid.${prompt}
  8755: Si je le pouvais, j'irais moi-même. Cependant, si je le faisais, Zeid ne se montrerait certainement pas.${prompt}
  8756: Tu as rencontré Zeid quand tu as vaincu le Seigneur des Ombres. S'il doit parler avec quelqu'un, ce serait toi.${prompt}
  8757: Ta mission est de rechercher cette "statue du Gardien des Récits" et de découvrir ce que Zeid voulait dire par "déverrouiller le passé".${prompt}
  8758: Les Grottes des Sables Mouvants sont enveloppées de mystère. Nous ne savons pas grand-chose de cette zone. Tu pourrais rencontrer de nombreuses difficultés pendant ton enquête, mais nous comptons sur ton succès.${prompt}
  8759: Je te souhaite la bienvenue après ton voyage. Qu'as-tu trouvé dans les Grottes des Sables Mouvants ?${prompt}
  8760: Je vois... L'histoire des Galka...${prompt}
  8761: Zeid doit ressentir la même chose que moi - que c'est un tournant dans notre histoire.${prompt}
  8762: Cependant, sa mention du Gardien des Récits... Croirait-il vraiment qu'il y en a un nouveau parmi nous ?${prompt}
  8763: '"Et pourquoi Zeid voudrait-il soudainement voir Volker ? Que devrais-je dire au \ncapitaine...?"${prompt}'
  8764: |-
    Ah, excuse-moi.
    Excellent travail sur ta mission. Je vais m'occuper de la suite. Cependant, je sens que nous pourrions avoir besoin de tes services à l'avenir pour une enquête sur l'île de Zepwell.${prompt}
  8765: |-
    Je n'aurais jamais pensé que Gumbah...
    Et dire que nous avons pu lui mettre une pression supplémentaire sans même le savoir.${prompt}
  8766: Il est temps de mettre fin à l'ère où un seul Galka garde l'histoire ancienne.${prompt}
  8767: Il est temps que nous commencions à travailler à la création d'une nouvelle histoire ici, à Bastok.${prompt}

    Ah, te voilà enfin.
    Maintenant, laisse-moi t’informer de ta prochaine mission. Il existe un type de sel rare qui ne peut être trouvé que dans la région de Vollbow.${prompt}
  8824: J’aimerais que tu me rapportes un peu de ce sodium succulent.${prompt}
  8825: |-
    Monsieur !
    Vous n’êtes pas encore en train d’envoyer nos loyaux citoyens en mission pour obtenir des objets personnels, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8826: Je ne peux pas le permettre. Il faut tracer une ligne entre les affaires personnelles et les affaires de l’État !${prompt}
  8827: Surveille ton langage, soldat ! Comment un simple Mousquetaire ose-t-il remettre en question mon jugement !${prompt}
  8828: Je pense uniquement au bien-être des citoyens de la République… De plus, le budget pour cette mission a déjà été approuvé par le Sénat.${prompt}
  8829: Le bien-être des citoyens ? Les réserves de sel gemme de notre nation sont abondantes. Nous n’en avons pas besoin de plus. Si vous voulez vous concentrer sur le bien-être des citoyens, occupez-vous davantage de ceux qui meurent de faim dans le quartier des Mines !${prompt}
  8830: Si vous avez assez de gils dans le budget pour financer une mission aussi insensée, pourquoi ne pas utiliser une partie de cet argent pour améliorer la production des moulins de Konschtat ?${prompt}
  8831: Calme-toi, Iron Eater.${prompt}
  8832: |-
    Gumbah ?
    Pourquoi es-tu ici ?${prompt}
  8833: Oh, je suis juste venu remercier un ami.${prompt}
  8834: Que fait un petit Galka sale dans le bureau du Président ?${prompt}
  8835: |-
    Petit Galka sale !?
    Tu ne sais rien de ce qui s’est passé dans le quartier des Mines ?${prompt}
  8836: |-
    Cela n’a pas d’importance, Iron Eater.
    Sénateur Alois, ce sel dont vous parlez – si je ne me trompe pas, il s’appelle ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. J’ai entendu beaucoup de choses sur cet assaisonnement.${prompt}
  8837: Par exemple, qu’il peut ralentir les aiguilles du vieillissement sur l’horloge de la vie.${prompt}
  8838: |-
    Exactement.
    À mon âge, je dois penser à ma santé…${prompt}
  8839: Je savais que vous ne pensiez qu’à vous…${prompt}
  8840: |-
    Ahem.
    J’ai entendu dire que la zone où on le trouve est extrêmement dangereuse. Par conséquent, plutôt que de risquer la vie d’aventuriers moins expérimentés, j’ai pensé qu’il serait dans notre meilleur intérêt d’envoyer quelqu’un de plus compétent. Disons, celui qui a vaincu le Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  8841: Je n’arrive même pas à croire ce que j’entends…${prompt}
  8842: |-
    Hmm…
    Cela semble être une excellente idée.${prompt}
  8843: Quoi… ?${prompt}
  8844: (Ne t’inquiète pas. Je sais ce que je fais.)${prompt}
  8845: De toute façon, peu importe que cela te plaise ou non. La mission a déjà été approuvée par le Sénat, et cet excellent aventurier l’a déjà acceptée.${prompt}
  8846: ${name-player}, tu dois te rendre à Rabao et obtenir plus de détails sur ta tâche auprès de Dancing Wolf. Il a déjà été envoyé pour enquêter sur l’emplacement du sel.${prompt}
  8847: Iron Eater, j’ai une faveur à te demander. Viens me voir plus tard.${prompt}
  8848: |-
    Compris…
    Je ferai confiance au jugement de notre Gardien des Récits.${prompt}
  8849: Gardien des Récits ? Ça semble si formel…${prompt}
  8850: Alors, ${name-player}, puis-je compter sur ton aide aussi ? Ne t’inquiète pas. Je ne laisserai pas cela se transformer en une simple course pour notre cher sénateur.${prompt}
  8851: 'As-tu fait inspecter ce sel par Dancing Wolf avant de me l’apporter ? Comment suis-je censé savoir si c’est vraiment du ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} si tu ne l’as pas fait vérifier ? Retourne à Rabao !${prompt}'
  8852: Ah, j’ai déjà lu le rapport de la garde à Rabao. Je suppose que tu as le sel avec toi.${prompt}
  8853: Oui… Ce sel ajoutera cinq ans de plus à ma – je veux dire, à la vie de nos citoyens.${prompt}
  8854: Cela semble merveilleux, Alois.${prompt}
  8855: Tiens, si ce n’est pas le petit protégé du président. Quel est ton affaire ici ?${prompt}
  8856: 'Je suis ravi de savoir que tu travailleras dur pour t’assurer que le ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} soit utilisé pour améliorer la vie et le bien-être des citoyens de Bastok.${prompt}'
  8857: Si je découvre que ce n’est pas le cas, je t’enverrai une facture couvrant toutes les dépenses, à ton entreprise.${prompt}
  8858: Hm ? Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles.${prompt}
  8859: J’ai appris que les fonds reçus pour cette mission et les recherches supplémentaires sur le sel ont été déposés sur l’un des comptes de tes entreprises.${prompt}
  8860: Si les résultats de tes recherches sont bénéfiques pour la République de Bastok, je suis sûr que personne n’aura de problème avec ce petit détail. Cependant, s’il s’avère que rien n’est ressorti de cette mission, tu seras sommé de rembourser rapidement tous les gils que tu as reçus… plus les intérêts.${prompt}
  8861: Mais tu devrais déjà savoir tout cela. Cela a été annoncé lors de la réunion du Sénat le mois dernier… Oh, attends, si je me souviens bien, tu dormais pendant la moitié de la session.${prompt}
  8862: Comment… comment oses-tu !${prompt}
  8863: Et si tu envisages de faire pression sur les enquêteurs de cette affaire, tu ferais mieux de reconsidérer. Je dirigerai personnellement l’équipe.${prompt}
  8864: 'Enfin, un conseil pour toi, sénateur. Si tu veux vraiment vivre plus longtemps, tu devrais réduire ta consommation de ${item-plural: 6[2]}.${prompt}'
  8865: Mais, je… je…${prompt}
  8866: |-
    Et je suppose que c’est tout.
    Mais comment Gumbah savait-il ce que le sénateur mijotait vraiment… ?${prompt}
  8867: |-
    Eh bien, je suppose que cela ne nous concerne pas.
    Je te félicite pour la complétion de cette mission. Tu seras informé lorsque tes services seront à nouveau requis.${prompt}
  8868: Cependant, nous pourrions avoir besoin de tes services plus tôt que prévu.${prompt}
  8869: Il semble que l’un de nos aventuriers ait été attaqué lors d’une enquête dans les Terres du Nord…${prompt}
  8870: Les jeunes politiciens de nos jours n’ont aucun respect pour leurs aînés ! De mon temps…${prompt}
  8871: |-
    Ma Dame !
    Je ne vous permettrai pas de vous échapper de vos appartements une nouvelle fois, et je ne laisserai certainement pas d’aventuriers entrer ici.${prompt}
  8872: Oh, ${name-player}. C’est mon père qui t’a envoyé, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8873: |-
    Le président !
    Je… je m’excuse. Veuillez entrer…${prompt}
  8874: |-
    Attendez…
    Ma Dame ! Je n’ai pas entendu parler de réunions avec des aventuriers ! Vous m’avez trompé !
    Ma Dame !${prompt}
  8875: Franziska veut bien faire, mais elle devrait se détendre un peu, tu ne trouves pas ?${prompt}
  8876: Bref, tu ne devineras jamais qui était ici il y a juste quelques jours.${prompt}
  8877: Je n’arrive pas à croire que mon père l’ait même laissé s’approcher de cet endroit…${prompt}
  8878: Gumbah. Gumbah est venu ici, dans ma chambre. Il n’a rien dit pendant les premières minutes, mais quand il a ouvert la bouche, les premiers mots qu’il a prononcés étaient « merci ».${prompt}
  8879: |-
    « Merci. »
    Qu’est-ce qu’il voulait dire ? Je n’ai rien fait qui mérite des remerciements. Je n’ai fait que lui causer de la douleur et des problèmes.${prompt}
  8880: Pour quelqu’un qui a vécu plus de deux cents ans, il n’est pas très doué pour exprimer ses sentiments. Mais, tu sais, je suis plutôt contente qu’il m’ait dit ce qu’il a dit…${prompt}
  8881: Je ne suis sur Vana’diel que depuis un dixième du temps qu’il y a passé, alors je ne peux pas vraiment parler de savoir bien exprimer mes sentiments…${prompt}
  8882: Bref, une fois la glace brisée, nous avons commencé à parler de toutes sortes de choses.${prompt}
  8883: Pour une raison quelconque, il semblait vraiment intéressé par l’un des nouveaux programmes de Lucius. Je me demande ce que ça cachait ?${prompt}
  8884: |-
    Ma Dame !
    Il est temps pour vos études !${prompt}
  8885: Oui, Franziska ! Je sais !${prompt}
  8886: Tu sais, je pense que je vais commencer à mettre un peu plus d’efforts dans mes études. Je crois que je sais enfin ce que je veux devenir quand je serai plus grand.${prompt}
  8887: Ce que je veux devenir ? Je ne peux pas encore te le dire. C’est encore un secret.${prompt}
  8888: Eh bien, tu devrais probablement partir avant que Franziska ne demande à Iron Eater de te traîner dehors. Merci d’être venu et de m’avoir écouté.${prompt}
  8889: Récemment, Dame Cornelia s’est prise d’intérêt pour ses études. Cependant, je ne sais pas combien de temps cela durera…${prompt}
  8890: Nous t’attendions, ${name-player}. Des événements incroyables se sont produits récemment…${prompt}
  8891: Il semble que le chevalier noir Zeid ait attaqué l’un de nos aventuriers dans les Terres du Nord et l’ait forcé à livrer une lettre adressée au Capitaine Volker.${prompt}
  8892: Encore plus incroyable est le contenu de cette lettre…${prompt}
  8893: Mais assez parlé. Nous devrions entrer dans le bureau du Président maintenant.${prompt}
  8894: Que signifie tout cela !?${prompt}
  8895: Donne-moi une bonne raison pour laquelle vous avez été obligés de cacher la vérité sur ce que mon oncle a fait il y a plus de trente ans !${prompt}
  8896: |-
    Volker…
    Nous n’essayions pas de te le cacher…${prompt}
  8897: |-
    Attends…
    Tu étais au courant de ça aussi ?${prompt}
  8898: Au courant de… ? Eh bien… tu vois…${prompt}
  8899: Oh, et la prochaine chose que tu vas me dire, c’est que ${name-player} était aussi au courant de tout ça !${prompt}
  8900: Donc, la seule personne qui ne savait rien, c’est celle qui a du sang maudit coulant dans ses veines ! Moi !${prompt}
  8901: C’est tout ce que tu as, Raogrimm !?${prompt}
  8902: Ulrich, pourquoi !?${prompt}
  8903: Pourquoi ? Parce que je ne t’ai jamais aimé, voilà pourquoi !${prompt}
  8904: Tu ne t’en sortiras jamais comme ça, Ulrich !${prompt}
  8905: Regarde-moi bien !
  8906: '…Cornelia !?${prompt}'
  8907: Qu-qu’est-ce que j’ai fait !?${prompt}
  8908: Je n’ai pas rejoint les Mousquetaires à cause de mon oncle, mais ça n’a pas empêché les rumeurs – les rumeurs selon lesquelles c’est l’influence de mon oncle qui m’a obtenu ma position.${prompt}
  8909: Et donc, j’ai été promu Mousquetaire de Mithril, puis capitaine… et qu’est-ce qui m’attendait quand j’ai enfin atteint le sommet ? La vérité sur mon oncle et son camouflage ! Qui suis-je censé croire maintenant !?${prompt}
  8910: '…As-tu fini de te plaindre, Capitaine ?${prompt}'
  8911: Quoi… ?${prompt}
  8912: La seule raison pour laquelle nous ne t’avons pas informé de ce qui s’est passé il y a trente ans, c’est parce que nous pensions que tu réagirais comme ça.${prompt}
  8913: |-
    Et regarde-toi… Exactement ce à quoi nous nous attendions.
    Ou peut-être veux-tu que nous nous asseyions avec toi pour pleurer sur ton destin maudit ?${prompt}
  8914: Veux-tu que nous te réconfortions et te disions que ce qui s’est passé il y a trente ans n’a rien à voir avec le présent ? Est-ce que ça te fera te sentir mieux ?${prompt}
  8915: On dirait que j’ai surestimé tes capacités en tant que capitaine, Volker.${prompt}
  8916: Karst ! Ce n’était pas nécessaire !${prompt}
  8917: Tu n’as plus aucune valeur pour Bastok. Iron Eater prendra ta place jusqu’à ce que nous nommions un nouveau capitaine. Maintenant, quitte ce bureau.${prompt}
  8918: Président Karst !${prompt}
  8919: Et pendant que tu es parti, pourquoi ne pas essayer de trouver Zeid et le ramener à Bastok ? Il serait bien plus utile ici que toi.${prompt}
  8920: |-
    Compris.
    J’obéirai à vos ordres.${prompt}
  8921: Capitaine !${prompt}
  8922: Tout est… Tout est de ma faute. J’aurais dû lui dire il y a longtemps…${prompt}
  8923: Hmph ! S’il ne peut pas gérer ça, alors il ne peut certainement pas gérer le poste de capitaine.${prompt}
  8924: ${name-player} ! Tu as entendu ce qui vient de se passer ici. J’ai le sentiment que la lettre de Zeid n’était qu’un stratagème pour pousser Volker à le rencontrer.${prompt}
  8925: Cependant, vu son état, je ne suis pas certain que Volker soit prêt à relever le défi de Zeid.${prompt}
  8926: Mais nous ne pouvons pas attendre que Volker accepte la vérité qui se trouve devant lui. C’est pourquoi je te demande d’aller capturer le chevalier noir et de le ramener ici.${prompt}
  8927: Que je le nomme remplaçant de Volker ou que je le jette en prison, c’est à moi de décider.${prompt}
  8928: Président Karst ! Vous ne pouvez pas faire ça ! Pensez à ce que les deux ont fait pour ce pays !${prompt}
  8929: C’est vrai, Karst ! Tu n’es pas du genre à laisser tes sentiments guider tes actions !${prompt}
  8930: |-
    J’ai…
    J’ai donné mes ordres et je ne me répéterai pas.${prompt}
  8931: Zeid est très populaire parmi nos soldats. C’est pourquoi je ne peux pas permettre que cette enquête soit dirigée par les Mousquetaires.${prompt}
  8932: |-
    ${name-player}…
    Tu as réussi à vaincre le Seigneur des Ombres. Je te confie cette prochaine tâche.${prompt}
  8933: Maintenant, va-t’en. Ta destination est le Château Zvahl !${prompt}
  8934: Bienvenue de retour du Château Zvahl. Tu peux entrer.${prompt}
  8935: Maintenant que vous êtes tous là, j’ai une seule question à poser… Pourquoi vous, les Mousquetaires de Mithril, ne pouvez-vous jamais suivre les ordres !?${prompt}
  8936: Je pensais t’avoir dit de ramener Zeid ici à Bastok !${prompt}
  8937: Et parce que tu n’as pas pu accomplir une simple tâche, que suis-je censé faire ? Réintégrer cet échec de soldat en tant que capitaine !?${prompt}
  8938: Président Karst…${prompt}
  8939: |-
    J’en ai assez entendu. Quittez mon bureau.
    Trouvez une récompense appropriée pour l’aventurier.${prompt}
  8940: Penses-tu que le président est en colère à cause de nous ?${prompt}
  8941: Tu as tout compris à l’envers, Naji. Je ne l’ai pas vu aussi heureux depuis des lustres.${prompt}
  8942: Ha ha. Cet homme n’a jamais su montrer ses vrais sentiments.${prompt}
  8943: Je pensais que nous serions punis plus sévèrement…${prompt}
  8944: Oh, ne vous inquiétez pas, monsieur. Connaissant le président, je suis sûr que nous allons avoir une réduction de salaire, ou quelque chose du genre.${prompt}
  8945: Une réduction de salaire !? Allez ! J’ai encore seize paiements à faire sur mon prêt…${prompt}
  8946: Ne me dis pas que tu as acheté une autre épée…${prompt}
  8947: Je… Je ne sais pas comment vous remercier tous.${prompt}
  8948: Je ne pourrai jamais être Zeid. Je n’ai pas la force de porter les fardeaux qu’il porte.${prompt}
  8949: Cependant, j’ai réalisé qu’il y a certaines choses que moi seul peux accomplir.${prompt}
  8950: S’il y a beaucoup de vérités qu’on peut voir à l’intérieur des frontières d’une nation, il y a certaines choses qu’on ne peut voir qu’une fois qu’on a quitté sa terre natale.${prompt}
  8951: C’est pourquoi des aventuriers comme toi sont d’une grande importance pour notre pays.${prompt}
  8952: 'Voici ta récompense, ${name-player}. Et avec cela, je te remets le plus grand honneur de notre nation : le rang 10.${prompt}'
  8953: Je ne peux même pas compter le nombre de fois où je t’ai remercié pour tes services, mais… merci.${prompt}
  8954: Certains ${choice-player-gender}[gars/filles] ont vraiment de la chance… Toi ? Tu reçois une récompense. Moi ? J’ai une réduction de salaire !${prompt}
  8955: Oh, j’ai failli oublier. Il y a une lettre pour toi.${prompt}
  8956: Tiens. Tu sauras de qui elle vient en la lisant.${prompt}
  8957: |-
    Cher ${name-player},${wait-36: 1}
    « Aimes-tu vraiment Bastok ? »${prompt}
  8958: |-
    Je…
    Je détestais mon pays.${prompt}
  8959: |-
    Un pays gouverné par les gils…
    Un pays où les gens ne se préoccupent que d’eux-mêmes…${prompt}
  8960: J’ai essayé de le changer, mais avec chaque jour qui passait, j’en suis venu à penser que peut-être j’étais vraiment impuissant face au système.${prompt}
  8961: Mais récemment, j’ai rencontré beaucoup de personnes différentes, et j’ai réalisé que je n’étais pas aussi impuissant que je le pensais.${prompt}
  8962: 'Et c’est pourquoi j’ai décidé d’écouter la voix du peuple et de leur demander : « Aimes-tu vraiment Bastok ? »${prompt}'
  8963: En fait, j’ai déjà commencé à poser la question. Voici ce qu’ils avaient à dire…${prompt}
  8964: Tu poses vraiment les questions les plus étranges, Cornelia.${prompt}
  8965: |-
    Hmm, eh bien…
    Je n’ai pas eu une vie facile ici à Bastok, mais je ne pense pas que j’aurais pu poursuivre mon rêve ailleurs.${prompt}
  8966: 'Ça peut sembler étrange, mais être dans ce pays te donne la confiance de dire à tout le monde : « Je vais vous montrer ! »${prompt}'
  8967: Bien sûr. Je suis fier de dire que je suis né et que j’ai grandi à Bastok.${prompt}
  8968: Même si nous sommes entourés de malms de désert, je peux toujours obtenir tous les ingrédients dont j’ai besoin pour les repas de ma famille.${prompt}
  8969: Je pense que cela ne peut venir que de la liberté sur laquelle cette nation est fondée.${prompt}
  8970: Certains peuvent critiquer les façons avides d’argent des marchands et des aventuriers, mais sans eux, où en serait Bastok aujourd’hui ?${prompt}
  8971: Mon seul problème, c’est d’essayer de décider quoi faire pour le dîner. Je dirais que c’est une vie plutôt insouciante.${prompt}
  8972: Quelle question idiote ! Comment pourrais-je aimer un pays où les Humes nous ont piétinés, nous les Galka, pendant des centaines d’années !?${prompt}
  8973: Le pont entre nos peuples ne peut pas être construit en un jour. Mais si nous n’essayons pas, les esprits de nos ancêtres ne pourront jamais reposer en paix.${prompt}
  8974: Tout le monde sait que nous devons changer nos façons de faire, mais c’est souvent plus facile à dire qu’à faire.${prompt}
  8975: Aimer, détester… Est-ce que ça a vraiment de l’importance ?${prompt}
  8976: Mais quand les gens essaient de vivre leur vie sans respecter les règles qui ont été établies avant eux, il y a forcément des problèmes.${prompt}
  8977: Je suppose que c’est ce qu’on appelle la « responsabilité ». Tu sais, ce mot n’était pas beaucoup utilisé par les anciens Galka.${prompt}
  8978: Personne ne remettait vraiment en question la responsabilité du Gardien des Récits, tout comme personne ne remet en question la responsabilité des dieux.${prompt}
  8979: Si tu vas tout laisser entre les mains d’une seule personne, la responsabilité devient obsolète. Cependant, si tu essaies de vivre en communauté…${prompt}
  8980: Maintenant, si toi aussi tu commençais à prendre un peu de responsabilité…${prompt}
  8981: Hé, tu n’as pas besoin de te mettre dans cet état… !${prompt}
  8982: Si je n’avais aucun attachement pour ce pays, je serais probablement encore en train de perfectionner mes compétences à Norg…${prompt}
  8983: Mais je sens que c’est mon devoir de protéger cette nation. Ça peut sembler simple, mais c’est ce qui me motive.${prompt}
  8984: Je voulais juste un endroit où je pourrais mener mes expériences…${prompt}
  8985: Je n’aurais jamais pensé qu’ils me rendraient si important. Ha ha.${prompt}
  8986: La seule chose dont j’ai besoin dans la vie, c’est l’opportunité de rendre quelque chose au peuple…${prompt}
  8987: Bien sûr, j’aime Bastok. Où ailleurs un gars comme moi pourrait devenir Mousquetaire ? C’est la terre des opportunités !${prompt}
  8988: Maintenant, s’ils pouvaient juste réduire mes heures et m’accorder une augmentation, je pourrais être l’étoile de l’espoir pour tous les petits enfants de la nation…${prompt}
  8989: Tant que l’ennemi rôde à l’extérieur, la bataille pour défendre cette nation doit continuer. Et tant que la bataille continue, le travail des officiels comme moi ne s’arrêtera jamais.${prompt}
  8990: Je ne pense pas que nous verrons un jour un Bastok parfait, mais cela ne signifie pas que nous devons arrêter d’essayer d’en construire un.${prompt}
  8991: Le jour où l’on peut exprimer ses vrais sentiments pour son pays est le jour où ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] réalise quel est ${choice-player-gender}[son/sa] véritable rôle là-bas.${prompt}
  8992: Avec Messire Zeid absent, je n’ai jamais pris le temps de réfléchir à quel était mon rôle…${prompt}
  8993: Mais maintenant, j’ai enfin compris ce que je dois faire, et je me sens un peu plus près de pouvoir exprimer mes vrais sentiments à propos de Bastok.${prompt}
  8994: Qu-qu’est-ce que c’est censé vouloir dire !? Maintenant, arrête de poser des questions stupides et retourne dans ta chambre pour étudier !${prompt}
  8995: J’aime ce pays du fond de mon cœur. Partager la douleur, et la joie…${prompt}
  8996: Nier la douleur et la faire porter à un autre ne peut qu’engendrer plus de douleur, et la joie ne sera jamais atteinte.${prompt}
  8997: La douleur que j’ai endurée est celle de tous les citoyens de Bastok, et je continuerai mon combat jusqu’à ce que cette douleur se transforme en bonheur.${prompt}
  8998: 'Quant à moi… eh bien, je ne sais pas si je peux répondre pour l’instant, mais je sais une chose : il y a encore beaucoup à apprendre sur ce pays.${prompt}'
  8999: Et peut-être qu’un jour je pourrai devenir quelqu’un qui représentera le peuple et apportera du changement à Bastok. Peut-être même que je deviendrai… Attends. Je vais garder ça secret.${prompt}
  9000: Regarde juste le Capitaine Volker. Comparé à son oncle, il a accompli tellement de choses. S’il a pu le faire…${prompt}
  9001: Je m’excuse pour mes divagations. Je veux te remercier encore pour tout ce que tu as fait.${prompt}
  9002: Combattre pour notre nation, vaincre le Seigneur des Ombres… tes exploits ont tellement bénéficié à Bastok.${prompt}
  9003: Cependant, en plus de cela, tu nous as donné quelque chose de plus important.${prompt}
  9004: Tu nous as appris ce qui nous manquait. Je comprends maintenant l’importance de partager notre joie autant que notre douleur, et je travaillerai dur pour m’assurer de ne jamais l’oublier.${prompt}
  9005: "À bientôt, ${name-player}…\n \n                     Cornelia${prompt}"
  9006: J’ai entendu les rumeurs, ${name-player}. On dit que peu de gens peuvent égaler ta technique à la hache de guerre.${prompt}
  9007: Que dirais-tu de tester tes limites ? Tiens, prends cette hache et mets-toi à l’épreuve.${prompt}
  9008: 'Quand tu sentiras que cette arme ne peut plus t’emmener plus loin, rapporte-la-moi avec ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  9009: Quelque chose ne va pas ? Tu abandonnes si facilement ?${prompt}
  9010: |-
    What is wrong?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nothing.
    I've lost the axe.
    I've decided to give up.${prompt}
  9011: |-
    And you call yourself an adventurer. You should learn to take better care of your property!
    Here, take this axe, and be more careful this time.${prompt}
  9012: Give up? After coming this far?${prompt}
  9013: |-
    Do you really want to give up?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not just yet.${prompt}
  9014: |-
    I see you were not ready for the task I offered you...
    Do what you wish with that axe. I have no need for it.${prompt}
  9015: Your journey is not yet over, ${name-player}. There are still many roads that this axe has to lead you down.${prompt}
  9016: So, the axe has finally recognized your true ability.${prompt}
  9017: However, your journey is not yet over. Take this and travel to the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. There a great beast awaits you.${prompt}
  9018: 'Defeat that beast and retrieve from it ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} as proof of your victory.${prompt}'
  9019: Hmph... Your eyes are asking me why you must do something so tedious.${prompt}
  9020: |-
    I remember giving my master the same look when he asked me to perform this task many years ago.
    The answer to your question can only be realized by defeating that beast...${prompt}
  9021: 'I see you have brought back the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}...${prompt}'
  9022: Ten years ago, before I became a Mythril Musketeer, I, too, defeated the beast and brought back that same item as proof of my deed. Just as my master had ordered me...${prompt}
  9023: Master, I do not feel that this axe is suited for me. I wish to continue my training in the way of the great sword.${prompt}
  9024: |-
    Pagdako...
    Rushing into decisions can only hamper your potential.${prompt}
  9025: That axe has shown you your limits, and has led you to reevaluate the paths you have chosen.${prompt}
  9026: |-
    Whether or not you attempt to break those limits is up to you. Only you can decide which roads in life you will tread.
    This is all I can teach you...${prompt}
  9027: Master!${prompt}
  9028: Believe in yourself and your abilities, Pagdako. A new force is growing inside you as we speak...${prompt}
  9029: 'I sensed that you, too, had begun to realize your limits. However, by fighting with that foe, a new force has begun to grow inside of you. These ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} are just a symbol of that force.${prompt}'
  9030: Step forth, and wield your axe with confidence, knowing that the path you have chosen has not ended. There is still much to learn...${prompt}
  9031: You have learned the weapon skill “Steel Cyclone”!${prompt}
  9032: Oh, ${name-player}. You're just the person I wanted to see. I've heard a lot about your skill with firearms.${prompt}
  9033: I want you to try out this new weapon we've invented. It's a mighty fine piece of work, if you ask me.${prompt}
  9034: 'Oh, I almost forgot the owner''s manual. Here it is...the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}...? Who on Vana''diel gave it that name? Raibaht?${prompt}'
  9035: |-
    Well, he never did have that much in the way of imagination.
    Anyway, this lady's guaranteed to last until your grandchildren are clubbing Quadav. But if it ever stops shooting straight, bring it back to me. I'll fix her right up.${prompt}
  9036: What's wrong? My weapon didn't backfire on you, did it?${prompt}
  9037: |-
    Why are you here?
    ${selection-lines}
    No particular reason.
    I've lost the gun...
    I've had enough...${prompt}
  9038: |-
    What do you mean, “lost it”? You know that guns are for shooting, not for throwing, right?
    Oh well. Take this as a replacement, but be more careful next time!${prompt}
  9039: What are you talking about? We were just starting to get somewhere!${prompt}
  9040: |-
    You don't really want to quit, do you?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I do.
    No, not really.${prompt}
  9041: |-
    Give up? Hey, it's not like I'm asking you to save the world or anything.
    <Sigh> Well, I can't force you to do anything you don't want to... But you get rid of the gun yourself, all right?${prompt}
  9042: Wait a minute, this baby still has a few more rounds in her. Take her back to the battlefield and do some more damage, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9043: So she's fired her last shot... I guess we'll have to work on improving this test model before we can start manufacturing.${prompt}
  9044: Chief, that weapon is not a test model.${prompt}
  9045: Not a test model? What do you mean, Raibaht? Come on, spill it.${prompt}
  9046: I designed that gun to be used in training exercises.${prompt}
  9047: Oh, you mean this is one of the guns we were asked to develop for... I'm sorry, ${name-player}. I seem to have given you the wrong weapon.${prompt}
  9048: While I say “training exercises,” you must know that I do not refer to the training of novices. In theory, only the top marksmen should be able to handle the power of that rifle. Which means...${prompt}
  9049: Ha ha! This is perfect! We can shoot two birds with one bullet, so to speak.${prompt}
  9050: '${name-player}, I need you to go and find me ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  9051: Maybe we can use that to help train our army's soldiers.${prompt}
  9052: I've heard stories about it being hidden somewhere in the Boyahda Tree. You'll go get it for us, right?${prompt}
  9053: 'You''re back with the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}! Here, let me take a look at her...${prompt}'
  9054: Hmmm... So that's what we've been missing...${prompt}
  9055: |-
    When I was young, I used to be quite the marksman myself. However, too many hours in the lab has led me to forget all that I learned back then...
    I want to thank you for helping me to realize that, ${name-player}. The least I can do is teach you the technique described in the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}
  9056: You have learned the weapon skill “Detonator”!${prompt}
  9057: What're you doing in here?${prompt}
  9058: Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you. I'm waiting for someone.${prompt}
  9059: I have come, as per our agreement.${prompt}
  9060: Uh, now is not a good time. Can you come back later?${prompt}
  9061: You were the one who called me here, were you not?${prompt}
  9062: |-
    You're...
    Viresefilant...?${prompt}
  9063: |-
    Ayame?
    Long has it been since our paths last crossed. You are now a Mythril Musketeer, if I'm not mistaken?${prompt}
  9064: I was fortunate, that is all.${prompt}
  9065: There is no need to rub my nose in it, Ayame.${prompt}
  9066: That's not what I--${prompt}
  9067: Out of my way. I have better things to do.${prompt}
  9068: You know that guy?${prompt}
  9069: |-
    Yes...
    We trained together in Norg.${prompt}
  9070: We promised to always lend each other strength when the path became too hard to travel.${prompt}
  9071: I thought he would've been glad to see I had become a Mythril Musketeer...${prompt}
  9072: |-
    Well, people change. Maybe he just forgot about those times.
    You shouldn't beat yourself up over it.${prompt}
  9073: Anyway, what can I do for you? I'm kinda busy over here...${prompt}
  9074: In that case, it can wait. We'll speak later.${prompt}
  9075: Adventurer, I need to have a word with you. Could you come to the Northern Cannonry?${prompt}
  9076: I apologize for all the mystery...${prompt}
  9077: '...but I needed to speak with you in private.${prompt}'
  9078: You see...${prompt}
  9079: I have a request for you from a senator.${prompt}
  9080: He claims to have been receiving threats.${prompt}
  9081: Every day there have been mountains of incoherent, slanderous letters arriving at the President's Office. So many, in fact, the herald delivering these threats, rather than the senator himself, has collapsed from the strain.${prompt}
  9082: Now we have Naji delivering the mail, if you can imagine it.${prompt}
  9083: This interruption to our duties, not to mention Naji's complaining, has become intolerable. So I did some investigating. From the letters, I was able to discover the identity of the writer and negotiate a meeting at the Tenshodo here in Bastok. However...${prompt}
  9084: |-
    There is one small problem.
    The letter writer won't meet with anyone unless they bring a certain diary.${prompt}
  9085: This diary is supposedly hidden somewhere within the Palborough Mines. I have no idea why it would be there.${prompt}
  9086: The Mythril Mousquetaires are far too busy with more pressing matters to conduct a search of the mines, and we certainly can't expect the senator to go in our stead.${prompt}
  9087: |-
    This is where you come in.
    Would you be willing to take this task upon yourself?${prompt}
  9088: |-
    Will you perform this task?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure, the mines are like my second home.
    I also have more pressing matters...${prompt}
  9089: |-
    I cannot entrust this task to anyone else.
    Please let me know if you change your mind.${prompt}
  9090: This is not only about the diary. You will also be required to eliminate the letter writer. I am sure your skills in combat will be tested before this matter has been put to rest.${prompt}
  9091: Show the diary to Kagetora, and he will tell you where the author of these threatening letters can be found. I leave the “negotiations” to your discretion.${prompt}
  9092: |-
    Ah, yes.
    Please do not mention any of this to Romualdo.${prompt}
  9093: Senator Alois has his suspicions.${prompt}
  9094: Apparently Romualdo has been seen in the company of some strange character as of late.${prompt}
  9095: But putting aside these speculations, there is reason to believe that someone has been providing the letter writer with information.${prompt}
  9096: It is unlikely that the writer is in direct contact with an employee of the President's Office, so I assume there must be a messenger of some sort.${prompt}
  9097: I want you to find out the identity of this messenger as well.${prompt}
  9098: |-
    Viresefilant...?
    What is going on here?
    I must speak with Senator Alois...${prompt}
  9099: What business does an adventurer have with me?${prompt}
  9100: |-
    Is that so?
    How strange, I have no memory of making any such request. The next time you see Ayame, you tell her to keep my name out of her affairs.${prompt}
  9101: Senator Alois, forgive this interruption, but there is something I need to spe--${prompt}
  9102: Can't I get any peace around here?${prompt}
  9103: Please explain to me about this new assassin group.${prompt}
  9104: Assassa-whatsits? What in Vana'diel are you babbling about?${prompt}
  9105: Save the act, Senator. Kagetora of the Tenshodo told me everything.${prompt}
  9106: Creating this fictitious “assassin” organization to lure adventurers into doing your dirty work is an abuse of power.${prompt}
  9107: I did no such thing. I just mentioned the rumor that an assassin group might exist. It's not my fault if they took things the wrong way.${prompt}
  9108: |-
    What are you trying to say exactly?
    That I have to take responsibility for other people's misunderstandings now, hmmm?${prompt}
  9109: I am already in a position of responsibility.${prompt}
  9110: I have eliminated the objective as per your orders, Senator.${prompt}
  9111: '...!!!${prompt}'
  9112: |-
    Ah! Good work, good work.
    You have carried out my request to shut up that big-mou...I mean, remove that menace to our nation most admirably.${prompt}
  9113: From now on, please inform me in advance when you intend to make a report.${prompt}
  9114: Does this mean I have been accepted into the assassins?${prompt}
  9115: There must be some sort of mistake.${prompt}
  9116: I don't know anything about any “assassins.”${prompt}
  9117: What makes you think that I would be able to authorize something like that in the first place? I believe you've taken some of my previous comments in entirely the wrong light. In the future, pay a little more attention to the details.${prompt}
  9118: And did you find out who the messenger was? I specifically ordered you to discover who was running the information back and forth.${prompt}
  9119: You expect to receive a reward when you haven't even completed your assignment? I have no patience for this kind of unprofessionalism. Get back out there at once!${prompt}
  9120: If you have any complaints, kindly make them after you have brought me the messenger!${prompt}
  9121: Senator!${prompt}
  9122: |-
    Guards!
    There is an unwelcome guest in the President's Office. Remove him immediately.${prompt}
  9123: '...${prompt}'
  9124: "Honestly, the number of ill-mannered hireswords these days just makes my head ache. \nAre you still here? Be on your way, adventurer.${prompt}"
  9125: |-
    What is the meaning of this, Senator?
    That exchange appeared to be more than just a simple “misunderstanding.”
    You promised him a position as an assassin, didn't you?${prompt}
  9126: Your actions in this matter are reprehensible. You enlisted his services because of his exceptional skill, correct?${prompt}
  9127: That level of ability is not something gained over a weekend training session. Do you have any idea of the sweat and tears one must go through to attain such perfection!?${prompt}
  9128: What is that to me?${prompt}
  9129: |-
    Well, I know exactly what he has gone through.
    The toil and the blisters of constant practice. Swinging a katana until his arm was numb from the strain. Encouraging others to push on, even though he himself was ready to drop.${prompt}
  9130: Even if I don't know everything about him, I know that much. You will apologize for manipulating him and making a mockery of his effort.${prompt}
  9131: '...${prompt}'
  9132: Senator...${prompt}
  9133: Huh...?${prompt}
  9134: I've had about enough of your lecturing. If you're done whining, I'm sure you have other duties to attend to. Now get out!${prompt}
  9135: |-
    If that is the way it must be.
    I'll take my leave.${prompt}
  9136: ${name-player}, would you accompany me, please?${prompt}
  9137: |-
    I suppose you're thinking of crying to the president about this?
    What a pity he's far too busy to make time for the likes of you.${prompt}
  9138: I am a patient woman...${prompt}
  9139: |-
    Guards!
    This adventurer is to be banned from entering the Metalworks, effective immediately!${prompt}
  9140: Your methods lack subtlety.${prompt}
  9141: Who asked for your opinion!? Get out!${prompt}
  9142: Senator Alois, could you spare a moment?${prompt}
  9143: Who is this man?${prompt}
  9144: This is the messenger you've been searching for.${prompt}
  9145: |-
    Please forgive me.
    I was the one who tricked Romualdo into revealing sensitive information about you, sir.${prompt}
  9146: Seems he was ready to sell information to other citizens who hold grudges against you as well. We were lucky this business was restricted to just one malcontent.${prompt}
  9147: |-
    Unbelievable.
    Well then, lad, excellent work. I'll be able to sleep much easier tonight.${prompt}
  9148: That's the kind of efficiency I've come to expect from the Mythril Mousquetaires.${prompt}
  9149: Actually, it wasn't me who caught him, sir. It was the man you ordered me to remove from the office a little while ago.${prompt}
  9150: Sir, you did mention you would hear what he had to say if he brought you the messenger. You really should listen to him.${prompt}
  9151: The thing is, though, he's already left the Republic. Fed up with the treatment he's received, I'd imagine. So I'll do his talking for him.${prompt}
  9152: There was only one thing he wished to say to you.${prompt}
  9153: “Be ashamed of your actions.”${prompt}
  9154: How dare a simple citizen speak that way to a senator!${prompt}
  9155: |-
    We-ell...
    I suppose it's about time I took this fellow before the president and had him confess to his crimes. You don't mind, do you? After all, it is my duty.${prompt}
  9156: |-
    President Karst is so intimidating...
    I'd just break down and tell him everything.${prompt}
  9157: I...${prompt}
  9158: '...All right. I will never do anything like this again. I swear it.${prompt}'
  9159: Ayame, got a minute?${prompt}
  9160: There was one more message I had to deliver.${prompt}
  9161: From Viresefilant?${prompt}
  9162: |-
    The promise you both made that day...
    He kept that promise to look out for you.${prompt}
  9163: He remembered...${prompt}
  9164: Okay, time for me to go. I'm no good at this sappy stuff.${prompt}
  9165: |-
    I owe my thanks to you as well.
    Please take this with my gratitude.${prompt}
  9166: May fortune smile upon your future endeavors, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9167: |-
    Bonjour, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame].
    Je fais partie du Réseau d'Aide Mutuelle des Aventuriers (RAMA) et je prends actuellement des candidatures pour de nouveaux ${color: 5}mentors${color: 1}.${prompt}
  9168: |-
    Qu'est-ce qu'un mentor, demandez-vous ?
    Eh bien, en bref, un mentor est un aventurier expérimenté qui est prêt à consacrer un peu de son temps pour aider ses compagnons moins expérimentés.${prompt}
  9169: Si cela ressemble à un emploi qui vous convient, n'hésitez pas à vous inscrire dès aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  9170: 'Pour devenir mentor, vous devez avoir complété l’objectif des Archives de l’Éminence ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}.${prompt}'
  9171: 'Accepter ${unknown: 0x01054082808080} nécessite que vous ayez plus de 180 heures de temps de jeu...${prompt}'
  9172: '...et que vous ayez complété l’objectif des Archives de l’Éminence ${unknown: 0x01054082828080}.${prompt}'
  9173: Veuillez noter que l’enregistrement et le service en tant que mentor, ainsi que l’utilisation des services du Programme de Mentor, se font à la discrétion du joueur.${prompt}
  9174: SQUARE ENIX ne pourra être tenu responsable des actions et/ou commentaires des mentors. Aucun avantage de quelque nature que ce soit ne sera fourni à ceux qui choisissent de participer au Programme de Mentor.${prompt}
  9175: En acceptant de participer au Programme de Mentor, vous reconnaissez avoir lu et compris les termes ci-dessus.${prompt}
  9176: 'Je suis désolé, mais vous ne remplissez pas les conditions nécessaires pour accepter l’objectif des Archives de l’Éminence ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}.${prompt}'
  9177: 'Veuillez me parler à nouveau une fois que vous avez accepté ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}. Je jugerai alors si vous remplissez les conditions.${prompt}'
  9178: 'Vous avez accepté ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}, oui ? Alors laissez-moi vérifier mes matériaux ici...${prompt}'
  9179: Félicitations ! Vous êtes qualifié pour être mentor !${prompt}
  9180: Mes matériaux ici indiquent que vous ne remplissez pas les conditions. Continuez comme ça !${prompt}
  9181: |-
    Would you like to serve as a mentor?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  9182: You are now a registered mentor.${prompt}
  9183: |-
    You can enable "Mentor Status" by using the command ${color: 5}/mentor on${color: 1}.
    You can disable the status by using ${color: 5}/mentor off${color: 1}.${prompt}
  9184: Mentor status can also be switched on and off in the “Config” menu found within the “Help Desk.”${prompt}
  9185: You are already a registered mentor.${prompt}
  9186: '${color-alt: 138}A new objective, ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}, has been added to Records of Eminence.'
  9187: |-
    ${name-player}!
    So you, too, have decided to join the Bastokan forces and participate in Conflict!${prompt}
  9188: Ha ha! Do not tell me you are worried about those cowards to the east or those arrogant fools to the north. They will be no match for the strength of our nation. Now let us go and report to the president.${prompt}
  9189: |-
    Sir!
    I have with me an adventurer who wishes to participate in...${prompt}
  9190: What in Altana's name was that Volker thinking!? Agreeing to the reinstatement of Conflict... Why am I forced to work with complete idiots!?${prompt}
  9191: Sir, Captain Volker was only thinking of the Republican Army when he made his decision. Conflict would give our forces a boost in morale, as well as sharpen their skills.${prompt}
  9192: And I'm saying that his way of thinking is flawed and outdated! Why waste our funds on children's games when that gil could be used to develop new weapons!${prompt}
  9193: Sir, are you saying that our country would not profit from Conflict...?${prompt}
  9194: And what would a Mythril Musketeer know about profit!? That profit is what fills your cupboards with brown bread and rocksalt.${prompt}
  9195: Don't you tell me how to run my country!  It is my job to decide what will and will not benefit this nation.${prompt}
  9196: |-
    Listen up, because I'm only going to say this once.
    Conflict is nothing but a series of war games. We are not allowed to even test our new ships or cannons.${prompt}
  9197: No! The exercises must be won with well-planned tactics. In the field of battle tactics, there isn't a nation in all of Vana'diel that can outmatch our generals. There is no reason for us to have to prove that.${prompt}
  9198: |-
    San d'Oria? Hah!
    Let them line up in their little lines and charge with their wooden spears.${prompt}
  9199: Don't forget that it wasn't only our cannons that delivered them defeat during the Battle of Konschtat.${prompt}
  9200: |-
    And Windurst? Hah!
    Those cowards don't even know how to fight! Hiding behind hired mercenaries, muttering spells doesn't win campaigns.${prompt}
  9201: It didn't work in Elshimo and it won't work this time, either! They should all just crawl up in their big tree and hibernate for the winter.${prompt}
  9202: The ages of strength and magic are over.${prompt}
  9203: San d'Oria and Windurst have the tools they need to win, but they don't have the brains to use them! Our citizens do. And that's why we will always be victorious!${prompt}
  9204: Sir, this adventurer...${prompt}
  9205: |-
    You want my approval to fight in Conflict, citizen? You have it!
    Dismissed!${prompt}
  9206: I apologize for the president's behavior. While he is vocal in his opposition to Bastok's participation in Conflict, the last thing he wishes is the Republic's defeat.${prompt}
  9207: |-
    Hmmm...
    So, you are here from ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Windurst] to receive permission to participate in Conflict?${prompt}
  9208: '...${prompt}'
  9209: |-
    ...${wait-36: 1}
    I apologize if I look shocked, but I expected more from ${choice: 0}[the once mighty lions of San d'Oria/the once mighty magicians of the Federation]...${prompt}
  9210: |-
    Well, no matter.
    Follow me. We must not keep the president waiting.${prompt}
  9211: |-
    Sir!
    I have with me an adventurer who wishes to participate in...${prompt}
  9212: |-
    I have a question for you, ${choice-player-gender}[young man/young lady].
    Why did you pledge your allegiance to ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Windurst] and not to Bastok?${prompt}
  9213: |-
    You chose ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Windurst] because of...
    ${selection-lines}
    ...its people.
    ...its culture.
    ...its city.
    ...its leader.${prompt}
  9214: |-
    Its people?
    The helpless masses whining for a hero to hold their hands when things get tough?
    The petty common folk, blind to their own worthlessness?
    Did you really think that you could be their hero?${prompt}
  9215: |-
    San d'Oria's culture?
    You mean their stubborn pride? Or perhaps the blatant ostentation found in their castles and cathedrals?
    But, tell me. Can a well-decorated chateau feed the hungry masses!?${prompt}
  9216: |-
    Windurst's culture?
    Yes, magic is good for talent shows and birthday parties, but can an incantation feed your nation's starving people!?${prompt}
  9217: |-
    Its city?
    Have you spent even a second to think of what the people of your nation had to give to build that city for its leaders? Years of sweat and blood...and for what? Can a fancy bridge or beautiful fountain feed the hungry masses!?${prompt}
  9218: |-
    San d'Oria's leader?
    You don't mean that decrepit old man who spends his days snoring on the throne, do you? Or maybe you meant those bickering brothers? Yes, all of them make wonderful leaders.${prompt}
  9219: |-
    Windurst's leader?
    Yes, I'd love to be Windurst's leader. All I'd have to do all day is hide up in my treehouse and have my maids take out the garbage.${prompt}
  9220: Oh, but don't let me tell you what is right or just.${prompt}
  9221: 'All you have to remember is that the wheels of change began turning back during the ${choice: 0}[Battle of Konschtat/Elshimo Campaign].${prompt}'
  9222: You have my permission to participate in Conflict, but don't forget that a new age is upon us, and Bastok is at the reigns.${prompt}
  9223: |-
    Of course, there's always the option of naturalization. The officers at the Department of Industry would be more than delighted to take your application.
    You're dismissed!${prompt}
  9224: |-
    What is wrong? Were you offended by what the president had to say?
    Well, I can offer you no apologies. According to my sources, your nation's leaders are just as vocal with their opinions of the Republic.
    If you have any complaints, I suggest you settle them on the battlefield.${prompt}
  9225: There is nothing out of the ordinary here.${prompt}
  9226: You hear a voice from out of nowhere...${prompt}
  9227: 'You obtain ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  9228: |-
    ...
    At last we meet.${prompt}
  9229: I have been freed from my prison and can soak up the sweat and blood of this world once more.${prompt}
  9230: Wait, there is something I must...${prompt}
  9231: This place is...?${prompt}
  9232: |-
    I see...
    You must be the new wielder for these.${prompt}
  9233: 'Yes, with your fighting spirit I believe you will be able to master the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  9234: 'The ${item-singular: 0[2]} have long accompanied me, along both rough and gentle paths. It is not easy to give them up, but...here.${prompt}'
  9235: |-
    They belong to you now. I ask that you consider my...
    Ah, but that is past now. I bid you farewell....${prompt}
  9236: '...${prompt}'
  9237: I hope you don't think this is the end.${prompt}
  9238: |-
    Your real life as a martial artist is just beginning.
    Time to start your training anew!${prompt}
  9239: |-
    ...
    Finally! We finally meet face to face!${prompt}
  9240: |-
    I have a presence in this world again!
    What an exhilarating feeling!${prompt}
  9241: Ah yes, there is one more thing...${prompt}
  9242: Eh? What?${prompt}
  9243: |-
    Oh.
    You must be this one's new owner.${prompt}
  9244: 'With your dagger skills, you''ll make a perfect wielder for the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  9245: It is most difficult to give up a weapon that has seen me through so many tight spots, but you have earned it.${prompt}
  9246: Treat her well...${prompt}
  9247: '...${prompt}'
  9248: |-
    Splendid!
    From this day forth, I belong to you.${prompt}
  9249: |-
    So, what kind of games shall we play?
    And where shall we go to play them?
    Who are we going to kill when we get there?
    It's all just too exciting...!${prompt}
  9250: |-
    ...
    Thou hast found me.${prompt}
  9251: I have now thrice shown my true form in this world.${prompt}
  9252: A moment...${prompt}
  9253: |-
    ...
    What has happened to me?${prompt}
  9254: I see, you are the sword's new owner?${prompt}
  9255: |-
    Well, this is most encouraging!
    A master of swordplay such as yourself should have no trouble wielding ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  9256: |-
    When the world lies in chaos, this blade appears before the one meant to wield it.
    It is yours...
    Restore order to Vana'diel!${prompt}
  9257: And now I, too, can rest unburdened...${prompt}
  9258: '...${prompt}'
  9259: Thou art blessed this day.${prompt}
  9260: |-
    Henceforth, I shall be thy blade.
    For the sake of thy companions, for justice in this world, wield my power in the name of honor...${prompt}
  9261: |-
    ...
    You have found me.${prompt}
  9262: |-
    Allow me to show my respect.
    You who have gained the strength of so many must be a true hero.${prompt}
  9263: But first...${prompt}
  9264: Who are you?${prompt}
  9265: |-
    This must be some sort of joke.
    You are the new wielder of this weapon?${prompt}
  9266: |-
    Hmmm, perhaps I have misjudged you.
    With your level of skill, you may be able to handle this beastly blade, and have the will to control its awesome power.${prompt}
  9267: However, this is a magical blade. It is a sword that calls upon destruction. Its malice will gnaw away at your body and soul even as you topple enemies with its strength.${prompt}
  9268: |-
    Do not forget this truth! Keep it always in your mind.
    My regards go with you, stranger...${prompt}
  9269: '...${prompt}'
  9270: Now, my heroic master...${prompt}
  9271: |-
    For what purpose will you wield my power?
    The choices before you are without limit.
    Will you become the ruler of this world? Or perhaps...${prompt}
  9272: |-
    ...
    You...me, meet.${prompt}
  9273: |-
    Me...free...
    Thanks to you. Me, your...${prompt}
  9274: Wait...${prompt}
  9275: What the...?${prompt}
  9276: |-
    Ah, now I see.
    The wheel has turned.${prompt}
  9277: |-
    Truthfully spoken, I am thankful.
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} is a splendid axe, but ever does it hunger.${prompt}
  9278: I have taken many lives to sate its need, and have reached the end of my strength.${prompt}
  9279: |-
    You have my gratitude.
    You have freed me from my nightmare, and now I can sleep with a tranquil spirit...${prompt}
  9280: '...${prompt}'
  9281: |-
    You, master, me.
    Good, work. Me, thank, you.${prompt}
  9282: |-
    Master, me, hunger.
    Go, hunt? Find, prey?
    Me, cut, flesh. Break, bone. Drink, blood.
    Master, me, hunger...${prompt}
  9283: |-
    ...
    Ah, you found me!${prompt}
  9284: |-
    I have been freed from a world where life and death, reality and illusion are impossible to tell apart.
    I am truly grateful.${prompt}
  9285: One moment...${prompt}
  9286: |-
    ...
    This is...Jeuno!?
    Have I finally returned?${prompt}
  9287: |-
    I... Nobody can see me.
    This is merely a reflection of reality.
    Which means you are the one to inherit the axe.${prompt}
  9288: 'Hmm. With your polished skills, you will make a fine master for ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  9289: The one who wields this axe must also be beautiful to look upon. Apparently, I was a suitable candidate. Do you not agree?${prompt}
  9290: |-
    Congratulations.
    I expect you to perform great deeds from this day onwards.
    I also ask that someday you use ${item-singular: 0[2]} to avenge the Hydra Corps...${prompt}
  9291: '...${prompt}'
  9292: I congratulate you also...my new master.${prompt}
  9293: |-
    Now hold me high and let my blade glint in the sunlight!
    Let your friends, as well as your enemies, feast upon my glorious beauty!${prompt}
  9294: |-
    ...
    You have found me.${prompt}
  9295: My forbidden power is now yours, and I am liberated from my prison.${prompt}
  9296: You have but to gain her respect...${prompt}
  9297: Such a long dream I was having...${prompt}
  9298: |-
    It was a dream held captive by a shrouded world.
    No. I must accept that it was no dream.${prompt}
  9299: |-
    And you? Do you seek the same darkness that I did...
    It seems you have already found your way to ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  9300: |-
    Very well, I will pass it on to you.
    But do not forget how much blood your companions spilled in your search for its unholy strength.${prompt}
  9301: And think long and hard on whether or not this power should be used. Do not end up like me...${prompt}
  9302: '...${prompt}'
  9303: |-
    Heh. Heh heh.
    Hahahahahahaha!${prompt}
  9304: |-
    Well, my new master, is it not time to begin the journey for ever greater power?
    There are enemies yet to fell, and blood yet to spill...${prompt}
  9305: |-
    ...
    You have unearthed me at last.${prompt}
  9306: I am free from Dynamis, free to fly through the heavens once more.${prompt}
  9307: All that remains is...${prompt}
  9308: |-
    Hello?
    Is it possible that I...${prompt}
  9309: |-
    But, no.
    I have not returned to this realm...
    You. You are to be my successor?${prompt}
  9310: 'You certainly seem to have the required skill with the lance. Enough to convince ${item-singular: 0[2]} to lend you its power, at any rate.${prompt}'
  9311: Having this spear on the battlefield makes you a match for almost any opponent.${prompt}
  9312: |-
    Think well on what this means, and on how a weapon like this should be used.
    You have my admiration, adventurer. You have done well...${prompt}
  9313: '...${prompt}'
  9314: The ceremony of inheritance is complete.${prompt}
  9315: It is time for you to go forth and experience my overwhelming strength...${prompt}
  9316: |-
    ...
    I have been rediscovered at last.${prompt}
  9317: Thanks to you, I have made my escape from the shrouded land.${prompt}
  9318: You must now gain the sanction of my master...${prompt}
  9319: It is a pity, indeed.${prompt}
  9320: This day has come far too soon for my liking.${prompt}
  9321: |-
    However, you are a master of the ninja trade.
    I concede that you will make a fitting wielder of the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  9322: |-
    Take this blade as your own.
    Travel far down the path of the ninja.${prompt}
  9323: I will be watching you from the shadows...${prompt}
  9324: '...${prompt}'
  9325: A fine master...${prompt}
  9326: My keen edge is now yours to wield. A sharpness said to make even demons wail...${prompt}
  9327: |-
    ...
    This day has finally come.${prompt}
  9328: |-
    I am to be released to this world for the first time in an age.
    Is this reason to celebrate, or despair...?${prompt}
  9329: In any event...${prompt}
  9330: What is going on here?${prompt}
  9331: Ah, my successor has come.${prompt}
  9332: 'I sought to master the way of the samurai, and traveled to the Far East for training. By the time I had gained the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and returned to my home, the Great War had begun.${prompt}'
  9333: When I think on it, my life has been a long road of trials. But to see the arrival of my successor makes me feel that all has not been in vain.${prompt}
  9334: |-
    You have my gratitude.
    Farewell, ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}
  9335: '...${prompt}'
  9336: It has been a hard path to reach this point.${prompt}
  9337: |-
    But your journey in the way of the samurai has just begun.
    You have yet to attain perfection.
    Let us continue your training...${prompt}
  9338: |-
    ...
    At long last, you have arrived.${prompt}
  9339: I was not convinced you were serious about completing this trial...${prompt}
  9340: You have proven me wrong...${prompt}
  9341: I have heard of your coming.${prompt}
  9342: You are to be the new master of this hammer of war?${prompt}
  9343: |-
    Every time ${item-singular: 0[2]} is reborn it gains a new wielder, who ultimately must pass it on to a successor.
    I have swung this hammer for more than eight hundred years. I never wished to part with it.${prompt}
  9344: "However, there is little meaning in me keeping it now. \nIf you will wield this weapon for a just cause, I hand its power over to you.${prompt}"
  9345: |-
    Now, take the hammer and go!
    Just be careful with how you handle it.
    Do not let its might crush you as well...${prompt}
  9346: '...${prompt}'
  9347: My might is yours to wield.${prompt}
  9348: Go forth and experience the destructive power that laid low the Earth Serpent...${prompt}
  9349: |-
    ...
    So, you have found me.${prompt}
  9350: |-
    I must give you my thanks.
    I have been freed from the hell of Dynamis and can regain my true power once again.${prompt}
  9351: And now...${prompt}
  9352: Hwaah!${prompt}
  9353: Just when I thought I had finally returned to this world, I find you standing here, ready to snatch my precious staff away.${prompt}
  9354: |-
    Well, it's for the best, I suppose.
    In my current state, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is nothing more than an ornament, its power going to waste.${prompt}
  9355: |-
    I entrust this staff to you!
    Take up ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${name-player}, and bind it to you in a contract of blood!${prompt}
  9356: |-
    I take my leave of you now.
    I only wish that I was able to stay a little longer...${prompt}
  9357: '...${prompt}'
  9358: I am yours to wield.${prompt}
  9359: |-
    But you are not yet my master.
    By watching your actions from this time onwards, I will decide if you are worthy of the title...${prompt}
  9360: |-
    ...
    You have discovered my resting place.${prompt}
  9361: |-
    The prison of souls has let loose its shackles, and I am free to loose arrows in this world once more.
    My thanks.${prompt}
  9362: Ah, one more test of your patience...${prompt}
  9363: Where is this place?${prompt}
  9364: |-
    Of course. How could I forget.
    I am Ghebben. I was entrusted with this bow by a warrior of the Far East.${prompt}
  9365: |-
    Your hands tell me that your skill in archery is far from ordinary.
    ${item-singular: 0[2]} will fit snugly into your sure grasp.${prompt}
  9366: |-
    However, this bow belongs to Sir Nasu, the warrior of whom I spoke.
    You must remember that you are merely its keeper for a time.${prompt}
  9367: Farewell...${prompt}
  9368: '...${prompt}'
  9369: |-
    It is an honor to be owned by a just master.
    Sir Ghebben was a truly splendid archer.${prompt}
  9370: |-
    You are now the one to draw me in battle.
    I will be at your side on any road you choose to travel, along with the destructive power of my arrows.${prompt}
  9371: |-
    ...
    We finally meet.${prompt}
  9372: I am now free from the pit of Dynamis to spit fire in this world once again.${prompt}
  9373: But I must ask you to wait before taking me into your possession...${prompt}
  9374: |-
    Why'd you have to go and wake me up? I was having the most relaxing sleep.
    Oh, this place looks familiar...${prompt}
  9375: Hm? You think you're the one who's going to take up my gun?${prompt}
  9376: 'You do seem to have a fair eye for marksmanship. And ${item-singular: 0[2]} would look perfect nestled in the crook of your arm...${prompt}'
  9377: Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.${prompt}
  9378: This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...${prompt}
  9379: '...${prompt}'
  9380: A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.${prompt}
  9381: Take me to a new battlefield, a new arena for the hunt...${prompt}
  9382: |-
    ...
    I am saved.${prompt}
  9383: Silenced for too long in the prison of Dynamis, I can once again let my brazen call echo through this land!${prompt}
  9384: A few more moments, if you please...${prompt}
  9385: |-
    Hello there.
    I am Terounalivet, a military musician of the Hydra Corps.${prompt}
  9386: |-
    You've never heard of me?
    Before joining the army I was quite the famous bard, mobbed by fans in every town I passed through.${prompt}
  9387: 'To be completely truthful, I am heartbroken to be giving up the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the most famous of instruments, even to a fellow bard.${prompt}'
  9388: But an instrument only shows its true worth when being played. This horn should be delighted to be passed on to such a talent as yourself.${prompt}
  9389: She has a capricious soul, but do treat her well. And do not forget that even without a raging battle, you can still play a tune for the simple enjoyment of those around you...${prompt}

  9441: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  9442: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  9443: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  9444: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  9445: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  9446: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  9447: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  9448: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  9449: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  9450: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  9451: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  9452: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  9453: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  9454: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  9455: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  9456: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  9457: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  9458: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  9459: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  9460: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  9461: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  9462: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  9463: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  9464: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  9465: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  9466: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  9467: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  9468: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}

  9477: |-
    Quoi !?
    Des aéronefs blindés ?
    Des scientifiques encapuchonnés ?${prompt}
  9478: |-
    Eh bien…
    Les scientifiques, ce sont probablement ceux de Jeuno.
    Quant aux aéronefs, la seule chose qui me vient à l’esprit, ce sont ceux modifiés pour le combat pendant la Grande Guerre. Mais ce projet a été abandonné après que les forces alliées ont vaincu les armées du Seigneur de l’Ombre.${prompt}
  9479: Je le sais parce que j’ai fait partie de ce projet !${prompt}
  9480: Il y a vingt ans, j’ai reçu une invitation du duc en personne pour travailler sur un projet secret pour le Duché. À part moi et quelques autres scientifiques de Windurst, tous ceux assignés au projet étaient ces hommes sinistres, au visage blême, vêtus de robes sombres à capuche.${prompt}
  9481: Ils montraient rarement leur visage en public, mais d’après ce que j’ai vu, leurs connaissances et leur technologie surpassaient de loin tout ce que j’avais jamais vu sur Vana’diel.${prompt}
  9482: Eh bien, l’« unité de propulsion cristalline » qu’ils avaient mise au point était en avance de plusieurs années sur son époque.${prompt}
  9483: Mais elle nécessitait une source d’énergie bien plus puissante que ce que les huit cristaux élémentaires de Vana’diel pouvaient fournir.${prompt}
  9484: Qu’est-ce que les scientifiques de Jeuno utilisaient pour alimenter leur unité, et où avaient-ils trouvé cette puissance ?${prompt}
  9485: J’étais déterminé à le découvrir, alors j’ai commencé à les observer dès que j’en avais l’occasion.${prompt}
  9486: 'Il ne m’a pas fallu longtemps pour remarquer qu’ils menaient de nombreuses expériences étranges autour de la Tour de ${choice: 0}[Holla/Dem/Mea], mais je n’arrivais pas vraiment à comprendre ce qu’ils fabriquaient…${prompt}'

    Alors, Prishe. D’abord, permets-moi de m’excuser de t’avoir gardée enfermée si longtemps. Pas de rancune, d’accord ?
    Mais j’ai besoin que tu me dises : qui est ce Bahamut dont tu parles sans arrêt ?${prompt}
  9492: Oh, tu veux dire le Roi Wyrm. Eh bien, tout allait bien jusqu’au jour où, tout à coup, ce dragon gigantesque est apparu au-dessus de ma ville natale.${prompt}
  9493: On s’apprêtait à rencontrer ce dragon pour tenter de le raisonner quand, sorti de nulle part, un énorme aéronef bardé de canons et de mitrailleuses a surgi dans le ciel.${prompt}
  9494: On était en train de flanquer une bonne raclée aux gars de cet engin quand, pouf, je me suis retrouvée téléportée dans ce fichu trou infernal.${prompt}
  9495: |-
    Quoi !?
    Tu te battais vraiment contre le Duché ?${prompt}
  9496: Hé, on n’allait pas rester là à les regarder tuer Bahamut ! De toute façon, c’est Jeuno qui a tiré le premier.${prompt}
  9497: Si j’avais eu un peu plus de temps, j’aurais pu comprendre ce que le Roi Wyrm voulait dire en parlant du Gardien de l’Apocalypse…${prompt}
  9498: "Gardien de l’Apocalypse…\nJ’ai déjà entendu ce nom quelque part…${prompt} "
  9499: |-
    Hmmm…
    Je ne sais pas exactement ce que c’est, mais j’ai le pressentiment que quelque chose d’énorme se trame.${prompt}
  9500: Au moment où le télépoint de Dem s’est brisé, j’ai reçu un rapport sur l’apparition d’un dragon géant au-dessus de la mer, au nord de Jeuno.${prompt}
  9501: Si ce dragon était vraiment Bahamut, alors on peut supposer que ces deux événements sont liés d’une manière ou d’une autre.${prompt}
  9502: |-
    Voilà une raison de plus pour retourner à Riverne et tenter de rencontrer le Roi Wyrm une nouvelle fois !
    Allez, en route pour Jeuno !${prompt}
  9503: Jeuno ? Après tout ce qui s’est passé, pourquoi voudrais-tu y aller ?${prompt}
  9504: J’ai un vieil ami qui travaille au Tenshodo. Si je lui demande, il sera ravi de préparer un bateau pour retourner à Tavnazia.${prompt}
  9505: Eh bien, à bientôt ! Merci pour l’hospitalité !
  9506: |-
    Hé, attends !
    Comment comptes-tu aller jusqu’à Jeuno ? Sais-tu au moins à quelle distance c’est !?${prompt}

    Bahamut…
    Tavnazia…${prompt}
  9508: Mes oreilles ont du mal à croire ce que je viens d’entendre. Tout ça pourrait-il être vrai ?${prompt}
  9509: Je suppose que le seul moyen de le savoir serait de suivre cette Prishe encore un peu. Elle a dit qu’elle allait à Jeuno pour voir un ami… Qui pensez-vous qu’elle connaisse dans le Duché ?${prompt}
  9510: L’Expédition Multinationale ? Oui, je me souviens d’en avoir lu quelque chose à l’école primaire, mais si tu veux des détails, il faudra demander à quelqu’un d’un peu plus vieux.${prompt}
  9511: |-
    Le chef Cid est plutôt vieux…
    Oh-oh… Ne lui dis pas que j’ai dit ça, d’accord ?${prompt}
  9512: Tu verras qu’il n’y a pas beaucoup de gens prêts à parler de l’Expédition Multinationale.${prompt}
  9513: Surtout parmi nous, les Galka…${prompt}
  9514: Quoi, tu veux entendre parler de l’Expédition Multinationale ?${prompt}
  9515: Qu’y a-t-il à savoir ? Tous ceux qui sont partis dans cette fichue mission sont morts ou ont été…${prompt}
  9516: D’habitude, je ne crois pas aux histoires de magie ou de malédictions, mais après avoir entendu les récits de ce qui s’est passé là-haut, dans les Terres du Nord, je ne vois pas d’autre explication.${prompt}
  9517: Tu as déjà entendu des deux autres nations que l’expédition a été proposée par la République, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9518: |-
    <Soupir>
    Peut-être est-il temps que j’affronte mes crimes passés…
    C’est moi qui ai convaincu le gouvernement d’envoyer une équipe dans les Terres du Nord.${prompt}
  9519: Il y a trente ans, un homme a apporté une pierre étrange à la Métallurgie.${prompt}
  9520: Elle n’était pas plus grosse que mon poing, mais rien qu’en s’en approchant, on pouvait sentir le pouvoir jaillir de ses facettes.${prompt}
  9521: Ce pouvoir dépassait tout ce que j’avais vu dans n’importe quel cristal. J’étais à la fois stupéfait et émerveillé par ce que j’avais sous les yeux.${prompt}
  9522: Quand l’homme m’a dit que c’était un fragment d’un cristal trouvé dans les Terres du Nord, j’étais persuadé qu’il y avait encore plus à découvrir là-haut.${prompt}
  9523: Je me disais que si je pouvais mettre la main sur cette source d’énergie et la ramener à Bastok, la République prospérerait et deviendrait finalement la nation la plus puissante et avancée du monde.${prompt}
  9524: Alors, j’en ai parlé au président de l’époque et lui ai suggéré d’organiser une expédition menée par un groupe de Mousquetaires.${prompt}
  9525: Ça devait rester top secret, mais d’une manière ou d’une autre, l’information a filtré jusqu’aux deux autres nations, et…${prompt}
  9526: Et au final, l’expédition n’a rien trouvé, et nous avons perdu bien plus que nous ne pouvions l’imaginer…${prompt}
  9527: Maintenant que j’y pense, l’énergie de cette pierre aurait peut-être suffi à alimenter l’unité de propulsion cristalline.${prompt}
  9528: Jeuno aurait-il déjà découvert une nouvelle source d’énergie dans les Terres du Nord ?${prompt}
  9529: |-
    Si seulement j’avais encore cette pierre…
    Malheureusement, elle a disparu il y a trente ans… juste au moment de l’expédition.${prompt}
  9530: L’homme qui m’a vendu la pierre – qu’il appelait « magisite » – disait l’avoir rapportée de Tavnazia, et que c’était un morceau d’une gemme plus grande connue sous le nom d’« Étoile de Tavnazia ».${prompt}
  9531: Peut-être que cette fille un peu folle aux cheveux bleus de l’île sait quelque chose sur cette gemme.${prompt}
  9532: Penses-tu pouvoir lui poser la question pour moi ?${prompt}
  9533: Alors, toi aussi, tu as un morceau de magisite…${prompt}
  9534: Ça ressemble à celle que j’ai vue autrefois, mais je ne ressens pas le même genre de pouvoir en émaner.${prompt}
  9535: Non, celle que j’ai vue était noire comme la nuit et si puissante qu’on pouvait sentir son énergie à plus de vingt yalms de distance.${prompt}
  9536: L’Expédition Multinationale, organisée il y a trente ans, a débuté quand un éclat de la légendaire « Étoile de Tavnazia » a été apporté à la République.${prompt}
  9537: On murmurait que la gemme avait été découverte à l’origine dans les Terres du Nord, c’est pourquoi l’équipe s’y est rendue en premier.${prompt}

  9575: Bien sûr. Les théologiens de Tavnazia utilisaient cette boîte pour la cérémonie de baptême.${prompt}
  9576: Elle devrait encore être dans le tabernacle du Sacrarium. Je le saurais, parce que je suis la seule à avoir la clé de cet endroit. J’ai protégé cette clé depuis avant la Grande Guerre – sur ordre de Mademoiselle Mildaurion !${prompt}
  9577: |-
    La cérémonie de baptême… ?
    Alors l’accident de Prishe était… ?${prompt}
  9578: |-
    Oui, pourquoi ne l’ai-je pas vu plus tôt ?
    Même si on t’a qualifiée d’abhorrente, tu as quand même pris part au baptême des théologiens !${prompt}
  9579: |-
    Alors, laissez-moi vous dire ceci.
    Pendant que j’étais à Tavnazia, j’ai essayé d’enquêter sur le « vaisseau baptismal » pour Maître Cid.${prompt}
  9580: Mais j’ai dû abandonner mon enquête avant même de commencer. Quelques jours avant mon arrivée, un officier du Duché, Nag’molada, s’est introduit dans le Sacrarium et a volé la relique.${prompt}
  9581: Le vaisseau a été volé !?${prompt}
  9582: |-
    Ce sont ces maudits encapuchonnés de Jeuno !
    Ils ont dû apprendre que je cherchais les origines de la magisite noire et ont volé la boîte pour m’empêcher de mettre la main dessus !${prompt}
  9583: J’étais si près du but ! Maintenant, je ne percerai jamais ses secrets !${prompt}
  9584: |-
    Attends une seconde…
    Prishe, tu as dit que tu connaissais la boîte. Que peux-tu nous en dire ? Même le moindre détail pourrait nous aider.${prompt}
  9585: Le vaisseau est maléfique. Il a bouleversé ma vie. M’a entraînée en enfer et ramenée…${prompt}
  9586: Prishe ?${prompt}
  9587: Nous devons reprendre le vaisseau des mains de Nag’molada ! Il appartient à Tavnazia !${prompt}
  9588: Prishe ! Attends !${prompt}
  9589: Prishe ! Tu ne peux pas continuer à partir seule comme ça ! C’est trop dangereux !${prompt}
  9590: ${name-player}, tu as mentionné que toi et Tenzen aviez prévu de rencontrer Nag’molada dans la tour nord-ouest de Pso’Xja.${prompt}
  9591: |-
    Une grande énergie dans les Terres du Nord…
    Bien que ça ne soit pas forcément lié à ma mission actuelle, ça m’intrigue… à titre personnel…${prompt}
  9592: Je t’attendrai à Beaucedine, ${name-player} !${prompt}
  9593: Eh bien, ça ne sent pas bon, hein ? ${name-player}, tu devrais probablement rattraper tes compagnons au plus vite.${prompt}
  9594: Moi ? Je vais continuer à chercher plus d’infos sur la magisite. J’ai encore quelques cartes dans ma manche.${prompt}
  9595: |-
    Ce « vaisseau baptismal »…
    Si je pouvais mettre la main dessus, imaginez les progrès que la République pourrait accomplir…${prompt}
  9596: |-
    ${name-player} !
    Dépêche-toi d’aller à la tour nord-ouest de Pso’Xja.
    Je reste ici pour chercher plus d’infos sur la magisite. J’ai encore quelques cartes dans ma manche.${prompt}
  9597: ${name-player} ! Je commençais à m’inquiéter pour toi ! Vas-tu bien ?${prompt}
  9598: J’ai entendu de Louverance que vous n’avez pas pu récupérer la boîte, mais au moins tu es en un seul morceau. Quelqu’un là-haut veille sur toi, c’est certain.${prompt}
  9599: Maître Cid… Ah, et ${choice-player-gender}[Monsieur/Madame] ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9600: Je dois féliciter les aventuriers pour leurs moyens de transport ingénieux.${prompt}
  9601: Après notre épreuve, Tenzen et Ulmia sont rentrés sains et saufs à San d’Oria.${prompt}
  9602: Mais il n’y a toujours aucun signe de Prishe…${prompt}
  9603: On ne peut qu’espérer qu’elle ait été aussi débrouillarde que ${name-player} pour s’échapper du glacier.${prompt}
  9604: |-
    Eh bien, j’ai de mauvaises nouvelles pour vous…
    Un message a été envoyé aux trois nations depuis Jeuno… Prishe est recherchée pour des accusations criminelles. Le Duché a émis un mandat pour son arrestation immédiate.${prompt}
  9605: C’est ridicule !${prompt}
  9606: Quand Prishe a chanté sa chanson, Selh’teus a pu s’échapper… Nag’molada pense que Prishe et le garçon sont de mèche !${prompt}
  9607: |-
    La chanson de Prishe…
    Le quatrième vers de la « Memoria de la S^tona »… Mais où l’a-t-elle apprise ?${prompt}
  9608: |-
    Je n’en sais rien…
    Mais une chose est sûre : il faut trouver Prishe avant que Jeuno ne mette la main sur elle !${prompt}
  9609: On pourra alors lui demander des explications sur la chanson et le Gardien de l’Apocalypse…${prompt}
  9610: |-
    Oui, et sur Bahamut.
    Qu’essayait-elle de nous dire… ?${prompt}
  9611: |-
    Comment rompre le pacte avec le Roi Wyrm… ?
    Comment s’opposer à ses actions… ?${prompt}
  9612: |-
    Le pacte…
    Quand le Gardien de l’Apocalypse arrivera, Bahamut détruira l’humanité…${prompt}
  9613: |-
    Détruire l’humanité !?
    Vous voulez dire que le conquérant des cieux, Bahamut, prépare un génocide de masse ?${prompt}
  9614: Malheureusement, oui. Et pour autant qu’on sache, le Gardien de l’Apocalypse est déjà là… sous la forme du garçon, Selh’teus.${prompt}
  9615: Envoyé par les anciens depuis la capitale céleste d’Al’Taieu, l’arrivée de Selh’teus est prédite dans le pacte de l’humanité avec Bahamut – et c’est pourquoi Bahamut s’est réveillé lui aussi.${prompt}
  9616: Et maintenant, le Roi Wyrm a commencé à rassembler ses sbires endormis – il forme une armée pour accomplir le pacte.${prompt}
  9617: Nous sommes allés dans l’antre de l’avatar terrestre. Mais il n’a pas écouté nos supplications.${prompt}
  9618: Son cœur est corrompu par la colère, et il n’y a aucun moyen de le purifier.${prompt}
  9619: C’est pourquoi notre seule option est de rompre le pacte, d’une manière ou d’une autre… Mais comment… ?${prompt}
  9620: Rompre le pacte… Hmmm…${prompt}
  9621: |-
    Ça ne peut pas être si difficile...
    Réfléchissons-y...
    Le Gardien arrive... Bahamut anéantit l'humanité...${prompt}
  9622: |-
    Le Gardien arrive...
    Bahamut anéantit l'humanité...${prompt}
  9623: |-
    Le Gardien arrive...
    Bahamut...${prompt}
  9624: |-
    Attendez une minute ! Voilà !
    Que se passerait-il si le Gardien de l'Apocalypse n'arrivait jamais ?${prompt}
  9625: |-
    ...!
    Alors Bahamut n'aurait pas à...${prompt}
  9626: Je ne sais pas si c'est ce que Prishe essayait de dire, mais si nous pouvons faire quelque chose à propos du gardien, Bahamut n'aura aucun pacte à accomplir ! Vana'diel sera sauvé !${prompt}
  9627: Le problème est de trouver ce gardien...${prompt}
  9628: |-
    Mais nous savons déjà qui il est ! Le Gardien de l'Apocalypse est Selh'teus !
    Capturer le garçon a été notre mission dès le départ !${prompt}
  9629: Cela peut être une tâche presque impossible, mais si nous avions l'assistance de Carbuncle, le porteur des arcs-en-ciel...${prompt}
  9630: |-
    Tenzen !
    Si cela vous convient, j'aimerais essayer de localiser Prishe.${prompt}
  9631: Prishe a la capacité de communiquer avec Selh'teus. Peut-être sait-elle quelque chose que nous n'avons pas encore réalisé !${prompt}
  9632: Je vais enquêter davantage sur la capitale céleste d'Al'Taieu. Si c'est d'ici que vient le garçon, alors il doit y avoir un chemin pour y retourner.${prompt}
  9633: Se séparer en trois groupes pour trouver des informations sur Prishe et le gardien... Pourquoi n'y ai-je pas pensé plus tôt !?${prompt}
  9634: Donc, qu'allez-vous faire, ${name-player} ?${prompt}
  9635: |-
    Je vais...
    ${selection-lines}
    Enquêter sur Al'Taieu.
    Trouver Selh'teus.
    Trouver Prishe.${prompt}
  9636: Louverance...${prompt}
  9637: Je prévois de me rendre à Tavnazia pour enquêter davantage sur la capitale céleste d'Al'Taieu.${prompt}
  9638: C'est la Cathédrale de Tavnazia qui a ramené ce nom de l'obscurité, et il est plus que probable que c'est l'endroit que cherche le Cardinal Mildaurion.${prompt}
  9639: Tenzen...${prompt}
  9640: ${name-player}, je me rends sur le Plateau de La Théine en quête de la sagesse de Carbuncle.${prompt}
  9641: Avec le pouvoir et la guidance du porteur des arcs-en-ciel, je crois que nous avons une chance de vaincre le garçon, Selh'teus.${prompt}
  9642: Ulmia...${prompt}
  9643: ${name-player}, je prévois de commencer mes recherches à San d'Oria.${prompt}
  9644: Si Prishe a vraiment échappé aux glaciers à pied, ce serait la ville la plus proche. Peut-être que quelqu'un l'a vue passer.${prompt}
  9645: |-
    Vrai...
    Si vous découvrez quoi que ce soit d'utile, revenez ici, et nous verrons ce que nous pouvons en faire. Cela vaut pour chacun d'entre vous.${prompt}
  9646: Nous sommes tous dans le même bateau maintenant. Nous pourrions rencontrer des eaux agitées devant nous, mais avec le bon vieux Cid à la barre, vous n'avez rien à craindre !${prompt}
  9647: |-
    Compris, Maître Cid !
    Maintenant, partons ! Nous n'avons pas de temps à perdre !${prompt}
  9648: Elle a dit qu'elle se dirigeait vers San d'Oria.${prompt}
  9649: Il a dit quelque chose à propos de demander l'assistance de Carbuncle.${prompt}
  9650: Il a dit qu'il retournait à Tavnazia.${prompt}
  9651: Quoi ? Vous dites que vous cherchez Louverance ?${prompt}
  9652: Je suis désolé. Je ne l'ai pas vu depuis qu'il est parti.${prompt}
  9653: |-
    Oncle Cid !
    Une bande de Gobelins furieux a attaqué le restaurant Le Mouton Fumant ! Maître Oggbi les a repoussés, mais pas avant qu'ils ne blessent certains des invités !${prompt}
  9654: |-
    Des Gobelins à Bastok !?
    ...Hilda va bien !?${prompt}
  9655: ${name-player} !${prompt}
  9656: |-
    Venez avec nous tout de suite !
    Jabbos a été ramené à Movalpolos !${prompt}
  9657: |-
    ...!
    Jabbos...!?${prompt}
  9658: Jabbos ? Qui est-ce ?${prompt}
  9659: Un Galka qui vit avec les Moblins à Movalpolos.${prompt}
  9660: Depuis un siècle, il veille sur ces créatures… essayant de les convaincre de vivre en paix avec ceux du monde au-dessus de leurs sombres cavernes.${prompt}
  9661: Oublie cet homme. Il a oublié ses racines – il a renié son identité. Il n’est plus un Galka.${prompt}
  9662: Les Moblins l’ont attaqué ? Hmph. C’est probablement sa faute.${prompt}
  9663: Peut-être, mais nous ne pouvons pas détourner le regard. Sans l’aide de Jabbos, nous ne capturerons peut-être jamais Selh’teus !${prompt}
  9664: Viens, ${name-player}. Nous devons retourner rapidement à la ville souterraine !${prompt}
  9665: Cent ans à vivre avec les hommes-bêtes… Ce Galka doit être soit extrêmement courageux, soit extrêmement fou pour tenter une telle prouesse.${prompt}
  9666: Mais attends une minute… Tout ce temps passé avec les Moblins signifierait qu’il connaît tous leurs secrets… Et c’est probablement pourquoi les petits gars sont venus à Bastok pour le ramener dans leur ville !${prompt}
  9667: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Tu dois retourner à Movalpolos au plus vite et aider Louverance à trouver Jabbos !${prompt}
  9668: Alors, si je comprends bien, le Gardien de l’Apocalypse est en réalité la réincarnation du Dieu du Crépuscule !?${prompt}
  9669: Et nous allons devoir le combattre !? Ça ne se déroule pas comme je l’espérais…${prompt}
  9670: Quelqu’un sait-il où le garçon, Selh’teus, a pu aller ?${prompt}
  9671: Ne pouvons-nous pas demander aux Moblins ? Peut-être qu’ils savent quelque chose.${prompt}
  9672: |-
    Selh’teus… est parti…
    Il a quitté… Movalpolos…
    Les Moblins… ne savent… rien…${prompt}
  9673: Le garçon… est parti…${prompt}
  9674: |-
    Mais mes amis…
    Ils croient… qu’il reviendra… alors ils continuent… de creuser…${prompt}
  9675: Ils vont… lui montrer… le chemin vers… le cristal…${prompt}
  9676: …${prompt}
  9677: Je vois… Mais vu leurs actions précédentes, je pense qu’il serait sage de les surveiller. Qui sait ce qu’ils pourraient tenter ensuite.${prompt}
  9678: S’ils trouvaient un moyen d’atteindre le cinquième cristal-mère avant nous, les conséquences pourraient être incommensurables.${prompt}
  9679: Je vois… Mais vu leurs actions précédentes, je pense qu’il serait sage de les surveiller. Qui sait ce qu’ils pourraient tenter ensuite.${prompt}
  9680: Nous ne pouvons pas les laisser guider le Gardien directement vers le cinquième cristal-mère.${prompt}
  9681: |-
    Les Moblins…
    Mes amis… ne feraient pas…${prompt}
  9682: Maître Cid. Nous n’avons ni le temps ni les ressources pour affronter les Moblins. Actuellement, nous devons faire face au problème qui se présente – Bahamut et son plan pour détruire l’humanité.${prompt}
  9683: Si les Moblins creusent ce tunnel pour le garçon, alors il y a de fortes chances qu’il revienne quand ils auront fini. Et quand il reviendra, ce sera notre opportunité parfaite pour le capturer !${prompt}
  9684: C’est vrai… mais pense aux implications. Un chemin vers le cinquième cristal sera ouvert…${prompt}
  9685: |-
    D’accord.
    D’abord, nous attendons que tout le monde revienne. Il y a encore pas mal de choses que Prishe doit clarifier. Moi-même, je vais avoir besoin d’un peu plus de temps pour terminer mon travail.${prompt}
  9686: Ton travail ? Qu’est-ce que tu mijotes, vieux bonhomme ?${prompt}
  9687: |-
    Hé hé hé. Veux-tu savoir ?
    Je fabrique mes ailes.${prompt}
  9688: Selon des informations internes sur lesquelles je suis tombé par hasard, Bahamut se cache au-delà de la mer de nuages… plus haut que quiconque n’a jamais volé.${prompt}

  9691: Excellent ! Quand penses-tu qu’elle sera prête ?${prompt}
  9692: Du calme, Louverance. Je travaille aussi vite que possible. J’ai certains des meilleurs artisans de Vana’diel sur ce projet.${prompt}
  9693: Et tant que nous n’avons pas fini, nous avons besoin de toi à Movalpolos pour surveiller ces Moblins. Penses-tu pouvoir gérer ça ?${prompt}
  9694: Et tant que nous n’avons pas fini, nous avons besoin de toi à Movalpolos pour surveiller ces Moblins. Penses-tu pouvoir gérer ça ?${prompt}
  9695: N’aie crainte, Maître Cid. Jabbos m’a fourni beaucoup d’informations sur ses compagnons souterrains.${prompt}
  9696: Et quelques-uns de mes… “amis” prêteront également main-forte.${prompt}
  9697: |-
    Je sais… tout sur… Movalpolos…
    Je sais tout… sur les Moblins…${prompt}
  9698: D’accord alors. On dirait que j’ai trouvé les bons hommes pour cette tâche.${prompt}
  9699: Au fait, as-tu entendu quelque chose concernant Dame Prishe ?${prompt}
  9700: En cherchant des informations sur Al’Taieu, j’ai appris l’existence d’un groupe de Mithra connu sous le nom de chasseuses de péchés.${prompt}
  9701: Je ne suis pas sûr des détails, mais je crois qu’elles sont venues de leur patrie mithra pour capturer la Cardinale Mildaurion et la punir pour ses crimes passés.${prompt}
  9702: Cependant, maintenant que les trois croient que la Cardinale est morte, elles recherchent Prishe pour qu’elle expie les péchés de Mildaurion.${prompt}
  9703: C’est ridicule ! Comment pensent-elles pouvoir s’en tirer avec quelque chose d’aussi insensé !?${prompt}
  9704: Nous ne pouvons qu’espérer qu’Ulmia trouve Prishe à San d’Oria avant les Traqueuses Mithra…${prompt}
  9705: Et puis il y a Tenzen. Aucun mot de lui non plus…${prompt}
  9706: Il a dit qu’il se rendait au Plateau de La Theine pour demander l’aide de l’avatar terrestre Carbuncle, mais…${prompt}
  9707: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Pourrais-tu essayer de découvrir ce qui est arrivé à Ulmia et Tenzen ?${prompt}
  9708: Ils pourraient être en sérieux danger. Nous comptons sur toi !${prompt}
  9709: |-
    Chasseuses de péchés…
    Peut-être qu’elles aussi pensent que Prishe est la cause de tout ça…${prompt}
  9710: Maître Cid, qu’insinues-tu ?${prompt}
  9711: |-
    Hm…
    Je vais rappeler Tenzen de Jeuno et lui demander de se rendre à Movalpolos.${prompt}
  9712: Les choses qu’il nous a dites étaient incroyables. Tu dois les entendre toi-même.${prompt}
  9713: ${name-player}, nous devons trouver Prishe aussi vite que possible. C’est pourquoi je veux que tu te rendes à San d’Oria et aides Ulmia dans sa recherche.${prompt}
  9714: Bonne chance, et qu’Altana soit avec toi.${prompt}
  9715: |-
    Hmmm…
    Ulmia est passée il y a quelques jours avec quelques-unes de ces traqueuses. Elles ont dit qu’elles avaient trouvé Prishe, mais qu’elle s’était échappée avant qu’elles ne puissent… terminer leur affaire.${prompt}
  9716: Elles ont aussi dit que lorsqu’elle s’est enfuie, elle a emporté un gros morceau de magicite connu sous le nom d’Étoile de Tavnazia. Tu ne saurais pas quelque chose à ce sujet, par hasard ?${prompt}
  9717: |-
    L’Étoile de Tavnazia…
    On disait qu’elle avait été perdue il y a vingt ans pendant la Grande Guerre…
    Tu dis que Dame Prishe la possède !?${prompt}
  9718: Mais où a-t-elle pu s’enfuir… ?${prompt}
  9719: Et voilà exactement pourquoi nous sommes coincés comme un chocobo dans la boue. Ulmia n’a pas dormi depuis des jours, la pauvre petite.${prompt}
  9720: Eh bien, tout ce que nous pouvons faire maintenant est d’attendre le retour de Tenzen et prier pour qu’il ait trouvé quelque chose.${prompt}
  9721: ${name-player}, Tenzen a dit qu’il se dirigeait vers le Plateau de La Theine pour trouver Carbuncle. Pourquoi n’essaierais-tu pas de le rejoindre ?${prompt}
  9722: |-
    Maître Cid !
    Dame Ulmia est-elle revenue !?
    Et qu’en est-il de Dame Prishe !?${prompt}
  9723: Whoa, calme-toi maintenant. Pourquoi ne nous racontes-tu pas ce qui s’est passé…${prompt}
  9724: |-
    Calme-toi. Calme-toi. Ulmia est arrivée ici il y a quelques jours. Elle se repose dans l’une de nos résidences pour invités. Prishe… Eh bien, il n’y a toujours aucun signe d’elle…
    Mais avant que nous partions à sa recherche, pourquoi ne nous dis-tu pas ce que tu as découvert durant ton voyage.${prompt}
  9725: Les avatars terrestres t’ont dit ça ? C’est tellement difficile à croire, mais…${prompt}
  9726: Certaines des choses que Nag’molada a dites ont un certain sens.${prompt}
  9727: Par exemple, les récentes lectures étranges d’énergie provenant des crags. Je les ai étudiées aussi.${prompt}
  9728: Mais je n’avais jamais imaginé que les vestiges des anciens tentaient quelque chose d’aussi insensé – utiliser les lignes pour converger l’énergie des cinq cristaux…${prompt}
  9729: …et finalement utiliser cette puissance concentrée pour ouvrir les Portes du Paradis…${prompt}
  9730: |-
    Hmmm…
    Je ne suis pas sûr, mais avec autant d’énergie, ouvrir les portes pourrait ne pas être aussi impossible qu’il y paraît.${prompt}
  9731: Et avec toute la technologie que ces scientifiques encapuchonnés de Jeuno possèdent…${prompt}
  9732: Mais attends une minute. N’ont-ils pas déjà essayé d’ouvrir les portes il y a dix mille ans… et échoué lamentablement ? Regarde leur capitale ! Elle a sombré au fond de la mer.${prompt}
  9733: Tant que nous n’aurons pas découvert ce qu’est vraiment cet endroit appelé Paradis, nous ne pouvons pas laisser les Zilart faire ce qu’ils veulent.${prompt}
  9734: C’est vrai, mais nous devons d’abord affronter le problème qui se présente à nous – le Gardien de l’Apocalypse !${prompt}
  9735: J’étais certain que Selh’teus était celui que nous cherchions, mais après avoir entendu le témoignage de Fenrir…${prompt}
  9736: Que le Gardien de l’Apocalypse naîtrait à Tavnazia…${prompt}
  9737: |-
    Tenzen.
    D’après ce que tu m’as dit, le traitement de Prishe à Tavnazia était assez hors du commun.${prompt}
  9738: Es-tu en train de dire que c’est parce que… elle est le Gardien ?${prompt}
  9739: |-
    Bien que ça me fasse mal de le croire, tous les événements récents semblent pointer vers cette conclusion.
    J’ai demandé à Phoenix une réponse à maintes reprises, mais elle ne fait que répondre qu’elle non plus ne sait pas…${prompt}
  9740: Mais si c’est vrai – si Prishe est le Gardien de l’Apocalypse… alors il n’y a qu’une seule chose que je puisse faire…${prompt}
  9741: Attends, Tenzen ! Nous ne savons pas encore avec certitude si c’est elle !${prompt}
  9742: Ouais, elle est un peu grossière, un peu rude, et sacrément plus sauvage que ce que j’aime chez la plupart de mes compagnons. Mais une fois qu’on dépasse ça, on réalise qu’elle est l’une des personnes les plus honnêtes qu’on puisse rencontrer. Je ne pourrais pas l’imaginer mentir à qui que ce soit, encore moins être infidèle à elle-même.${prompt}
  9743: Tenzen, tu ne peux pas vraiment croire qu’elle a hérité de la volonté de Promathia, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9744: Cependant, je ne peux pas douter de ce que j’ai vu. Je crois que Fenrir m’a montré ce qu’il a fait pour une raison.${prompt}
  9745: Le seul souhait des avatars terrestres est de garder les Portes du Paradis fermées. Quiconque tente de les ouvrir deviendra sans aucun doute leur ennemi.${prompt}
  9746: Peut-être que la volonté de Promathia reste dormante en Dame Prishe. Peut-être qu’elle n’a simplement pas réalisé qu’elle porte la graine du crépuscule.${prompt}
  9747: …${prompt}
  9748: Eh bien, il y a un moyen de le découvrir – et c’est de retrouver Prishe.${prompt}
  9749: Nous pourrons décider quoi faire alors… même si cela implique…${prompt}
  9750: ${name-player}, je veux que tu te rendes à San d’Oria et que tu vérifies comment va Ulmia.${prompt}
  9751: Ça m’inquiète aussi que nous n’ayons rien entendu de Louverance…${prompt}
  9752: Il a dit qu’il allait essayer de rassembler des informations sur la capitale céleste d’Al’Taieu, mais…${prompt}
  9753: Je vais me rendre à Jeuno et enquêter sur la situation là-bas. Si le Duché trouvait Prishe avant nous…${prompt}
  9754: Adieu, Maître Cid.${prompt}
  9755: |-
    Ahem !
    Nous avons quand même de bonnes nouvelles pour toi, Tenzen.
    Il semble que Louverance ait réussi à trouver Selh’teus.${prompt}
  9756: En plus de ça, nous avons peut-être aussi trouvé un moyen d’atteindre le cinquième cristal-mère sous la Mer du Nord.${prompt}
  9757: Vous avez quoi !?${prompt}
  9758: Si tu veux les détails, tu devrais aller parler directement à Louverance.${prompt}
  9759: Raibaht, pourrais-tu indiquer à Tenzen où il peut trouver ses compagnons ?${prompt}
  9760: |-
    D’accord.
    Mais je vais devoir te demander de t’abstenir d’interroger Ulmia tant que Louverance n’est pas revenu. Nous ne voulons pas tirer de conclusions hâtives avant d’avoir une vue d’ensemble.${prompt}
  9761: Tenzen. Je comprends que tu te blâmes de ne pas avoir retrouvé Prishe, mais pense à la pauvre Ulmia et à sa réaction.${prompt}
  9762: Très bien, Maître Cid. Je promets de ne pas parler de ce que j’ai vu à Dame Ulmia avant le retour de Sir Louverance.${prompt}
  9763: Si ce n’est pas trop demander, pourrais-je savoir où elle séjourne ?${prompt}
  9764: Raibaht, montre à Tenzen la chambre d’Ulmia.${prompt}
  9765: |-
    ${name-player}…
    Pour être honnête, je pense que nous sommes peut-être dépassés par tout ça…${prompt}
  9766: |-
    Jusqu’à maintenant, que ce soit pour la science ou la justice, je n’ai jamais trop réfléchi à ce dans quoi je m’embarquais – j’ai juste pris la balle et couru avec aussi vite que possible. Mais cette fois… Cette fois, une petite voix au fond de ma tête me dit que je devrais être prudent.
    Je ne sais pas. Peut-être que je vieillis simplement.${prompt}
  9767: Ce sont ces “anciens” dont tu parles tout le temps. S’ils sont solidement enracinés à Jeuno, il se pourrait qu’il n’y ait rien que nous puissions faire pour les déloger.${prompt}
  9768: Combattre des wyrms et des hommes-bêtes est déjà assez difficile. Je frissonne à l’idée de ce qui arriverait si l’armée du Duché s’en mêlait…${prompt}
  9769: Et il y a autre chose qui me préoccupe.${prompt}
  9770: Ce pays “d’Extrême-Orient” d’où Tenzen est censé venir… Même les pirates de Norg en savent peu à son sujet. Comment savoir si nous pouvons vraiment lui faire confiance… ?${prompt}
  9771: |-
    Qui dit la vérité et qui débite des mensonges ? Cela devient de plus en plus difficile à distinguer.
    Je vois une tempête se profiler à l’horizon. Si nous ne faisons pas attention, notre navire pourrait couler, et tout ce pour quoi nous avons lutté jusqu’à maintenant pourrait être perdu.${prompt}
  9772: Si tu veux vraiment sauver ta nation et son peuple, tu dois être fort. Vois les choses de tes propres yeux ; prends des décisions avec ton propre cœur. Ne te laisse pas duper par ceux qui ont des intentions cachées.${prompt}
  9773: Oh, désolé pour ça, ${name-player}. Je ne voulais pas avoir l’air d’un père qui gronde son ${choice-player-gender}[fils/fille].${prompt}
  9774: |-
    Hm ?
    Qu’est-ce qui ne va pas ?${prompt}
  9775: Louverance a mentionné qu’il allait commencer ses recherches sur Al’Taieu à Tavnazia.${prompt}
  9776: Si tu te dépêches, tu pourrais peut-être le rattraper.${prompt}
  9777: Et je sais que je viens de te dire de prendre des décisions avec ton propre cœur, mais je pense qu’une autre bonne chose à faire maintenant serait de retrouver Prishe…${prompt}
  9778: Ulmia a dit qu’elle allait à San d’Oria pour la chercher. Pourquoi n’irais-tu pas voir si elle a trouvé quelque chose ?${prompt}
  9779: Si Prishe est l’abominable dont parle Tenzen, alors notre seule clé pour la sauver sera Ulmia.${prompt}
  9780: Dépêche-toi, ${name-player}. Je ne pense pas qu’il nous reste beaucoup de temps. Nous devons atteindre Prishe avant que…${prompt}
  9781: |-
    Ulmia !?
    Qui est avec toi ? Ce ne sont pas…${prompt}
  9782: Oui, ce sont les chasseuses de péchés Mithra – les traqueuses venues dans notre pays pour trouver Prishe.${prompt}
  9783: |-
    Chasseuses de péchés Mithra !
    Alors Prishe a déjà été… punie !?${prompt}
  9784: |-
    Bien sûr que non, Maître Cid !
    Cependant, nous avons réussi à la trouver !${prompt}
  9785: Mais maintenant, elle a encore disparu… Et elle a emporté la magicite avec elle !${prompt}
  9786: |-
    Ulmia !?
    Hm ? Et qui pourraient être ces trois-là ?${prompt}
  9787: Ce sont les Traqueuses Mithra – des chasseuses de péchés venues de la patrie Mithra pour trouver… Prishe.${prompt}
  9788: |-
    Chasseuses de péchés !
    Qu’a donc fait Prishe aux Mithra !?
    Attends, ça veut dire que vous l’avez trouvée ?${prompt}
  9789: Oui, nous avons pu la localiser.${prompt}
  9790: Cependant, elle est repartie seule… avec la magicite…${prompt}
  9791: La magicite ! Donne-moi les détails, Ulmia.${prompt}
  9792: |-
    Je vois…
    Je n’avais pas réalisé que la magicite de Tavnazia était aussi puissante… ou aussi dangereuse.${prompt}
  9793: Donc, c’est l’énergie de cette pierre qui a affecté les membres de l’Expédition Multinationale – elle a envahi leurs cœurs et leurs esprits, les poussant finalement à commettre l’impensable.${prompt}
  9794: Exactement. Notre rrrreprésentant dans cette expédition a trouvé un éclat de magicite et l’a ramené dans notre patrie. C’est alors que nous aussi, nous avons réalisé son pouvoir terrifiant.${prompt}
  9795: Cependant, on ne nous a jamais dit d’où provenait cet éclat. D’autres expéditions Mithra ont été envoyées dans les Terres du Nord pour enquêter sur les origines de la pierre, mais sans succès.${prompt}
  9796: Non, c’est une tout autre investigation qui nous a conduit à la réponse. En cherchant la rrrrelique du dragon volée au Temple d’Uggalepih, nous avons trouvé ce que nous cherchions.${prompt}
  9797: |-
    Vous…
    Vous avez rencontré Prishe et la Cardinale Mildaurion dans la Cathédrale de Tavnazia ?${prompt}
  9798: Après un peu de… persuasion, la cardinale nous a montré ce qu’ils appelaient l’“Étoile de Tavnazia”. En d’autres termes – la magicite.${prompt}
  9799: Nous lui avons parlé du pouvoir terrifiant contenu dans la magicite et exigé qu’elle s’en débroussse quelque part où on ne la reverrait jamais.${prompt}
  9800: Cependant, la cardinale n’a pas voulu écouter la rrrraison.${prompt}
  9801: Elle n’a dit que la pierre était nécessaire pour réveiller les dieux de leur sommeil éternel.${prompt}
  9802: Réveiller les dieux… ? Mais c’est… !${prompt}
  9803: Je n’ai pas pu me résoudre à croire les paroles de Mademoiselle Shikaree non plus. Pas avant d’avoir entendu la même histoire de la Cathédrale de San d’Oria…${prompt}
  9804: Les hymnes que le chœur de Tavnazia chantait… Leurs mots avaient le pouvoir de ramener les dieux à la vie.${prompt}
  9805: |-
    Une pierre…
    Une chanson…${prompt}
  9806: Attends ! Cette chanson que Prishe a chantée pour aider Selh’teus à s’échapper. Est-ce la même chanson ?${prompt}
  9807: Et donc, toute la chanson a été récitée… ?${prompt}
  9808: |-
    Non.
    Il y a un cinquième couplet… et seuls les dieux endormis le connaissent.${prompt}
  9809: Cependant, si quelqu’un venait à interroger le dieu qui s’est récemment réveillé dans la Chaîne d’Uleguerand, il ne s’agirait que d’une question de temps avant que le cinquième et dernier couplet ne soit chanté.${prompt}
  9810: |-
    Ou peut-être la femme à Sel–
    Non, je ne peux pas encore vous confier cette information.
    Bonne journée.${prompt}
  9811: Maître Cid, je souhaite continuer ma recherche de Prishe avec les trois Traqueuses Mithra.${prompt}
  9812: Whoa, attends une seconde, Ulmia. Les traqueuses ne cherchent Prishe que pour… tu sais… la “punir”.${prompt}
  9813: Pour assurer sa sécurité, nous devons trouver Prishe avant que ces félines audacieuses ne le fassent.${prompt}
  9814: (C’est juste entre toi et moi, mais j’ai déjà discuté avec certains de mes… “connaissances” chez les Tenshodo et à Norg. Ils parcourent le continent à la recherche d’informations sur notre princesse aux cheveux bleus. S’ils trouvent quoi que ce soit, nous serons les premiers informés. C’est pourquoi tu dois rester ici – pour être là quand ces infos arriveront.)${prompt}
  9815: Merci, Maître Cid… pour tout…${prompt}
  9816: Et pour couronner le tout, nous avons un aventurier de premier ordre de notre côté. N’est-ce pas, ${name-player} ?${prompt}
  9817: ${choice-player-gender}[Il/Elle] va aller voir si Louverance a découvert quelque chose d’intéressant.${prompt}
  9818: Je ne suis toujours pas trop sûr de pourquoi Prishe s’est enfuie avec ce fragment de l’“Étoile de Tavnazia”, mais je parie mon tablier que ça a un rapport avec cette Cardinale Mildaurion.${prompt}
  9819: ${name-player}. Louverance a dit qu’il cherchait la cardinale. Peut-être sait-il quelque chose qui pourrait être utile. Si tu te dépêches, tu pourrais le rattraper.${prompt}
  9820: Je ne suis toujours pas trop sûr de pourquoi Prishe s’est enfuie avec ce fragment de l’“Étoile de Tavnazia”, mais je parie mon tablier que ça a un rapport avec ce garçon, Selh’teus.${prompt}
  9821: Si Tenzen revient et que nous pouvons capturer ce soi-disant Gardien de l’Apocalypse à Movalpolos, les nuages qui entourent ce mystère dans lequel nous sommes plongés pourraient bien se dissiper.${prompt}
  9822: ${name-player}, Tenzen a dit qu’il se dirigeait vers le Plateau de La Theine pour trouver Carbuncle. Si tu te dépêches, tu pourrais le rejoindre.${prompt}
  9823: Raibaht, emmène Ulmia dans les quartiers de Cornelia et demande à la fille du président de préparer une chambre pour notre invitée.${prompt}
  9824: Oui, monsieur…${prompt}
  9825: ${name-player}, avec tout ce qu’elle a traversé, je ne pense pas qu’il serait sage d’informer Ulmia de ce que Tenzen a découvert pour l’instant.${prompt}
  9826: Nous ne pouvons pas tirer de conclusions sur le fait que Prishe soit le Gardien de l’Apocalypse sans entendre ce que notre ami de San d’Oria a à dire.${prompt}
  9827: |-
    Oncle Cid !
    Les Tenshodo viennent d’envoyer un message !
    Prishe a été repérée – à Jeuno !${prompt}
  9828: Quoi !?${prompt}
  9829: Prishe ? À Jeuno !?${prompt}
  9830: Ils lui ont dit qu’il y avait un mandat pour sa capture, mais elle n’a pas semblé écouter.${prompt}
  9831: Qu’est-ce qui ne va pas ? Pourquoi irait-elle risquer d’être capturée !?${prompt}
  9832: |-
    Jeuno…
    Peut-être… Peut-être qu’elle est allée rencontrer…${prompt}
  9833: Ulmia ? Y a-t-il quelque chose que nous devrions savoir ?${prompt}
  9834: Maître Cid ! Je dois partir pour Jeuno immédiatement !${prompt}
  9835: Ulmia !${prompt}
  9836: |-
    Ça ne sent pas bon…
    Raibaht ! Trouve Tenzen${choice: 1}[/ et Louverance] et dis-${choice: 1}[lui/leur] ce qui s’est passé. Puis dépêche-toi d’aller à Jeuno.${prompt}
  9837: 'Dis-${choice: 1}[lui/leur] de ne pas s’inquiéter pour Movalpolos. Je vais envoyer un groupe de Mousquetaires… non, de Mousquetaires dorés là-bas tout de suite.${prompt}'
  9838: ${name-player}. Tu ferais mieux d’aller à Jeuno aussi.${prompt}
  9839: Si tu ne trouves pas Prishe, nous nous retrouverons tous devant le Palais du Grand Duc pour planifier notre prochain mouvement.${prompt}
  9840: Si elle a déjà été capturée, je peux te garantir qu’elle sera quelque part dans ce bâtiment.${prompt}
  9841: ${name-player} ! Où étais-tu !?${prompt}
  9842: J’ai entendu ce qui s’est passé, mais je n’arrive toujours pas à y croire…${prompt}
  9843: Apprendre que Prishe était vraiment le Gardien de l’Apocalypse m’a fait tomber de ma chaise…${prompt}
  9844: Mais découvrir que l’officielle de Jeuno, Esha’ntarl, est en réalité la Cardinale Mildaurion, et qu’elle est vivante depuis dix mille ans… c’était comme si une enclume m’était tombée sur la tête.${prompt}
  9845: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Je veux entendre ce qui t’est arrivé aussi. Appelle tous les autres.${prompt}
  9846: Hmmm. Alors voilà ce qui s’est passé…${prompt}
  9847: Pour honorer le pacte conclu il y a plus de dix mille ans entre Bahamut et Selh’teus, Mildaurion a tenté de ressusciter le Divin Promathia…${prompt}
  9848: Et la magicite enchâssée dans la poitrine de Prishe n’était qu’une forme cristallisée et scellée de son Vide intérieur.${prompt}
  9849: Nous, chasseuses de péchés, avons nous-mêmes commis un grave péché en ne parvenant pas à rester calmes et concentrées en présence de la magicite.${prompt}
  9850: |-
    Pas une seule plainte… Pas un seul cri à l’aide…
    Tout ce temps à porter un terrible fardeau… seule…${prompt}
  9851: Et Ulmia ? Elle connaît Prishe depuis qu’elle est enfant. Elle l’a vue lutter en silence.${prompt}
  9852: Ces nouvelles vérités doivent être aussi douloureuses pour elle que pour Prishe.${prompt}
  9853: Je ne pourrais souhaiter un destin aussi terrible même à un ennemi.${prompt}
  9854: Que devons-nous faire maintenant ?${prompt}
  9855: Phœnix m’a dit que nous ne devons plus provoquer Bahamut davantage.${prompt}
  9856: Cependant, la plus grande menace pour l’humanité est la magie aérienne du Roi Wyrm.${prompt}
  9857: Si nous pouvions le vaincre, cela améliorerait nos chances de victoire contre les armées de wyrms.${prompt}
  9858: Et donc, nous sommes laissés avec trois choix.${prompt}
  9859: Nous pouvons laisser le destin suivre son cours et attendre que Bahamut et ses sbires nous détruisent…${prompt}
  9860: Nous pouvons utiliser mon vaisseau pour rejoindre l’armada de Jeuno et combattre le Roi Wyrm…${prompt}
  9861: Ou nous pouvons réciter le cinquième couplet du “Memoria de la S^tona” et invoquer le Dieu du Crépuscule sur Prishe…${prompt}
  9862: |-
    Dieu du Crépuscule…
    Il a maudit… l’humanité… Nous a fait… combattre…${prompt}
  9863: Si nous… le vainquons… la malédiction… sera brisée…${prompt}
  9864: Mais… avons-nous… le pouvoir… ?${prompt}
  9865: Prishe a dit que ${name-player} avait ce pouvoir.${prompt}
  9866: Et nous avons Phœnix de notre côté !${prompt}
  9867: Mais je ne suis pas sûr que cela suffise…${prompt}
  9868: Diabolos, maître des rêves, nous a avertis qu’aucun enfant de Vana’diel seul ne pourrait vaincre la Gardienne de l’Apocalypse.${prompt}
  9869: Et pourtant, ma lame reste silencieuse…${prompt}
  9870: Nous sommes sur le point d’emprunter un chemin très dangereux…${prompt}
  9871: Mais je pense qu’il serait sage d’attendre le retour de Prishe avant d’agir.${prompt}
  9872: Tenzen, Mesdames les Chasseuses de Péchés, ${name-player}…${prompt}
  9873: Dépêchez-vous d’aller à Tavnazia et attendez Prishe. Quand elle arrivera, contactez-moi et je volerai jusqu’à l’archipel avec mon vaisseau.${prompt}
  9874: Tavnazia ? Mais pourquoi irais-tu là-bas ?${prompt}
  9875: L’aide de Gilgamesh devrait arriver au refuge sous peu.${prompt}
  9876: Disons simplement que les pièces qu’ils transporteront sont très… « sensibles ».${prompt}
  9877: On se retrouve tous au Repaire du Lion de Mer !${prompt}
  9878: Bienvenue à tous !${prompt}
  9879: Je suis content de voir que vous êtes tous sains et saufs. Je suis désolé de ne pas avoir pu vous rejoindre à Tavnazia.${prompt}
  9880: Cid ! Laisse tomber les bavardages et fais tourner le moteur de ton tas de ferraille !${prompt}
  9881: Du calme, petite dame. Tu viens juste de rentrer. Ne me dis pas que tu es prête à retourner dans les nuages.${prompt}
  9882: Je pensais qu’on laissait Bahamut à l’armada.${prompt}
  9883: |-
    C’est le cas !
    Notre destination est la Gardienne de l’Apocalypse et Nag’molada !${prompt}
  9884: Nag’molada… a envahi Movalpolos… bloqué l’entrée… au cinquième cristal… A blessé des amis…${prompt}
  9885: Mais il reste un moyen. Phœnix nous guidera !${prompt}
  9886: Le cinquième cristal-mère ? N’est-il pas censé être quelque part sous Shu’Meyo ?${prompt}
  9887: Maintenant que tu le mentionnes, je viens de recevoir un rapport disant qu’une étrange lumière rouge a commencé à jaillir de la mer du nord.${prompt}
  9888: |-
    Une lumière ?
    C’est ça ! Allons-y ! Allez ! Allez !${prompt}
  9889: Tiens tes chevaux, Prishe. Mon oiseau est encore sacrément amoché, et ça va prendre un peu plus de temps pour le remettre en état.${prompt}
  9890: |-
    Hein !?
    Mais on est si près, bon sang !${prompt}
  9891: D’ici à ce que les rrréparations soient terminées, l’armada sera déjà partie pour Bahamut…${prompt}
  9892: |-
    Et le vaisseau de Cid est le seul assez rapide et robuste pour faire le voyage.
    On dirait que notre chance s’est enfin épuisée.${prompt}
  9893: Non. Je ne peux pas croire qu’Altana nous ait tourné le dos.${prompt}
  9894: Je crois que la déesse nous a accordé ce temps pour préparer nos cœurs et nos âmes à ce qui pourrait être la bataille finale.${prompt}
  9895: |-
    Du temps…
    Je vais utiliser… ce temps pour… guérir mes amis…${prompt}
  9896: Et moi, je vais utiliser ce temps pour aider Cid avec les réparations du vaisseau !${prompt}
  9897: Hah hah hah ! Une main supplémentaire est toujours la bienvenue. Ça commence à ressembler au plus gros boulot de réparation de l’histoire de Vana’diel !${prompt}
  9898: Et je ne parle pas seulement du vaisseau ! Il est temps de sortir et de sauver le monde !${prompt}
  9899: Tu m’as volé les mots de la bouche, vieux bonhomme ! Vana’diel n’est pas encore fini ! Pas tant que j’ai mon mot à dire !${prompt}
  9900: |-
    ${name-player} !
    Es-tu prêt à aller botter des fesses apocalyptiques !?${prompt}
  9901: |-
    Alors ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Allons leur faire voir l’enfer !
    Faut-il vraiment y aller maintenant ?${prompt}
  9902: Heh heh ! Tu m’as volé les mots de la bouche !${prompt}
  9903: |-
    Hein !?
    Tu ne vas pas te défiler cette fois, ${name-player} ! On a besoin de toi !${prompt}
  9904: D’accord, tout le monde, vous avez entendu Ulmia ! Sortez et faites ce que vous avez à faire. Quand mon bébé sera prêt, je vous appellerai !${prompt}
  9905: Les réparations de mon oiseau avancent plus facilement que je n’aurais jamais pu l’imaginer. Avec toute la confusion à Jeuno, personne n’a le temps de se plaindre d’un vol d’essai non autorisé de temps en temps ! Hah hah hah !${prompt}
  9906: Ouais, mais pour être honnête, je suis sacrément content d’avoir pu retrouver Prishe. C’est une fille d’enfer. Ça ne me surprendrait pas qu’elle sauve Vana’diel de ses propres mains !${prompt}
  9907: Eh bien, ça termine notre entretien des canons.${prompt}
  9908: Les vieilles filles ont été bien entretenues. Elles devraient tenir le coup si le besoin s’en fait sentir.${prompt}
  9909: J’espère juste que rien d’aussi grave n’arrivera jamais.${prompt}
  9910: Je suis d’accord.${prompt}
  9911: |-
    Mais nous devons rester sur nos gardes.
    Ce repaire de bêtes est apparu du jour au lendemain, juste devant notre porte…${prompt}

    Salutations, aventurier.
    Es-tu venu chercher du travail ?${prompt}
  9913: |-
    Cherches-tu du travail ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Maintenant que tu le mentionnes…
    Pas aujourd’hui…${prompt}
  9914: J’ai une tâche parfaitement adaptée à un aventurier.${prompt}
  9915: As-tu entendu parler du repaire de Gobelins qui est soudainement apparu dans Gustaberg Nord ?${prompt}
  9916: Selon les érudits, les Gobelins vivant dans ce repaire forment une tribu distincte connue sous le nom de Moblins.${prompt}
  9917: Les Gobelins évitent habituellement de se rassembler et de construire des colonies, mais il semble que ces Moblins aient une structure sociale très différente.${prompt}
  9918: Avec plusieurs d’entre eux vivant à Jeuno, on peut dire que nous sommes en termes beaucoup plus amicaux avec les Gobelins qu’avec les autres races de bêtes.${prompt}
  9919: Cependant, il y a encore beaucoup de choses que nous ignorons sur les Moblins.${prompt}
  9920: Afin d’éviter des effusions de sang inutiles, nous devons déterminer s’ils nourrissent ou non des intentions hostiles envers nous.${prompt}
  9921: |-
    Les préparatifs pour une action militaire sont en cours.
    Mais d’abord, nous souhaitons demander à des aventuriers comme toi de mener une enquête approfondie.${prompt}
  9922: Entreprendras-tu cette tâche ?${prompt}
  9923: |-
    Le feras-tu ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  9924: |-
    Excellent.
    Veuillez vous rapporter à l’érudit au Restaurant du Mouton Vapeur pour plus de détails.${prompt}

    Je suis désolé d’entendre ça.
    Assure-toi de me reparler si tu changes d’avis.${prompt}

    Un repaire de bêtes est apparu dans Gustaberg Nord.
    Les Gobelins vivant dans ce repaire forment une tribu distincte connue sous le nom de Moblins.${prompt}
  9927: Veuillez vous rapporter à l’érudit au Restaurant du Mouton Vapeur pour plus de détails sur votre tâche.${prompt}
  9928: |-
    …Unité de propulsion à cristal…
    …Scientifiques encapuchonnés…${prompt}
  9929: |-
    …
    Tu dois me promettre de ne dire à personne ce que je vais te révéler.${prompt}
  9930: |-
    …
    Souviens-toi, tu ne dois dire à personne que le chef construit un nouveau vaisseau.${prompt}
  9931: Currently, the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, in conjunction with the air travel agency, has formed a monopoly on all forms of airship travel.${prompt}
  9932: To compete against Jeuno's empire in the skies, we must reinforce our research in aeronautics development. However, if the Duchy were to learn of our actions, they would not be pleased.${prompt}
  9933: That is why our chief has gone to great lengths to keep his acquisition of an out-of-service airship a secret to all but those who need to know.${prompt}
  9934: And that is why we must not draw any attention to ourselves by collecting large quantities of materials at one time.${prompt}
  9935: 'However, our supply of ${item-plural: 1[2]} has almost run dry. If we don''t have enough of that item, we cannot continue our modifications of the airship.${prompt}'
  9936: 'To help the chief with his airship modification project, we need a large quantity of ${item-plural: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  9937: However, we do not want to draw any unwanted attention to ourselves by importing through Jeuno...${prompt}
  9938: |-
    This is exactly what the chief needs for his project.
    The Republic thanks you for your assistance.${prompt}
  9939: It is not much, but here is a bit of reimbursement.${prompt}
  9940: |-
    ...
    We have a slight problem...
    The chief asked an adventurer to bring him a highly advanced altimeter from Jeuno.${prompt}
  9941: However, while the adventurer was traveling through the Duchy, he was stopped and arrested for attempting to transport the restricted item.${prompt}
  9942: 'While the adventurer was able to hide the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} before he was taken into custody, he has been ordered to defeat an unknown beast in Delkfutt''s Tower before he can return home.${prompt}'
  9943: 'We do not have the time to wait for him, and that is why we need your assistance again. Would you travel to Delkfutt''s Tower, ask the adventurer where he hid the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, then find it and bring it back here?${prompt}'
  9944: 'You may use this ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}. If you put the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} in it, the Ducal Guard and the customs officials at the air travel agency should not find the item.${prompt}'
  9945: |-
    Accept the job?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  9946: The adventurer we seek has been ordered to defeat a monster known as Orna. Find the monster...and you will find him.${prompt}
  9947: The adventurer we seek has been ordered to travel to Delkfutt's Tower and defeat a monster known as Orna.${prompt}
  9948: 'Find that man and have him tell you where he hid the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  9949: With this, the chief will be able to improve on his current theories and further develop new aerodynamic technologies.${prompt}
  9950: Again, it is not much, but please accept this reward for your services.${prompt}
  9951: The chief's theories are flawless. However, there remains one mountain he still must conquer.${prompt}
  9952: I don't know the details, but the chief has been up day and night trying to solve this final problem.${prompt}
  9953: Normally at times like these, I would not bother him...${prompt}
  9954: But I fear that this may be too difficult for the chief to handle on his own. Even Lady Cornelia has begun to worry about her father's long-time friend.${prompt}
  9955: After watching the chief for the past few weeks, I think I came to realize what was troubling him.${prompt}
  9956: Until recently, Chief Cid had been working on what he called a “semiperpetual motion engine.” However, after months of making little or no progress, he finally gave up on the idea.${prompt}
  9957: 'If he were only able to acquire the ${item-singular: 1[2]} that had been used in previous semiperpetual motion experiments...${prompt}'
  9958: It is said that the ancients were able to process the material and harness its hidden power, but since then, no one has succeeded in reproducing those results.${prompt}
  9959: |-
    This...
    The ${item-singular: 1[2]} of legend!
    But it cannot be...${prompt}
  9960: Let us show it to the chief and see what he has to say.${prompt}
  9961: 'Chief Cid. ${name-player} has found what ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] claims is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  9962: |-
    What!?
    But I thought that stone no longer remained on Vana'diel!${prompt}
  9963: |-
    Amazing...
    Just as the legends say.
    This heat that the ${item-singular: 1[2]} produces... Where does it come from?${prompt}
  9964: You have done well, ${name-player}. Now the chief can continue his experiments.${prompt}
  9965: 'Chief Cid. With the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, your dream of building a semiperpetual motion engine will finally be realized.${prompt}'
  9966: |-
    Hm? The what?
    Oh, that project? I gave up on that weeks ago.
    But this stone... Just think of all the possibilities!${prompt}

    Je vois.
    Cette vieille lettre est à l’origine de tout ça.${prompt}

  10046: Vous parlez du partenaire de Goldmane, Ismenios Cutsilver ?${prompt}
  10047: |-
    Exactement.
    Ismenios était le fils du Praefactus Leonnel de la marine bastokienne, et un ancien élève à moi.${prompt}
  10048: Ismenios a terminé sa formation à la Caserne des Recrues Navales avec les plus grands honneurs et le potentiel pour devenir un commandant exceptionnel.${prompt}
  10049: Puis un jour, apparemment lassé de la vie navale, il a annoncé qu’il quitterait le commandement du Praefactus Leonnel pour devenir chasseur de primes.${prompt}
  10050: Le Praefactus Leonnel n’a rien fait pour retrouver son fils.${prompt}
  10051: |-
    Mais j’avais combattu aux côtés de Leonnel pendant la Grande Guerre, et j’avais appris à bien le connaître.
    Je voyais qu’il souffrait en silence.${prompt}
  10052: Avec l’aide de Goldmane, j’ai convaincu Ismenios de revenir à Bastok.${prompt}
  10053: Quelle que soit la situation, les parents s’inquiètent toujours pour leurs enfants, kupopo.${prompt}
  10054: '...${prompt}'
  10055: Mais connais-tu toute l’histoire, jeune fille ?${prompt}
  10056: Avant son voyage de retour, Ismenios Cutsilver a perdu la vie lors de la capture d’Atarefaunet.${prompt}
  10057: L’enquête des Mousquetaires sur l’incident a révélé que Goldmane était responsable de la mort d’Ismenios.${prompt}
  10058: |-
    Le Praefactus Leonnel ne s’abaisserait jamais à quelque chose d’aussi mesquin que la vengeance.
    Mais il n’a jamais pardonné à Goldmane.${prompt}
  10059: Vous comprenez donc qu’il est impossible que l’homme que vous cherchez soit sous la protection de la marine bastokienne.${prompt}
  10060: Alors où sur Vana’diel Goldmane pourrait-il bien se cacher… ?${prompt}
  10061: Eh bien, maintenant que vous en parlez…${prompt}
  10062: Il y a eu des rumeurs disant que les derniers sbires de la bande d’Atarefaunet fouinent dans les parages à la recherche de votre insaisissable chasseur de primes.${prompt}
  10063: Des murmures dans les recoins sombres les placent sur la piste du propriétaire de l’Île de Purgonorgo, dans la Baie de Bibiki.${prompt}

  10071: |-
    Quoi qu’il en soit, merci pour votre don.
    Tenez, prenez ceci. Nous avons découvert quelques trucs en étudiant la composition de ces machins.${prompt}
  10072: Bien qu’on ne s’en douterait pas à les voir, ces petites pierres renferment une énorme quantité de données – le genre qu’on trouve dans de puissantes armes biotechnologiques. Malheureusement, ce n’est pas mon domaine de prédilection.${prompt}
  10073: Cependant, quand j’étais à Jeuno à travailler sur le développement des vaisseaux du Duché, j’ai eu l’occasion de voir la technologie des fragments à l’œuvre.${prompt}
  10074: Et d’après ce que j’ai vu, il est évident que les hommes et femmes impliqués dans ce projet ne pensaient pas à la paix ni à la prospérité pour l’humanité entière.${prompt}
  10075: C’est pourquoi j’utilise ces fragments pour essayer de mettre au point un moyen de neutraliser ces armes… au cas où cela deviendrait nécessaire.${prompt}
  10076: Cette pompe n’est qu’un prototype, mais elle pourrait vous être utile si vous vous retrouvez dans une situation périlleuse.${prompt}
  10077: Je vais continuer mes recherches, alors si vous trouvez d’autres fragments, apportez-les à mon laboratoire, et je vous tiendrai au courant de mes dernières avancées.${prompt}
  10078: Ah, un autre lot de fragments. Merci, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10079: Mais ça veut dire… que tu as dû utiliser la pompe…${prompt}

    À vrai dire, il est encore plus endommagé que je ne le pensais.

  10083: C’est l’unité de propulsion à cristal. Le cœur de mon bel oiseau est en miettes.${prompt}
  10084: Tenzen semblait croire qu’on pourrait trouver une solution à Jeuno, mais je n’ai plus vu l’ombre de son sabre depuis qu’il est parti.${prompt}
  10085: Hmmm. Si j’avais un appareil plus simple qui montre comment les anciens amplifiaient la puissance des cristaux, je pourrais peut-être réparer l’unité de propulsion moi-même…${prompt}
  10086: Bah, ça ne sert à rien de rassembler plus de provisions pour l’instant. Peux-tu aller dire à Louverance et aux filles de rentrer à Bastok ?${prompt}
  10087: Louverance devrait être près du Quai des Charpentiers à chercher du bois, et Shikaree Z est partie dans la Baie de Bibiki pour trouver des minerais spéciaux.${prompt}

  10587: My wife is an excellent cook, even better than my mother.${prompt}
  10588: My son Pabro isn't picky and scarfs down whatever my wife makes for him.${prompt}
  10589: My daughter Erba is unselfish and treasures the things she has, even the clothes she owns. Hahaha! My family is great!${prompt}

  10602: Really? Thank you!${prompt}

  10606: Why yes, of course! You can have the charm for luck in general! That should protect you against anything!${prompt}

  10609: What? Are you trying to pull a fast one on me?${prompt}
  10610: O-of course not! The general luck charm is splenderiffic stuff, created by the casting of countless incantations!${prompt}
  10611: I see. Well, I don't want to be troubled by that stalker again, that's for sure! I'll take them all.${prompt}

  10617: Salim, if you refuse, I'll have to remove the trap from the Temple of the Goddess.${prompt}

  10788: I once imparted to you the teachings of my master--“Only you can decide which roads in life you will tread.”${prompt}
  10789: He also taught me, “The river has many branches, but they all flow into the sea.”${prompt}

    Good craftsmanship takes time, but I'll be done before you know it.
    Why don't you head to the Markets and try to catch yourself a gold carp or two while you wait?${prompt}
  10807: |-
    Don't you know better than to rush a master at work?
    Just a bit longer, I say!${prompt}
  10808: |-
    I was wondering when you'd come back.
    Here you are, one order of ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}, just like we used to make 'em!${prompt}
  10809: |-
    I even took the liberty of making a few improvements to the old recipe.
    One blast from these and even the most potent magical armor will be reduced to little more than scrap metal.${prompt}

    My fee? Hah! Don't mention it!
    I haven't enjoyed my work this much in years.
    If you come across any other curiosities, you know where to find me!${prompt}
  10811: Press button to proceed.${prompt}
  10812: |-
    Greetings, friend. I am Registrar Cloud Walker.
    My duty is to issue marriage certificates to married couples.${prompt}
  10813: What can I do for you today?${prompt}
  10814: |-
    The marriage certificate is a legal document issued in recognition of the matrimony of two individuals.
    It can also be used as a wall decoration for your Mog House.${prompt}
  10815: Couples wishing to receive the certificate must show proof of their marriage, and this can be done in a number of ways.${prompt}
  10816: |-
    The couple should form a party while the husband is wearing his ${color: 5}matrimony ring${color: 1}, and his wife, her ${color: 5}matrimony band${color: 1}.
    After that, speak to me, and I'll draw up the certificates for you.${prompt}
  10817: 'But if you possess a ${color: 5}wedding ring${color: 1}, the procedure can be completed on your own.${prompt}'
  10818: |-
    Keep in mind though, that you can't have more than one certificate at any given time.
    Also, the nation of issuance for your certificate must be the same as your partner's.${prompt}
  10819: One last thing. A misplaced certificate can be reissued, but only by the same officiating body that you originally received it from.${prompt}
  10820: A wedding is a joyful occasion in which two souls brought together by fate are joined as partners in life.${prompt}
  10821: In Bastok, it's customary for the bride and groom to swear an oath of endless love in the presence of witnesses. After which, wedding rings are exchanged.${prompt}
  10822: 'To conclude the proceedings, all those present join in a toast with ${color: 5}bottles of grape juice${color: 1} in hand and share in the newly joined couple''s happiness.${prompt}'
  10823: 'First of all, you''ll need to prepare wedding rings--a ${color: 5}matrimony ring${color: 1} and a ${color: 5}matrimony band${color: 1}, to be precise.${prompt}'
  10824: As their synthesis requires rare, hard-to-find ingredients, there truly is no better token of undying devotion between two people.${prompt}
  10825: |-
    Before you present the ring to your partner, you should consider engraving your name onto it using a ${color: 5}cyclone crystal${color: 1}.
    This practice is widespread among adventurers nowadays.${prompt}
  10826: 'You''ll also find that ${color: 5}benedight coats${color: 1} and ${color: 5}wedding dresses${color: 1} are popular as ceremonial attire for men and women, respectively.${prompt}'
  10827: Similar garments exist that can be synthesized. Whether you perform the synthesis yourself or employ a friend to do so, though, is entirely your decision. Gathering the needed ingredients can be pricey, but it's for this reason they're highly valued.${prompt}
  10828: |-
    There's no need to feel dejected, though, if they don't fall within your budget.
    There's no law dictating what couples have to wear at their own wedding, after all.${prompt}
  10829: If you have trouble obtaining any of the ceremonial items I've mentioned, they can also be purchased from the chests you see here.${prompt}
  10830: 'Fireworks, ${color: 5}wedding bells${color: 1}, and the like are also available to help add flavor to your special day, so feel free to purchase whatever you need.${prompt}'
  10831: |-
    It looks like you already have a marriage certificate in your possession.
    I'm afraid I'm not authorized to issue you another.${prompt}
  10832: 'Your current job level must be level ${number: 2} or higher if you wish to receive a marriage certificate.${prompt}'
  10833: I'm afraid I'm not authorized to issue you a marriage certificate.${prompt}
  10834: 'Married couples wishing to receive marriage certificates should form a party while the husband is wearing his ${color: 5}matrimony ring${color: 1}, and his wife, her ${color: 5}matrimony band${color: 1}. After that, speak to an official in charge, and the certificates will be drawn up for you.${prompt}'
  10835: |-
    It looks like you've already been issued a marriage certificate by another nation.
    A misplaced certificate can be reissued, but only by the same officiating body that you originally received it from.${prompt}
  10836: It looks like your spouse's marriage certificate was issued by another nation.${prompt}
  10837: |-
    It looks like your spouse's marriage certificate was issued by another nation.
    If you want one of your own, you'll have to speak with the same officiating body that issued your spouse's.${prompt}
  10838: |-
    Accepting a marriage certificate from our nation will render you ineligible to receive one from another.
    Also, the nation of issuance for your marriage certificate must be the same as your partner's.${prompt}
  10839: Accepting a marriage certificate from our nation will render you ineligible to receive one from another.${prompt}
  10840: By the power vested in me by the Republic of Bastok, I hereby pronounce you husband and wife.${prompt}
  10841: You are all now officially permitted to eat, drink, sing, and have a joyous night!${prompt}
  10842: |-

  10852: Hm? Business with the president, ye say?${prompt}
  10853: Iron Eater! What's the disturbance here?${prompt}
  10854: Sir Lucius. This adventurer here's brought a curious document.${prompt}
  10855: Let me see that.${prompt}
  10856: |-
    The two-headed serpent...?
    This is the seal of the Empire of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  10857: Come with me at once.${prompt}
  10858: '...That will do.${prompt}'
  10859: How do you read this matter, Lucius?${prompt}
  10860: |-
    This young Empress is either a fool, or she takes us for one.
    I say she's plotting something.${prompt}
  10861: |-
    One thing is clear.
    This colossus has the power to bring down an airship as easily as a musketeer would fell a pigeon.${prompt}
  10862: We may have escaped without casualties once, but there is no guarantee we would be so fortunate a second time.${prompt}
  10863: |-
    Bastok declines the Empire's request.
    Take your document and be off with you.${prompt}
  10864: Mister President!${prompt}
  10865: |-
    You sent me to the Empire to observe Nashmeira's coronation.
    Now hear me when I say that I saw no deception in her eyes.${prompt}
  10866: |-
    I saw one pure of heart.
    One who, despite her tender years, is possessed of the strength and conviction to unite a nation.${prompt}
  10867: '...${prompt}'
  10868: |-
    A leader beloved and trusted by her people.
    A leader who now earnestly seeks our aid.${prompt}
  10869: If we refuse, would we not risk alienating one who might prove to be a steadfast ally?${prompt}
  10870: '...${prompt}'
  10871: Your words ring true, Volker.${prompt}
  10872: |-
    And yet I cannot agree.
    As President, I will not take a course of action that would place my citizens in harm's way.${prompt}
  10873: '...Your Excellency.${prompt}'
  10874: Lucius?${prompt}
  10875: I can scarce believe what I am saying, but...if Captain Volker is so convinced of the Empire's good faith, perhaps we should reconsider.${prompt}
  10876: |-
    Two of my most trusted advisors now tell me to blindly accept this Empress's words.
    What say you, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  10877: |-
    Can Nashmeira be trusted?
    ${selection-lines}
    I swear on my life.
    On second thought...${prompt}
  10878: Hmph...and what would a run-of-the-mill adventurer like you know?${prompt}
  10879: Hmph. I stand in the company of reckless fools...${prompt}
  10880: Hmph. I stand in the company of reckless fools...${prompt}
  10881: What are you thinking, ${name-player}!?${prompt}
  10882: '...Very well. You have my permission.${prompt}'
  10883: Volker. The moment anything--anything, I say--goes awry, you will take responsibility.${prompt}
  10884: Mister President, sir!${prompt}
  10885: My friends. I am pleased to see your safe return.${prompt}
  10886: Never would I have suspected that Captain Klara was possessed by one of those foul creatures...${prompt}
  10887: And yet, reflecting back on the past months, it explains much.${prompt}
  10888: |-
    In my ignorance, I thought it merely the travails of war that weighed on her mind.
    To think that she was waging an even fiercer battle all this time. A battle for her very soul...${prompt}
  10889: |-
    The knowledge that she may lose herself completely, that at any moment she might turn her blade against her beloved comrades...
    It must have been harrowing, indeed.${prompt}
  10890: |-
    This I know: Klara is fortunate indeed to have friends such as you.
    Were it not for your efforts, there is little doubt we would have lost her long ago.${prompt}
  10891: On behalf of the entire republic, you have my gratitude.${prompt}
  10892: And yet, our battle is far from over.${prompt}
  10893: |-
    The latest report has just come in from the front lines.
    Thanks to the efforts of the Allied infiltration unit, we've finally secured a direct line of attack against the enemy stronghold.${prompt}
  10894: |-
    The Allied Forces will move against Castle Zvahl with the full brunt of its strength.
    I will personally lead the Republican Army in support of this offensive.${prompt}
  10895: |-
    I would have you march with me.
    Under normal circumstances, you'd have earned yourselves a rest for your efforts, but I'm afraid that is a luxury we cannot afford.${prompt}
  10896: Mister President...does this mean--?${prompt}
  10897: By presidential decree, the Mythril Mousquetaires are hereby reinstated in full.${prompt}
  10898: Zeid. Until such time as Captain Klara is fit to return to duty, I would have you serve as acting captain in her stead.${prompt}
  10899: |-
    Clearly, the bonds you share are as strong--nay, stronger--than the metal from which you take your name.
    Let these bonds of friendship be your strength, and even the darkest shadow will prove no match for you.${prompt}
  10900: Yes, sir!${prompt}
  10901: And you, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  10902: |-
    You hail from a distant realm, this I know.
    Despite this, you have made one sacrifice after the next in our Republic's name.${prompt}
  10903: It would be no exaggeration to say that without your unflagging efforts, Bastok would not stand as strong as it does today.${prompt}
  10904: As a token of my gratitude, I give you this.${prompt}
  10905: |-
    Furthermore, from this day forward you shall be a full-fledged member of the Mythril Mousquetaires.
    The Republic would have your strength for as long as it stands.${prompt}
  10906: Three cheers for Mythril Musketeer ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10907: |-
    They tell me our guardsman Gentle Tiger has dubbed you the Sixth Musketeer.
    I will do him one better: I hereby bestow upon you the designation of Mythril Musketeer Zero.${prompt}
  10908: |-
    A wayfarer from far-off lands you are, and yet serve our nation as loyally as any true Bastoker ever has.
    Never lose sight of your origins, for it is your unique background that allows you to serve us as no other can.${prompt}
  10909: |-
    Once a Mythril Musketeer, forever a Mythril Musketeer.
    The Republic is stronger for your presence, ${name-player}. Promise us that it will always be so.${prompt}
  10910: Simply incredible... Why, the zero designation is an honor that's been granted to only the most illustrious Mousquetaires in the history of our unit.${prompt}
  10911: |-
    I must confess to feeling a bit of jealousy, ${name-player}.
    But just you wait: I fully expect to distinguish myself in the none-too-distant future!${prompt}
  10912: |-
    ${name-player}.
    It has been--and always will be--an honor to fight by your side.${prompt}
  10913: They say that in the days of the Great War, there was a hero of the Republic who distinguished ${choice-player-gender}[himself/herself] so highly that ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] was bestowed the title of Mythril Musketeer Zero by President Prien himself.${prompt}
  10914: |-
    ${choice-player-gender}[His/Her] identity was never made public, and ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] remains the only one to this day to receive the honor.
    What I wouldn't give for the chance to meet such a legend!${prompt}
  10915: Cette chose stupide est tellement compliquée.
  10916: |-
    « Allez, Naji ! » « Ça va être facile, Naji ! »
    <Marmonne> Pourquoi ai-je même accepté ça ?
  10917: Qui m'a vraiment désigné volontaire, de toute façon ?
  10918: Et maintenant, j'ai quelqu'un qui me dérange. Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
  10919: Par Altana ! Quelqu'un est vraiment venu me parler de ce truc de « confiance » ?
  10920: On prend le taureau par les cornes, n'est-ce pas ? Je suppose que je peux trouver un peu de temps dans mon emploi du temps chargé.
  10921: Soyons clairs:je n'ai absolument aucune idée de comment ça fonctionne. Ils m'ont dit quelque chose sur la confiance et l'amitié, mais qu'est-ce que ça doit bien vouloir dire ?
  10922: Mais si ça fonctionne, tu pourras invoquer un « alter ego » de moi qui se battra à tes côtés. Et soyons honnêtes:qui mieux que moi ?
  10923: C'est ce qu'on m'a dit, en tout cas. Des trucs assez incroyables !
  10924: Mais je ne te connais pas plus qu'un gamin de la rue en larmes, donc ça ne fonctionnera probablement pas. Pas de chance, gamin.
  10925: Et puisque nous avons traversé des temps intéressants ensemble, ça pourrait être assez fou pour que ça marche !
  10926: Tu as été envoyé en mission de reconnaissance à San d'Oria et à Windurst à la demande du président Karst.
  10927: Tu sais que j'étais posté à ces portes pour garder les indésirables loin de lui, mais je savais que je pouvais compter sur toi, alors je t'ai laissé passer.
  10928: Tu te souviens de cette fois où Grand-mère t'a demandé de reforger l'épée de mon père ?
  10929: Tu as intérêt à avoir encore cette hache que je t'ai donnée ! Elle m'a bien aidé dans des moments difficiles au fil des ans, et je détesterais entendre qu'elle est entassée n'importe comment au fond de ton Mog Locker.
  10930: Tout ce débat avec le Roi de Cœurs et moi à Aht Urhgan a été un moment à se souvenir. Tu as de la chance qu'on ait réussi à te tirer de ce pétrin !
  10931: Tu m'as vraiment bien eu à cette course de chocobos, aussi. Ça m'a pris un moment pour te pardonner !
  10932: |-
    « Mais, Naji, c'était il y a longtemps ! »
    Bah ! La prochaine fois, tu ne seras pas aussi chanceux !
  10933: Ah, les souvenirs. Si j'étais un homme plus faible, ça pourrait même me faire pleurer.
  10934: Mais toute cette histoire de magie de la Confiance... les souvenirs seuls ne créent pas de liens forts ! Tu vas avoir besoin de bien plus que ça !
  10935: Iron Eater m'a toujours traité de bête comme un tronc d'arbre et simple comme une lance en bois, mais je tiens à te faire savoir que je suis à la fois complexe et raffiné !
  10936: Donc, ne m'en veux pas si ça échoue. C'est tout sur ta tête.
  10937: Maintenant, concentre-toi, mon compatriote ! Concentre-toi sur tes sentiments de confiance et d'amitié !
  10938: |-
    Si tu ne crois pas en moi, alors crois au fait que je crois en toi !
    Attends, qu'est-ce que je viens de dire ?
  10939: Tout ça pour ça ? Cet idiot de Clarion Star a donné une si longue explication « en quelque sorte » que j'étais prêt à rester ici pendant des heures et des heures !
  10940: Mais je serais damné si ça ne fait pas du bien. Essayons-le !
  10941: Hé, petit--reviens ici !!!
  10942: Ouf ! Ça aurait pu très mal finir. Au moins, je peux contrôler la chose.
  10943: Ha ! Maintenant, je peux garder deux portes en même temps ! Attends... pourquoi est-ce que je m'excite pour ça ?
  10944: Je suis le guerrier par excellence, numéro cinq dans la hiérarchie des Mousquetaires Mythril, et si je t'attrape à m'appeler portier, je te mords la tête !
  10945: Ugggh... ce truc de « portier » touche un peu trop près de chez moi.
  10946: Je suis prêt et gonflé à bloc ! Maintenant, il faut que je rattrape Ayame et lui dise ce que je ressens vraiment !
  10947: "Gah !\nJe suis d'accord pour que cette chose hérite de mes nombreux talents, mais certaines choses sont mieux gardées sous silence ! "
  10948: Maintenant, il faut que je fasse en sorte qu'elle ne me mette pas dans le pétrin !
  10949: |-
    Félicitations pour ton immense succès !
    Et avant que j'oublie, je dois te donner ça. Tu l'as bien mérité, mon pote !
  10950: Tu peux l'utiliser pour invoquer un alter ego du plus fort des Mousquetaires Mythril--moi--à tout moment.
  10951: Secoue-le en dehors de la ville. Peut-être au Nord ou au Sud de Gustaberg, par exemple. Je suis sûr que tu seras plus que satisfait du résultat.
  10952: Et loin de moi l'idée de confesser ma faiblesse... mais je suis un peu curieux de savoir si ça va vraiment fonctionner. Reviens me voir une fois que tu l'auras essayé.
  10953: Dis-moi le moindre détail ! Mon alter ego a-t-il rendu justice au vrai moi ?
  10954: |-
    Comment ça s'est passé ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Je ne pourrais pas être plus heureux.
    Eh bien... je ne suis pas très impressionné.
  10955: Je ne peux pas dire que ça m'étonne. Quand on travaille avec un homme comme moi, bien sûr que tu obtiendras de grands résultats. Maintenant, tu sais pourquoi Iron Eater a choisi celui qu'il a choisi !${prompt}
  10956: “Pas impressionné”? Arrête de babiller comme un bébé!${prompt}
  10957: Comment pourrais-tu ne pas être impressionné par quelqu'un d'aussi complexe et sophistiqué ?${prompt}
  10958: Quoi qu'il en soit, si tu as besoin d'en savoir plus sur la confiance, retourne juste demander à Clarion Star. Il a l'air d'en savoir beaucoup sur ce sujet.${prompt}
  10959: Il n'arrêtait pas de murmurer quelque chose sur le "potentiel latent" et "la recherche en cours" ou je ne sais quoi. Je ne faisais pas vraiment attention.${prompt}
  10960: Mais ce que j'ai trouvé intéressant, c'est qu'il y a aussi des gens d'autres nations qui ont les yeux rivés sur ce programme.${prompt}
  10961: Si tout ce processus me confond, ce n'est pas surprenant qu'il y ait des gens qui essaient de comprendre comment cela fonctionne.${prompt}
  10962: Mais tu n'as pas besoin de traverser la frontière pour en savoir plus. D'autres personnes ici à Bastok participent, comme... Ayame.${prompt}
  10963: Elle est numéro quatre ici chez les Mythril Mousquetaires, et je doute qu'elle laisse n'importe quel vieux aventurier essayer la magie de la confiance avec elle.${prompt}
  10964: |-
    T-tu veux que je lui demande pour toi ?
    Non, non, je ne pense pas que ce soit une bonne idée.${prompt}
  10965: Elle te connaît plutôt bien maintenant. Donne-lui juste un petit coup de pied pour moi quand tu iras la voir, d'accord ?${prompt}
  10966: |-
    Il y a autre chose que je dois te donner : cet ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.
    Eh bien, il n'y a rien de plus que tu puisses attendre de moi ici.${prompt}
  10967: Tu as ce que tu es venu chercher. Assure-toi juste de bien traiter mon alter ego, sinon je vais devoir te traquer... et tu ne seras pas content quand je te trouverai !${prompt}
  10968: |-
    C'est un plaisir de...
    Oh ? Tu as ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} ?${prompt}
  10969: J'assiste l'Institut de Magie de Jeuno dans la collecte de données sur cette nouvelle "magie de Confiance".${prompt}
  10970: L'une de mes fonctions en tant que membre de haut rang des Mousquetaires du Mythril est de m'assurer que nous sommes prêts à toute éventualité... et je crois fermement que cette nouvelle découverte pourrait bien nous être utile.${prompt}
  10971: J'espère ardemment qu'elle nous aidera dans nos luttes contre la Confédération des Bêtes. Sinon, peut-être qu'elle pourra au moins être utilisée pour nous assister dans certaines de nos tâches plus humbles.${prompt}
  10972: Si possible, j'aimerais solliciter ton aide dans cette entreprise.${prompt}
  10973: Mais malheureusement, il semble que cette magie nécessite un lien entre nous, un lien que nous ne partageons pas encore.${prompt}
  10974: 'Il y a d’autres choses dont tu dois t’occuper d’abord. Je te souhaite bonne chance dans tes efforts pour protéger ${choice: 5}[Bastok/ton pays natal].${prompt}'
  10975: Le fait même que tu sois venu me voir aujourd'hui ne peut signifier qu'une chose. Tu souhaites voir si tu peux invoquer mon alter ego.${prompt}
  10976: |-
    Tenter le rituel avec Ayame ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Tentons le coup.
    Pas pour le moment.${prompt}
  10977: Je te conseille de reconsidérer. Cette ville a besoin de plus de force et de détermination ; la dernière chose dont elle a besoin, c'est encore plus de Najis.${prompt}
  10978: Souviens-toi que cette magie puise dans la puissance des liens profondément personnels. Des liens qui peuvent à la fois apaiser le cœur et l'exciter.${prompt}
  10979: Revenons un instant sur tout ce qui s'est passé entre nous.${prompt}
  10980: Tu m'as sauvé des griffes terrifiantes d'un dragon au sanctuaire de Waughroon.${prompt}
  10981: Mon alter ego n'est qu'un reflet de moi-même. Si tu réussis à l'invoquer, elle se souviendra sûrement de tes actions.${prompt}

  10986: |-
    Si seulement la sombre face cachée de Bastok ne t'avait pas été révélée dans ce processus...
    Un jour, j'espère pouvoir la mener à sa conclusion légitime.${prompt}

  10991: Mon cœur a raté un battement quand j'ai entendu que l'aéronef était tombé comme un rocher dévalant une falaise.${prompt}
  10992: Qui pourrait oublier lorsque tu as vaincu Huu Xalmo le Sauvage, montrant ta véritable prouesse en tant que l'un des meilleurs moines du pays ?${prompt}
  10993: Tu as emprunté le chemin que mon prédécesseur Cornelia avait pris et tu l'as fait tien. En tant que membre des Mousquetaires Mythril, je comprends comme personne ce que signifie cette décision.${prompt}
  10994: Comment pourrais-je oublier que tu as battu Infinity XIII !?${prompt}

  11140: Hey there. Hm? What's that shield you're holding?${prompt}
  11141: Oh... I see you've met her already.${prompt}
  11142: Yeah, I heard the story about an amazing shield that boosts one's crafting ability just by equipping it. I never thought such a thing could be possible.${prompt}
  11143: I'd be curious to see if it actually works or not.${prompt}
  11144: I know you're quite skilled, and if she picked you, I guess it means you've got what it takes to make the shield.${prompt}
  11145: Alright then. Let's get you the recipe. Make sure you don't forget it, you hear?${prompt}
  11146: 'Okay, you''ll need some ingredients to get started. First on the list is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  11147: 'It''s necessary to boost the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its max value.${prompt}'
  11148: I've actually got some notes on Craftsmanship here. I'll go over 'em quickly with you before we continue.${prompt}
  11149: 'You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt}'
  11150: Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you have trouble.${prompt}
  11151: In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt}
  11152: You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt}
  11153: That's all it says.${prompt}
  11154: 'Come and see me when you get the Craftsmanship up. I''ll get that ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  11155: 'Next, you''ll need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. I''ve given them to Esvin.${prompt}'
  11156: You've made deliveries before, right? That's what you'll need to do to get the ingredients.${prompt}
  11157: You can talk to Esvin for more details.${prompt}
  11158: That's it for the ingredients. Come show me the shield after you've upgraded it. I want to see what all the fuss is about.${prompt}
  11159: Huh? You forgot the recipe? Fine. Here's the list of ingredients again. Try to remember it this time.${prompt}
  11160: Well, I guess I've never had any complaints with you. You know what you're doing, so I'm certain you can pull it off.${prompt}
  11161: 'Wow, this is quite impressive. I ought to be able to craft the ${item-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt}'
  11162: 'Okay, here''s the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11163: I poured my craftsman's spirit into the shield and it made this crystal. I've got no idea how it all works, but it's pretty amazing, no?${prompt}
  11164: 'Although, by creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it seems the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]} has decreased.${prompt}'
  11165: 'I guess it''s not a problem to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but you''ll need to raise the Craftsmanship if you want to craft ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} again.${prompt}'
  11166: Of course, I know you'd never do anything as stupid as to lose this. Hahaha.${prompt}
  11167: 'Hey! Are you trying to tell me you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?!${prompt}'
  11168: 'I guess it can''t be helped. Here, I''ll make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Let me see your shield.${prompt}'
  11169: You're one of my greatest rivals in this business. You should know to take proper care of your ingredients.${prompt}
  11170: I see you've made the upgrade. Let me see what you've got there.${prompt}
  11171: Hmm... It looks different, and it's even giving off a faint energy. It still doesn't seem to be complete though.${prompt}
  11172: I guess you're gonna have to craft with it multiple times to get the best results. She probably already told you that though.${prompt}
  11173: Oh yeah. You needed some kind of proof that the shield was made. Wait just a moment.${prompt}
  11174: That oughta do it.${prompt}
  11175: Just show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and you'll be set.${prompt}
  11176: By the way, I've always got deliveries to be made to Esvin. I hope you'll help me bring up the guild's newer members.${prompt}
  11177: Oh! You brought the shield with you. You must be here to upgrade it.${prompt}
  11178: I got the recipe, so let's take a look at it.${prompt}
  11179: That's it.${prompt}
  11180: 'Now for the ingredients... First, you''ll need to start with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  11181: 'You equipped the aspis when you made the ecu, right? This is basically the same thing. You''ll need to craft items while equipping the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11182: That'll increase its Craftsmanship for ya. Just keep at it until it reaches 100%.${prompt}
  11183: 'Come back when you''re done and I''ll prepare the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for ya.${prompt}'
  11184: 'After that, you''ll need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. I''ve given both of them to Esvin.${prompt}'
  11185: 'Last up is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. For this one, I''ve enlisted the help of the A.M.A.N. There''re a number of Records of Eminence objectives for you to complete.${prompt}'
  11186: 'Check the Records of Eminence for more details. If you see the objectives through to the end, you''ll get the ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt}'
  11187: That's it for the ingredients. It might be a bit tough, but I know you're up to the challenge.${prompt}
  11188: Ahh, it looks like you've brought the shield's Craftsmanship up.${prompt}
  11189: 'Okay, let''s get you that ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11190: Here you go!${prompt}
  11191: 'Oh, it looks like making the ${item-singular: 0[2]} caused the shield''s Craftsmanship to drop.${prompt}'
  11192: It takes a lot of work to get the shield's Craftsmanship up. So don't go do something stupid like losing this thing.${prompt}
  11193: This shield is really amazing. I wish I could carry it in my shop. Whaddya say? Interested in selling it to me?${prompt}
  11194: Hahaha! Just kidding. Seriously though, this shield possesses immense power. I look forward to seeing just how powerful it can become.${prompt}
  11195: Now, let's get you that proof that the shield is finished.${prompt}
  11196: I really hate to see this thing go... Take it over to Mewk Chorosap before I change my mind.${prompt}
  11197: I don't believe this... Fine, get out there and that final objective again!${prompt}
  11198: Ahh, it's good to see ya! Let's hurry up and get you that recipe.${prompt}
  11199: Hm? You already know the recipe? Oh, sorry about that. Is there something else you want to check?${prompt}
  11200: 'You want to know how to get the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}? I''ve got them, but I''m not gonna just give ''em to ya for free.${prompt}'
  11201: The Blacksmiths' Guild has received a number of orders for various products. I could use your help making the items and then delivering them to the customer.${prompt}
  11202: But keep in mind that the customer is demanding the items be made nearby. I guess it's in order to keep an eye on the quality of the finished goods.${prompt}
  11203: In other words, you can only deliver that which they've seen you craft. Although, products used for repairs can be taken directly to them.${prompt}
  11204: You'll need to gather the materials needed to make the item yourself. It doesn't matter how you do it, but there is at least a bit of good news for ya.${prompt}
  11205: It's still in the trial phase, but the guilds have agreed on a system to sell certain items that were previously unavailable. It might make it easier for you to get certain materials.${prompt}
  11206: Speak to the vendor in charge of crafting sets within each guild to see the available items. Of course, you'll need to pay for them first.${prompt}
  11207: But, note that you might not always be able to buy what you need. Each guild has its own set of rules.${prompt}

  11223: Maybe you should take a break for a while. You can take on another request once you've recovered.${prompt}
  11224: So, are you ready to get back at it? I've got the next request for you right here.${prompt}
  11225: Ah, it looks like you've completed the deliveries to the customer. Thanks for the help.${prompt}
  11226: It's good to see you. Looks like you've finished up the last delivery. I knew I could count on you.${prompt}

  11228: If you happen to lose them for some reason, you can always replace them by using guild points.${prompt}

  11230: So this is the new shield... Let me see it.${prompt}
  11231: Hahaha! It truly is a thing of beauty. It's surprisingly light for how big it is. I wonder if it could be used in battle.${prompt}
  11232: She thinks that the next upgrade will bring out the great power within the shield. At last, you've almost reached your destination!${prompt}
  11233: Oh, wait a moment. I've got a new crafting technique for you. You're skilled enough to be able to craft quality equipment with it. Give it a try if you're interested.${prompt}
  11234: Hey, it's good to see you again.${prompt}
  11235: Let's get down to it then. Here's how you go about getting the necessary materials.${prompt}
  11236: 'You''ll need both ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  11237: Like usual, you can get them by exchanging crafter points for them. Once you have enough, go see Esvin to make the trade.${prompt}
  11238: 'That just leaves the ${item-singular: 1[2]}. It''s also just like you remember. Boost your shield''s Craftsmanship to 100% and bring it to me.${prompt}'
  11239: That about covers it. Hang in there! You've almost reached the end of the journey!${prompt}
  11240: I was asked to give this to Mewk Chorosap. I suppose you already know that though. Here, get going already.${prompt}
  11241: Hey there. What do you need?${prompt}
  11242: Ah, you must be talking about that item the Tarutaru girl from Adoulin ordered. I really put my heart and soul into that thing.${prompt}
  11243: Actually, I already sent it off to Jeuno as per her request.${prompt}
  11244: I imagine it must've been delivered to Mewk Chorosap by now.${prompt}
  11245: 'Ah, it''s you again; perfect timing! Take a look at this. Somehow, the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you came to get was just hanging here on the wall of the guild.${prompt}'

    What's that you say?
    The Yagudo were searching for the egg in Windurst!?${prompt}

    So these beastmen are all trying to steal the egg for themselves.
    That means the Quadav probably are as well...${prompt}
  11413: You're talking about that trio that showed up where the egg was?${prompt}
  11414: And they worked together alongside the Orcs in the Northlands to break open the egg.${prompt}
  11415: |-
    So, if they've shown up here, then that means...
    Wait, could the egg be somewhere near Bastok?${prompt}
  11416: If so, then that might mean they're here to break open this egg for themselves.${prompt}

    Some legendary egg that gives untold power if broken open?
    I find it all rather hard to believe.${prompt}

    That Orc was destroyed when he broke open the egg.

    The mere thought of such a thing terrifies me.${prompt}

    I must tell my father about this “World Eater Egg” right away.
    The Quadav can wait.${prompt}
  11423: No, my lady. Like the other beastmen, the Quadav are also hoping to harness the egg's power.${prompt}
  11424: In fact, they may have already obtained that power.${prompt}

    So you mean they purposely showed up at the Zeruhn Mines in order to provoke us?
    That they are hoping to start a war?${prompt}
  11426: First, they lead the Republican military to the Palborough Mines, where they can use the egg's overwhelming power...${prompt}
  11427: Wait just a moment, Sir Volker, Iron Eater...${prompt}
  11428: Do you mean to say that my father intends to start a war?${prompt}
  11429: Um...${prompt}
  11430: |-
    I know that the Quadav are our sworn enemy.
    However, we must remain calm if we are to avoid needless bloodshed.${prompt}
  11431: |-
    Naturally, there are many who share your opinion, my lady.
    Whether they can sway the opinion of the Senate, however...${prompt}
  11432: We have to at least try! Once we set down the path to war, there's no turning back!${prompt}
  11433: They say victory favors those who move first.${prompt}
  11434: I realize I may be a young girl who knows little of the ways of the world...${prompt}
  11435: |-
    However, that is also why I can say what needs to be said.
    There are things that people must know if we are to go to war.${prompt}
  11436: What if you were to enlist ${name-player}'s services, my lady?${prompt}

    And if not, we need to know what their plans are.${prompt}
  11440: You must help us decide whether Bastok needs to engage the Quadav in all-out war.${prompt}
  11441: |-
    Will you agree to the request?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I'll do it.
    Sorry, I can't help you.${prompt}
  11442: |-
    You have the gratitude of our entire nation.
    I shall go and speak to my father.${prompt}
  11443: Additionally, I shall speak to everyone involved with this incident to see if we are missing anything.${prompt}
  11444: Until we meet again!
  11445: |-
    You must help us! This matter concerns you too!
    We can't let ourselves go blindly into war!${prompt}
  11446: |-
    If the Senate decides to go to war, there is little that can be done.
    However, I do wish to avoid any unnecessary harm to the republic.${prompt}
  11447: I wish you luck, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11448: |-
    Head to the Palborough Mines and find out whether the Quadav have obtained the “World Eater Egg” or not.
    We also need you to find out what they're up to.${prompt}
  11449: |-
    Please carry out our lady's request as quickly as you are able.
    There might not be much time remaining.${prompt}
  11450: |-
    Ah, you're back at last.
    The good lady has eagerly awaited your return.${prompt}
  11451: I most definitely have!
  11452: |-
    You must tell us about the Quadav at once!
    Before it's too late!${prompt}
  11453: I knew it! The Quadav that appeared at the Zeruhn Mines weren't part of some assassination squad!${prompt}
  11454: So just as we thought, they were chasing after the Destiny Destroyers, yes?${prompt}
  11455: When they broke open the “World Eater Egg,” the Quadav's eggs were consumed...${prompt}
  11456: It's only natural that they'd be out for blood.${prompt}
  11457: Can we really be sure that the Quadav weren't after the power contained within the “World Eater Egg” for themselves?${prompt}
  11458: I think so. Besides, if they were truly planning to use its power, I think they would've used the scorpion to their advantage too.${prompt}
  11459: But the Quadav were also trying to kill the scorpion.${prompt}
  11460: That makes sense. I think we might just be able to convince the president...${prompt}
  11461: |-
    That's excellent news!
    Now we can forget about this stupid war with the Quadav!${prompt}
  11462: However, that mage who absorbed the power from the mind-warped scorpion is sure to be a problem.${prompt}
  11463: |-
    Hm!? You're talking about the Tarutaru mage Uran-Mafran!
    Is he a mage from the Federation of Windurst?${prompt}
  11464: If so, then Bastok's enemy is not the Quadav, but possibly the Federation of Windurst instead.${prompt}
  11465: It's okay... That's still just conjecture.${prompt}
  11466: Like we did with the Quadav, we just need to find out the truth of the matter.${prompt}
  11467: You're right. Now then, we need to find out more about this mage known as Uran-Mafran.${prompt}
  11468: |-
    I'll get Captain Volker up to speed on everything that's happened.
    After that, I want you and him to speak with the president...${prompt}
  11469: Understood!${prompt}
  11470: Although, before I go to speak with Volker...${prompt}
  11471: |-
    Please, take this present from me.
    I always cook whenever I'm worried about something...${prompt}
  11472: Also, there's something I must tell you.${prompt}
  11473: You have my utmost gratitude, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11474: Thanks to your help, I was able to achieve the outcome I believed to be just.${prompt}
  11475: Hey, do you remember what I told you before?${prompt}
  11476: |-
    “There is a lot more of this country that I want to learn about.
    And maybe someday I can become somebody who will represent the people and bring change to Bastok.”${prompt}
  11477: I have grown since then. Now, it isn't just this country that I wish to know more about, but the world itself.${prompt}
  11478: |-
    And once I do, I want to help the people of this country even more.
    I think I can help my father as well.${prompt}
  11479: |-
    I feel as if all this has enabled me to take a first step on that path.
    That is my duty as the President's daughter...${prompt}
  11480: |-
    At any rate, I first need to convince my father of the cause.
    Don't worry though, I've got it handled.${prompt}
  11481: Furthermore, I think I understand what my father means when he says the following...${prompt}
  11482: |-
    “I won't let anyone stand in my way.”
    He doesn't like people who don't back up their words with action.${prompt}
  11483: |-
    Therefore, I need to show him, not just tell him.
    That is my duty as my father's daughter.${prompt}
  11484: |-
    One day, I'll make him see it for himself...
    He'll see that trusting his daughter is the right thing to do.${prompt}
  11485: |-
    At any rate, I first need to convince my father of the cause.
    Don't worry though, I've got it handled.${prompt}
  11486: |-
    Lady Cornelia left this with me.
    Here, it's yours.${prompt}
  11487: |-
    I asked Ayame to look into the mage known as Uran-Mafran.
    She has connections in Norg, so she's perfect for the task.${prompt}
  11488: |-
    As for the president, that's up to the good captain and Lady Cornelia...
    I think it should turn out okay.${prompt}
  11489: |-
    Although, there are still many unanswered questions about this “World Eater Egg.”
    I'm not sure how the Mithril Mousquetaires should respond.${prompt}
  11490: Thanks to you, we have received valuable information from the Palborough Mines.${prompt}
  11491: |-
    I have asked plenty of questions, but there is still much I do not understand.
    In times like these, it is important to proceed with caution.${prompt}
  11492: |-
    Hey, did you hear the news?
    Ayame has been given an important mission from Sir Iron Eater.${prompt}
  11493: |-
    Yet I get stuck here tending to the wounded.
    I know it's important work too, but...${prompt}
