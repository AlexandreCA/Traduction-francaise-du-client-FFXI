  7145: Alors ne me donne pas de leçons sur ce que je fais avec eux.${prompt}
  7146: Allez, on y va.${prompt}
  7147: Kweh !${prompt}
  7148: Lâche-le, monsieur ! Tu le fais peur !${prompt}
  7149: Ouais ? Eh bien, c'est parce que tu l'as pourri !${prompt}
  7150: Je reviendrai chercher ce qui est à moi. Souviens-toi de mes mots !${prompt}
  7151: Ce genre de racaille, c'est le pire !${prompt}
  7152: Ah, bon. Ce n'est pas vraiment ton problème.${prompt}
  7153: Alors écoute, gamin... T'as du talent. Ce petit oiseau est presque à toi. Continue comme ça, d'accord ?${prompt}
  7154: Ah, ce brute ne me fait pas peur. De toute façon... regarde-toi ! Le maître a dit que tu avais du talent ! Je suis tellement jaloux.${prompt}
  7155: 'T’as ce qu’il faut, gamin. Alors je suis sûr qu’il va finir par t’apprécier. Continue comme ça et tu auras ton ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} en un rien de temps.${prompt}'
  7156: On dirait qu'il est habitué à toi. Il n'a plus du tout peur maintenant.${prompt}
  7157: |-
    Kweh !
    (Il semble être à l'aise avec toi.)${prompt}
  7158: Encore un petit peu ! Grâce à toi, il mange plus, et ses plumes ont une brillance plus saine !${prompt}
  7159: |-
    Kweh !
    (Il mange joyeusement.)${prompt}
  7160: Hah ! Je ne l'ai jamais entendu couiner aussi joyeusement !${prompt}
  7161: 'Oh, désolé. Il ne mangera pas ${item-plural: 6[2]}. Mais il pourrait aimer ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} .${prompt}'
  7162: 'Je suis désolé. À part l’heure du repas, le maître nous gronde quand on leur donne ${item-plural: 6[2]}. Je sais... C’est l’intention qui compte.${prompt}'
  7163: Eh bien, on dirait qu'il est habitué à toi maintenant !${prompt}
  7164: Bien joué ! Maintenant tu es un cavalier de chocobo qualifié.${prompt}
  7165: Maintenant que tu peux lire dans les pensées des animaux, peut-être que tu peux devenir un maître des bêtes. Bien sûr, je ne peux pas t'apprendre comment... Tu devras t'entraîner.${prompt}
  7166: Le reste dépend de toi, gamin. Pour l'instant, prends ça aux écuries.${prompt}
  7167: Le reste dépend de toi, gamin. Pour l'instant, prends ça aux écuries.${prompt}
  7168: Le maître était vraiment profond en parlant de lire leurs pensées... Au moins, on sait que le dernier propriétaire n'avait pas ce don !${prompt}
  7169: Le maître était vraiment profond en parlant de lire leurs pensées... Au moins, on sait que le dernier propriétaire n'avait pas ce don !${prompt}
  7170: Si tu peux lire dans leurs pensées, tu as peut-être ce qu'il faut pour être un maître des bêtes. Mais aucun enseignement ne pourra t'aider là-dessus... Non, non !${prompt}
  7171: En y réfléchissant, je me demande ce qu'est devenu ce lâche d'éleveur de chocobos ?${prompt}
  7172: Oh, tu n'as pas entendu ? Il est resté chez lui pour s'occuper de son fils depuis qu'il est tombé malade.${prompt}
  7173: Eh bien, c'est ce qu'il mérite pour avoir maltraité ses chocobos. Bien fait pour lui !${prompt}
  7174: De quoi tu parles ? Il était incontrôlable, mais son pauvre petit garçon n'a jamais fait de mal à personne !${prompt}
  7175: Ouais. Tu as raison. J'ai entendu dire que son gamin était choqué par ce que faisait son père, aussi.${prompt}
  7176: Peut-être que si ce brute était plus doux avec ses chocobos, son fils irait mieux. Qu'en penses-tu ?${prompt}
  7177: Eh bien, regarde de qui tu parles. Je ne pense même pas que ce soit possible... Ça me fait de la peine pour le gamin, par contre.${prompt}
  7178: Kweh !${prompt}
  7179: Aw, qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?${prompt}
  7180: C'était un piaillement triste. Pourquoi es-tu si déprimé tout d'un coup ?${prompt}
  7181: Ha-ha ! Il est tellement docile maintenant.${prompt}
  7182: J'aimerais le voir partir, mais peut-être que l'envoyer ailleurs serait ce qu'il y a de mieux pour lui.${prompt}
  7183: Il s'est juste levé et a couru. On était tellement inquiets. Il est revenu tout couvert de boue. Mais je me demande où il est allé ?${prompt}
  7184: Eh bien, salut ! Comment ça va, hein ? Tu as l'air en pleine forme ! Alors, que puis-je...${prompt}
  7185: Maître !${prompt}
  7186: 'Hé, tu penses que tu es... ${wait-animation: 2}${prompt}'
  7187: Regarde, il a peur de toi !${prompt}
  7188: Attends... Il est content de quelque chose. Qu'est-ce que cela pourrait signifier ?${prompt}
  7189: Te voilà... Merci ! C'est grâce à toi que mon fils a récupéré.${prompt}
  7190: Je t'ai battu et fouetté pendant si longtemps. Pourquoi as-tu décidé de m'aider ?${prompt}
  7191: Tu me comprends ? Non, je ne te remercierai jamais assez pour tout ce que tu as fait pour moi. Je te remercie sincèrement.${prompt}
  7192: Et toi aussi ! Merci.${prompt} 
  7193: Je ne suis plus maître des bêtes. Mais je parie que tu peux devenir un grand maître des bêtes si tu continues ainsi.${prompt}
  7194: Et je suis désolé d'avoir dit ces choses-là avant.${prompt}
  7195: Hé, ne t'en fais pas.${prompt}
  7196: Je ne suis plus digne des chocobos. S'il te plaît, prends soin de lui pour moi.${prompt}
  7197: Tu peux compter sur moi. Il va grandir fort et en bonne santé.${prompt}
  7198: Reste là.${prompt}
  7199: Marque bien mes mots. Un jour, il reviendra chercher son chocobo.${prompt}
  7200: Et le chocobo ira volontiers avec lui. Après tout, c'est un maître des bêtes.${prompt}
  7201: Tout est bien qui finit bien, non ? Maintenant tu peux te dire maître des bêtes. Tiens-toi droit, gamin !${prompt}
  7202: Tu peux maintenant devenir un maître des bêtes.${prompt}
  7203: Ah, mec ! Moi aussi, je veux devenir maître des bêtes un jour !${prompt}
  7204: Quoi ? Oh, le gamin de ce gars s'est amélioré ? Eh bien, c'est une bonne nouvelle. J'aimerais bien l'inviter chez moi un jour.${prompt}
  7205: On dirait que personne n'est à la maison.${prompt}
  7206: Salut, Galmut !${prompt}
  7207: Hé, Collet ! Reste là. J'ai presque fini !${prompt}
  7208: D'accord !${prompt}
  7209: L'horloge est toujours précise, grâce à Galmut. Il huile les engrenages chaque jour.${prompt}
  7210: Ouf... Alors, comment ça va ? Tu vas toujours à l'école, non ?${prompt}
  7211: Euh, ouais... Plus ou moins.${prompt}
  7212: Plus ou moins ? Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ? Ça me semble que tu fais l'école buissonnière !${prompt}
  7213: Ouais... Mais ta voix me fait toujours sourire.${prompt}
  7214: C'est vrai ? Eh bien, l'enfance ce n'est pas que des études. N'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7215: ★★★★★★La cloche sonne★★★★★★${prompt}
  7216: Elle est pile à l'heure ! Heh, c'est moi qui m'occupe de cette horloge.${prompt}
  7217: Au début, c'était un travail ennuyeux, mais maintenant je vois à quel point c'est vraiment amusant.${prompt}
  7218: Cette horloge nécessite beaucoup d'attention, sinon elle sonne immédiatement. C'est une créature si délicate.${prompt}
  7219: Chaque fois que je l'entends sonner, j'ai l'impression d'avoir réveillé cette ville.${prompt}
  7220: Chaque jour, je vois les mêmes gens passer pendant que je nettoie les engrenages, et ils s'arrêtent pour dire bonjour.${prompt}
  7221: Parfois, quand je n'en vois pas un, je commence à m'inquiéter s'ils vont bien.${prompt}
  7222: J'avais un œil sur une certaine fille...${prompt}
  7223: Jusqu'au jour où je l'ai vue avec un autre gars. Man, ça m'a fait mal.${prompt}
  7224: Enfin, peu importe... Plus je travaillais, plus j'avais l'impression d'aider tout le monde. Ça me rendait heureux.${prompt}
  7225: Je m'amuse trop, non ?${prompt}
  7226: Ouais, beaucoup trop !${prompt}
  7227: Hé, je ne te posais pas la question.${prompt}
  7228: Eh bien, je ferais bien de rentrer bientôt. Prends soin de toi !${prompt}
  7229: Ravi de t'avoir rencontré. À demain !${prompt}
  7230: Galmut travaille sur l'horloge. Ne le dérange pas.${prompt}
  7231: J'ai trop peur de l'école. J'ai dit à Galmut que je pensais que tout le monde me détestait. Mais il a dit que ce n'était pas possible.${prompt}
  7232: Oh, c'est toi... Désolé, mais je suis en plein milieu de quelque chose. Pourrais-tu revenir plus tard ?${prompt}
  7233: Eh bien, regarde qui voilà ! Bienvenue dans mon humble demeure.${prompt}
  7234: J'ai plein de trucs bizarres, non ?${prompt}
  7235: Heh. Ce sont peut-être des déchets, mais ce sont toutes des choses précieuses qu'une certaine personne m'a données.${prompt}
  7236: Hé, qu'est-ce que tu fais ? C'est mon lit !${prompt}
  7237: Y a-t-il quelqu'un à la maison ?${prompt}
  7238: Eh bien, parle du loup... C'est M. Narihira !${prompt}
  7239: Je vois que tu tiens toujours le coup.${prompt}
  7240: Hah ! Vous les jeunes d'après-guerre, vous n'avez rien sur ma génération !${prompt}
  7241: Eh bien, c'est bon de te voir.${prompt}
  7242: Comment va l'horloge, Galmut ?${prompt}
  7243: Je m'en occupe bien. Ne me dis pas que tu ne l'entends pas sonner !${prompt}
  7244: Hein ? Qu'est-ce que tu as dit ? Je rigole. Bien sûr que je l'entends très bien !${prompt}
  7245: Mais j'entends les engrenages qui ont du mal. Peut-être qu'il est temps de lui mettre un peu d'huile.${prompt}
  7246: Eh bien, tu n'as pas changé d'un pouce !${prompt}
  7247: Et je vois que tu as un ami ici !${prompt}
  7248: Écoute, gamin. Galmut est un citoyen modèle maintenant, mais avant, c'était un vrai voyou !${prompt} 
  7249: Oh non, pas encore ça !${prompt}
  7250: Ohohoho ! Défensif, hein ? Quoi qu'il en soit, Galmut est arrivé à Jeuno il y a environ trois ans...${prompt}
  7251: Il est venu dans la grande ville pour marquer son territoire. Il a travaillé tous les jours du matin au soir !${prompt}
  7252: Et quand j'ai enfin eu assez de fric pour ouvrir mon propre magasin...${prompt}
  7253: Je me suis fait arnaquer. J'ai tout perdu...${prompt}
  7254: Et ça l'a vraiment secoué ! Il a perdu foi en l'humanité... en grognant sur tout le monde comme un chien affamé.${prompt}
  7255: C'est à ce moment-là que M. Narihira m'a proposé un emploi à la tour de l'horloge.${prompt}
  7256: Au début, je pensais que c'était juste un autre arnaqueur. Mais une fois que j'ai commencé, j'ai vraiment apprécié.${prompt}
  7257: Tu sais, on travaille tellement dur là-dedans que, quand on entend enfin la cloche sonner... Mec, ça résonne jusqu'au cœur !${prompt}
  7258: Et j'étais content de trouver quelqu'un qui continuerait à ma place.${prompt}
  7259: Oh ouais... J'avais presque oublié !${prompt}
  7260: 'Il nous faut ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}. Et avec les bêtes en furie, le magasin est presque à sec.${prompt}'
  7261: Non mais vraiment ? Sans huile, nous...${prompt}
  7262: Peut-être que le Tenshodo en a encore. Mais je déteste faire des affaires avec eux.${prompt}
  7263: 'Moi aussi... Hé, je sais ! Tu voudrais bien nous apporter ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} ?${prompt}'
  7264: Nous te serions tellement reconnaissants. C'est une machine si délicate... Sans ça, j'ai peur qu'elle ne parte en vrille !${prompt}
  7265: |-
    Les aideras-tu ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Pas maintenant.${prompt}
  7266: D'accord ! Merci beaucoup !${prompt}
  7267: D'abord, va au Tenshodo, ici à Jeuno.${prompt}
  7268: Oh, vraiment ? Eh bien, dis-moi si tu changes d'avis. On doit faire quelque chose.${prompt}
  7269: 'Oh, c''est toi. On n''a toujours pas trouvé ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  7270: M. Narihira a dit que le Tenshodo en a. Sans ça, tôt ou tard les engrenages vont s'arrêter !${prompt}
  7271: Qui est là !?${prompt}
  7272: Oh, toi... Merci d'avoir apporté l'huile, mais on n'en a plus besoin !${prompt}
  7273: J'ai entendu dire qu'ils allaient la démolir pour en faire une grue pour soulever des cargaisons des navires.${prompt}
  7274: Le plan est déjà passé. Y'a plus rien à faire maintenant !${prompt}
  7275: 'Eh bien, je vais prendre ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. Merci d’avoir essayé, ${choice-player-gender}[pote/ami]. C''est pour toi.${prompt}'
  7276: J'essaie de croire en quelque chose, et voilà ce qui arrive !${prompt}
  7277: Galmut, c'est moi ! T'es là ?${prompt}
  7278: Oh, c'est toi. Où est Galmut ?${prompt}
  7279: Il est sorti, hein ? Et il a entendu parler de l'horloge ? Il a dû être choqué.${prompt}
  7280: 'C''est Galmut, ça. Regarde, si on récolte suffisamment de signatures avec ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, on pourrait peut-être arrêter le plan !${prompt}'
  7281: 'Ils vont démonter l’horloge. Narihira a dit qu’on pouvait obtenir ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} à la Chambre de Commerce et d’Industrie, mais je ne sais pas ce qu’il veut dire.${prompt}'
  7282: Galmut était tellement choqué. Mais je peux rien faire. C'est lui qui me remonte toujours le moral.${prompt}
  7283: Galmut ne sortira pas, peu importe combien je l'appelle. Je me demande ce qu'il a...${prompt}
  7284: Mais l'horloge semble fonctionner correctement. Je me demande qui la maintient en marche... C'est l'une des sept merveilles de Jeuno !${prompt}
  7285: Hein ? Tu veux que je signe ? Si ça aide Galmut, bien sûr !${prompt}
  7286: Qu'est-ce que c'est ?${prompt}
  7287: Quoi !? Tu...${prompt}
  7288: J'ai entendu dire que quelqu'un avait lancé une pétition. Mais c'était toi ? Galmut devrait être heureux d'avoir un ami comme toi.${prompt}
  7289: Je me demande où il a bien pu aller. C'est pathétique !${prompt}
  7290: 'Tout le monde est contre moi ! C''est fini !${wait-animation: 3}${prompt}'
  7291: M. Narihira... Et toi... Que fais-tu ici ?${prompt}
  7292: Tais-toi et écoute pour une fois ! Ton ami a réuni tellement de signatures que la pétition pour sauver la tour de l'horloge a réussi !${prompt}
  7293: Hein ? Pétition ? Ça veut dire que les engrenages vont continuer à tourner ?${prompt}
  7294: Bien sûr, idiot ! En ce moment, c'est toi qui es l'horloge arrêtée.${prompt}
  7295: Tu sais ce que ça veut dire, n'est-ce pas ? Plus de sonneries retentissantes. Tu me suis, gamin ?${prompt}
  7296: M. Narihira... Je suis désolé.${prompt}
  7297: Enfer, je me fiche de ce que tu ressens !${prompt}
  7298: Tu dois faire face à toutes les personnes qui comptent sur cette horloge ! Sans les cloches chaque jour...${prompt}
  7299: 'Ugh...${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  7300: M. Narihira !${prompt}
  7301: Oh, je vais bien. J'ai juste gardé l'horloge en marche pendant ton absence. Et, mon dieu, j'étais plus rouillé qu'elle !${prompt}
  7302: Je ne sais pas comment te remercier. Personne ne s'est jamais soucié de me parler franchement.${prompt}
  7303: Ah ! Quel genre d'idiot aime se faire engueuler !?${prompt}
  7304: En plus, je pense qu'il y a quelqu'un d'autre que tu devrais remercier. Ton horloge précieuse serait à la ferraille sans ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle].${prompt} 
  7305: Je ne sais pas quoi dire... Ni comment te remercier... Ce n'est pas grand-chose, mais ça signifie beaucoup pour moi. S'il te plaît, je veux que tu l'aies.${prompt}
  7306: Je te suis tellement reconnaissant. Je veillerai à ce que rien n'arrive à cette horloge, car c'est ce qui unit tout le monde.${prompt}
  7307: Je te crois, Galmut.${prompt}
  7308: Eh bien, tu as du travail devant toi. Va-y, gamin !${prompt}
  7309: Salut, Galmut !${prompt}
  7310: Hé, Collet ! Je dois rester et finir... Et c'est ${name-player} à côté de toi ? Grâce à toi, je sais à quel point je suis heureux !${prompt}
  7311: Galmut est de retour dans le bain. Et je me sens mieux aussi ! Hmm, je pense que je vais retourner à l'école.${prompt}
  7312: Oh, c'est toi, hein ? Galmut travaille plus dur que jamais, grâce à toi. Fais-moi une faveur et viens prendre de ses nouvelles de temps en temps, d'accord ?${prompt}
  7313: Hmm, peut-être que je pourrais demander à ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle]... Oh, ce n'est rien ! Laisse tomber.${prompt}
  7314: Dis, tu vas à Davoi ?${prompt}
  7315: 'Alors tu auras besoin de ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. Tu ne peux pas briser le sceau intérieur sans ça.${prompt}'

    Vas-tu m'apporter ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} ?

    Je le ferai pour le blason.
    Pas tout de suite.${prompt}
  7318: D'accord ! Merci ! Tu peux trouver des coeurls dans la Sauromugue Champaign.${prompt}
  7319: Oh, mince ! Eh bien, reviens si tu changes d'avis.${prompt}

  7329: Ahahaha... Quelle viande délicieuse. La graisse, si parfaitement marbrée !${prompt}
  7330: Aumfch... Mmmm ! Ahh... De la viande fraîche !${prompt}
  7331: Ma sœur était tellement gentille avant de tomber malade. Elle avait tellement hâte d'épouser Albrecht.${prompt}
  7332: Mais un jour, après être revenue d'un pique-nique avec Alista, elle a eu mal à la tête et est restée au lit. Puis, elle est devenue comme ça.${prompt} 
  7333: Tout le monde dit qu'elle est sous une sorte de malédiction. Albrecht prie au temple chaque jour, espérant un soulagement.${prompt}
  7334: J'ai entendu dire que le blason enlèverait la malédiction, mais ça n'a pas marché non plus.${prompt}
  7335: Mais je ne pense pas qu'elle soit maudite du tout ! Elle n'a jamais rien fait de mal pour être maudite ainsi !${prompt}

  7339: Eh bien ? Des nouvelles ?${prompt}
  7340: |-
    As-tu appris quelque chose sur sa maladie ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Non, rien.
    En fait...${prompt}
  7341: Vraiment ? Eh bien, merci d'avoir essayé.${prompt}
  7342: Ne te donne pas cette peine. Je sais que tu essaies juste de me remonter le moral.${prompt}
  7343: Hé, Baudin. Comment va-t-elle ?${prompt}
  7344: Elle est toujours la même, Albrecht.${prompt}
  7345: Vraiment... Eh bien, ce n'est qu'une question de temps, puisque je prie pour elle chaque jour.${prompt}
  7346: Pas question ! Elle ne va pas aller mieux !${prompt}
  7347: Baudin, qu'est-ce que tu dis ?${prompt}
  7348: Elle n'a jamais rien fait de mal ! Ça ne peut pas être une malédiction. Tu peux prier autant que tu veux, mais elle ne guérira pas !${prompt}
  7349: Qu'est-ce qui te prend ? Je reviendrai plus tard. Essaie de te calmer et de reprendre tes esprits avant mon retour.${prompt}
  7350: Baudin, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ? Tu étais tellement perdu dans tes pensées que tu ne m'as même pas vu, pas vrai ?${prompt}
  7351: Non, ce n'est rien.${prompt}
  7352: D'accord, très bien alors. Alors, comment va-t-elle ?${prompt}

    Si seulement je savais quoi faire...
    Si jamais tu trouves un remède pour ma sœur, fais-le-moi savoir.${prompt}

  7367: J-Je suis tellement désolé. Je savais comment guérir sa maladie.${prompt}
  7368: Q-Quoi !? Que se passe-t-il ?${prompt}
  7369: Quand nous sommes sortis ce jour-là, j’ai vu un fantôme venir la posséder. Je savais que nous devions l’exorciser...${prompt}
  7370: Je suis tellement désolé. Je ne voulais pas perdre mon frère à cause d’elle.${prompt}

  7374: Je...${prompt}
  7375: Baudin, je veux que tu nous pardonnes tous les deux. Je savais qu’Alista détestait Audia, mais je ne soupçonnais rien.${prompt}
  7376: Même si tu ne nous pardonnes pas, s’il te plaît, donne-lui ceci maintenant !${prompt}
  7377: Qu’est-ce que c’est ? Et comment...?${prompt}

  7379: Albrecht, Alista... C’est bon. Je vous crois.${prompt}
  7380: Audia, Albrecht a bravé les dangers pour trouver un remède pour toi. Maintenant, je veux que tu fasses un effort et que tu guérisses !${prompt}

  7391: Quoi ?${prompt}
  7392: Tu viendras vivre avec nous, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}

  7394: Bien sûr ! Je pense comprendre ce que tu ressens.${prompt}
  7395: Je suis tellement désolé, Audia. Je n’aurais jamais dû laisser cela t’arriver.${prompt}
  7396: Baudin...${prompt}
  7397: Et toi, étranger. Je te remercie.${prompt}
  7398: J’ai simplement refusé d’affronter la réalité. J’ai honte...${prompt} 
  7399: J’ai oublié que nous devons d’abord faire ce que nous sommes capables de faire, avant de demander l’aide divine.${prompt}
  7400: Il y a des moments où nous devons agir, même face à l’adversité.${prompt}
  7401: Par la prière, nous gagnons la force et l’espoir de continuer. Mais ensuite, il faut agir !${prompt}
  7402: Ceci est pour toi. Pour avoir essayé d’aider Audia, et pour m’avoir fait réaliser la vérité. Utilise-le bien !${prompt}
  7403: Baudin, laisse-moi m’occuper d’Audia maintenant. Je ne laisserai jamais une telle chose lui arriver à nouveau. Je le promets !${prompt}
  7404: S’il te plaît, Baudin. Je t’en supplie !${prompt}
  7405: Non, ce n’est rien ! Je sais que tu peux bien t’occuper d’elle.${prompt}
  7406: Merci, Baudin.${prompt}
  7407: Audia...${prompt}
  7408: Oh, Albrecht...${prompt}
  7409: On dirait qu’elle va bien maintenant. Merci de nous avoir aidés. Cela faisait une éternité que je ne l’avais pas vue sourire.${prompt}
  7410: Quoi ? La tour de l’horloge !? Galmut m’a une fois montré l’intérieur. C’était sombre, sale et ça sentait l’huile, mais Galmut la connaissait de fond en comble.${prompt}
  7411: 'Bien sûr que je signerai ! Aussi, voici un secret : Galmut avait un faible pour ma sœur !${prompt}'
  7412: Oh, bonjour. Vous ne trouverez rien ici sauf des souvenirs d’un autre temps. Les jeunes gens pleins de vie comme vous mourraient probablement d’ennui !${prompt}
  7413: Bonjour. Je viens toujours aider Ilumida. Elle a des problèmes de dos et ne peut vraiment plus vivre seule.${prompt}
  7414: La guerre est peut-être terminée, mais la douleur est éternelle. Ilumida a perdu son mari, et des gens comme elle souffrent chaque jour.${prompt}
  7415: Jeuno semble être un endroit animé, mais regardez de plus près et vous trouverez des cicatrices persistantes. La guerre est vraiment une chose terrible.${prompt}
  7416: Oh, un visiteur ? Que puis-je faire pour vous ?${prompt}
  7417: Je cherche Ilumida. Est-elle ici ?${prompt}
  7418: Je me demande qui cela pourrait être. Excusez-moi, s’il vous plaît.${prompt}
  7419: Pourquoi, c’est Wolfgang ! Entrez, entrez.${prompt}
  7420: Je suis content de voir que vous allez bien. Tenez, laissez-moi vous donner le paiement de ce mois-ci.${prompt}
  7421: Merci, comme toujours, Wolfgang. Vous savez à quel point je vous suis reconnaissante.${prompt}
  7422: Non, c’est ce que mon père voulait.${prompt}
  7423: Je l’apprécie vraiment, cependant. Que diriez-vous d’un verre ? J’ai du bon thé aujourd’hui.${prompt}
  7424: Merci, Ilumida, mais je dois y aller. Peut-être que plus tard, j’aurai le temps de vous rendre visite.${prompt}
  7425: Oh ? C’est dommage. Eh bien, prenez soin de vous, Wolfgang !${prompt}
  7426: Toujours à votre service, madame.${prompt}
  7427: Le père de Wolfgang, Brandolf, était aussi un soldat. Il s’est battu pour la liberté de Jeuno bien avant le règne de l’archiduc.${prompt}
  7428: Et mon mari a servi sous ses ordres. Mais dans les guerres qui ont suivi... Quand il avait à peu près l’âge de Wolfgang...${prompt}
  7429: Son père, Brandolf, est mort des blessures qu’il a reçues au combat. Avant de mourir, il a ordonné que des fonds soient versés à des gens comme moi.${prompt}
  7430: Eh bien, qui suis-je pour donner une leçon à un étranger ? Je suis désolée.${prompt}
  7431: Bon, je suppose que je dois maintenant aller donner l’information.${prompt}
  7432: Je pensais qu’il y avait une bougie ici...${prompt}
  7433: Oh, mon dieu... Il semble que je n’ai plus de bougies !${prompt}
  7434: Pourriez-vous aller au temple et en chercher une pour moi ? À mon âge, même de courtes marches me laissent complètement essoufflée.${prompt}

  7438: Je pense que le Temple de la Déesse devrait avoir des bougies. Je sais que c’est embêtant, mais pourriez-vous aller en chercher une ?${prompt}
  7439: Oh, splendide. Maintenant je peux le dire à mon mari. Et pour vous, voici un petit quelque chose pour votre peine.${prompt}
  7440: Ce n’est pas grand-chose, mais je crois que cela veillera sur vous en cas de besoin. Allez, ne soyez pas timide... Prenez-le !${prompt}
  7441: Cela fait si longtemps que mon mari est mort à la guerre. Cette maison était petite pour nous deux, et elle semble toujours si grande rien qu’avec moi.${prompt}
  7442: Eh bien, n’hésitez pas à passer si vous êtes dans le quartier. J’ai toujours une théière prête pour recevoir des invités.${prompt}
  7443: Et merci beaucoup. Mon mari doit être très content. Ne soyez pas un étranger, d’accord ?${prompt}
  7444: Ha ! Vous perdez votre temps !${prompt}
  7445: J’aide Verena et Fickie à faire pousser des fleurs. On les arrose tous les jours. J’espère vraiment qu’elles fleuriront bientôt !${prompt}
  7446: Ouais, c’est ça. Jamais les graines des hommes-bêtes ne pousseront.${prompt}
  7447: Nan ! Elles pousseront !${prompt}
  7448: Ouais ! Mon papa a dit que les hommes-bêtes allaient déclencher une nouvelle guerre ! Fickie est l’ennemi !${prompt}
  7449: Nan ! Fickie est notre ami !${prompt}
  7450: Fickie nous a dit que quand elles fleuriront, cela voudra dire que les gens et les "bébêtes" peuvent être amis. J’ai été surpris d’entendre ça, surtout venant d’un gobbie-wobbie !${prompt}
  7451: Je sais qu’elles fleuriront. Je vais y arriver.${prompt}
  7452: Juste pour te montrer qu’elles vont se faner et mourir.${prompt}
  7453: Salut, Fickie ! Salut, Verena !${prompt}
  7454: Alors, toujours pas de pousse, hein ?${prompt}
  7455: Oui, je sais, c’est vraiment décevant. Pourtant, je les arrose tous les jours !${prompt}
  7456: Elles ne pousseront jamais.${prompt}
  7457: Arrose-les autant que tu veux. Les graines de Fickie ne pousseront jamais ici, à Jeuno. Jamais !${prompt}
  7458: Regarde, pourquoi tu ne te tais pas ! On ne sait jamais tant qu’on n’a pas essayé.${prompt}
  7459: Oh ! T’es toujours du côté de Fickie, pas vrai ?${prompt}
  7460: Je pense qu’elles vont pousser.${prompt}
  7461: Hein ?${prompt}
  7462: Tout le monde me parle maintenant que je les ai plantées. Ça me rend si heureux.${prompt}
  7463: Alors, même si les fleurs ne fleurissent jamais, c’était quand même bien.${prompt}
  7464: Fickie...${prompt}
  7465: Peu importe !${prompt}
  7466: Je dois retourner chez Muck. Je vous vois demain.${prompt}
  7467: Prends soin de toi, Fickblix. Moi aussi, je rentre à la maison.${prompt}
  7468: J’espère qu’elles pousseront demain ! Bye !${prompt}
  7469: Merci pour tout.${prompt}
  7470: Et merci d’avoir apporté l’engrais, Geebeh.${prompt}
  7471: Peu importe ! Ce n’est pas pour toi que je le fais.${prompt}
  7472: Depuis que Fickie est parti, je ne vois plus Verena dans le coin. Même les gars du Tenshodo ne me parlent plus.${prompt}
  7473: C’est un lâche ! Il s’est enfui avant que les fleurs n’aient eu le temps de fleurir ! Ce n’est pas juste !${prompt}
  7474: Je te dis de pousser ! Vous êtes nos fleurs ! À nous et à Fickie ! Alors poussez, nom d’un chien !${prompt}
  7475: Attends, Geebeh. Regarde-moi ça !${prompt}
  7476: Oh, quoi encore ? C’est... une pousse ? Ça pousse ?${prompt}
  7477: Exactement, Geebeh ! On ne peut pas le voir juste en regardant, mais ça commence à pousser sous la terre !${prompt}
  7478: On a planté ces graines ! Nous et Fickie ! Et maintenant elles poussent !${prompt}
  7479: Donne ça à Verena. Dis-lui que les fleurs que nous avons plantées avec Fickie commencent à pousser !${prompt}
  7480: Je suis sûr qu’elles vont devenir magnifiques !${prompt}

  7732: Oh, oui... J’ai entendu quelque chose d’étrange pendant ton absence... Quelque chose à propos du fantôme d’un Opo-opo au château d’Oztroja.${prompt}
  7733: On dit qu’il n’attaque pas, donc peut-être qu’il était domestiqué avant sa mort. En tant que maître des bêtes, tu veux en savoir plus, non ?${prompt}

    Les régions sous contrôle des hommes-bêtes.${prompt}
  7765: Les trois nations s'efforcent chaque jour de mettre plus de régions sous leur contrôle. C'est ce que nous appelons les « conquêtes ». Vous pouvez y participer et servir votre pays en éliminant des ennemis tant que le Signe est lancé sur vous.${prompt}
  7766: Chaque région est composée de plusieurs zones, et la nation qui élimine le plus de monstres dans ces zones prend le contrôle de la région.${prompt}
  7767: Les nations reçoivent des biens et des ressources des régions sous leur contrôle.${prompt}
  7768: Ainsi, plus de régions nous contrôlons, plus notre nation devient riche.${prompt}

    Des gardes-frontières sont également placés dans les avant-postes des régions sous notre contrôle.

  7770: Une fois que vous avez le Signe de votre nation, vous pourrez acquérir des cristaux en éliminant les ennemis que vous vainquez.${prompt}
  7771: Non seulement cela, mais vous recevrez aussi des points de conquête. Vous obtenez plus de points de conquête si vous éliminez des ennemis dans des régions qui ne sont pas sous le contrôle de votre nation. Ces points peuvent être utilisés pour acheter des objets auprès des gardes comme moi.${prompt}
  7772: |-
    Vous voyez... les conquêtes bénéficient autant aux nations qu'aux aventuriers.
    Nous attendons de vous que vous fassiez de votre mieux pour servir votre pays.${prompt}

    Vous pouvez voir l'état actuel des conquêtes en sélectionnant « Infos sur les régions » dans le menu principal.
    Les résultats de conquête dans toutes les régions sont régulièrement recalculés, donc vous voudrez peut-être les vérifier de temps en temps.${prompt}

  7782: Lorsque les résultats des conquêtes sont annoncés, on vous indiquera quel pays contrôle la région dans laquelle vous vous trouvez à ce moment-là. Parfois, les régions peuvent devenir neutres, ou les hommes-bêtes peuvent même prendre le contrôle des régions.${prompt}
  7783: Si nous prenons le contrôle d'une région, des gardes-frontières seront placés dans ses avant-postes pour aider les aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
  7784: Des marchands seront également placés là, et les biens de cette région trouveront leur chemin vers les magasins locaux ici.${prompt}
  7785: Prendre le contrôle des régions est le principe de base des conquêtes. Nous avons besoin que chacun de vous fasse de son mieux et place notre nation en tête des classements.${prompt}
  7786: Bien sûr, parfois nous perdons des régions au profit d'autres nations... nous devons donc essayer de les reprendre avant l'annonce des résultats de la prochaine conquête.${prompt}
  7787: Comme incitation, nous vous récompenserons avec plus de points de conquête pour avoir éliminé des monstres dans ces régions.${prompt}
  7788: Mais si nous sommes alliés avec une autre nation, vous ne recevrez que le taux régulier pour avoir éliminé des monstres dans les régions de nos alliés. En revanche, nous vous récompenserons avec plus de points pour combattre dans les régions de la nation classée première.${prompt}

    Notre principale préoccupation est que les hommes-bêtes prennent le contrôle de nos régions.
    Si trop d'entre nous sont vaincus dans une région, les hommes-bêtes prendront le contrôle de celle-ci.${prompt}
  7790: Si cela se produit, non seulement ce sera un grand coup porté à notre fierté, mais vous ne pourrez également pas acquérir de cristaux dans cette région.${prompt}
  7791: Les hommes-bêtes sont une menace pour toutes les nations. S'ils prennent le pouvoir, nous devons tous nous unir et chasser ces créatures viles de cette région.${prompt}
  7792: Nous avons besoin que vous apportiez des fournitures aux gardes-frontières des avant-postes qui sont placés dans les régions sous notre contrôle.${prompt}

    Pour seulement ${number: 6} gil, je rappellerai ton passé.
    Mais je trouve que tu manques d'argent ou de renommée,
    Alors jusqu'à ce moment-là, mon offre bienveillante durera.${prompt}
  8094: Maintenant ferme les yeux...${prompt}
  8095: Bonjour, jeune aventurier. Voudrais-tu prendre une tasse de thé avec une vieille femme ? J'apprécierais un peu de compagnie.${prompt}
  8096: Tu vois ce petit coffre ? Il m'a été donné par mon défunt mari, que la Déesse bénisse son âme.${prompt}
  8097: Mais regarde-le. Il est assez vieux, la fabrication n'est pas vraiment remarquable, et en plus, il est verrouillé. Ce n'est pas le genre de cadeau qu'on offrirait à un être cher, hein ? Heh heh heh...${prompt}
  8098: C'est le seul cadeau que j'ai jamais reçu de mon mari. Je me souviens encore du jour où il me l'a donné... “Tiens.” C'est tout ce qu'il a dit... Il n'a jamais été doué avec les mots.${prompt}
  8099: Mais je garde ce coffre précieusement... Tu dois penser que je suis folle de m'accrocher à quelque chose d'aussi inutile pendant si longtemps.${prompt}
  8100: Excusez-moi, est-ce que quelqu'un est là ?${prompt}
  8101: Oh, et qui pourrais-tu être, mon petit ami ?${prompt}
  8102: Mon nom est Kurou-Morou le Magnifiquearu. Je suis le propriétaire des services astrologiques les plus fiables et viables de tout Jeuno.${prompt}
  8103: Je suis venu ici aujourd'hui pour demander un service. Je me demandais si tu serais prêt à te séparer de ce coffre-aru.${prompt}
  8104: Quoi ?${prompt}
  8105: J'ai entendu des rumeurs de mes clients qu'un coffre étrange et vieillot est en ta possession. Je sens que le coffre que tu tiens pourrait être magique.${prompt}
  8106: Il existe une légende qui raconte qu'autrefois, un dieu timide et réservé construisit une boîte pour l'aider à exprimer ses vrais sentiments à son amour. Il remplit la boîte avec les mots qu'il ne pouvait pas dire, et l'envoya à elle.${prompt}
  8107: Tu dis que cette boîte est...${prompt}
  8108: Tu ne le savais pas ?${prompt}
  8109: 'Tu peux ouvrir ce coffre-aru en utilisant ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, qui, dit-on, tombe sur Vana''diel depuis la lune.${prompt}'
  8110: Une fois ouvert, la promesse du véritable amour sera réalisée... ou du moins, c'est ce que dit la légende.${prompt}
  8111: J'ai besoin de ce coffre-aru pour dire à Chulu... pour dire à mon amie de longue date ce que je ressens pour elle. Je veux le remplir de mes sentiments.${prompt}
  8112: Pourquoi ne pas simplement lui dire toi-même ?${prompt}
  8113: Je... je ne peux pas-aru !${prompt}
  8114: Et tu veux me dire... que tu n'as jamais ouvert le coffre-aru ?${prompt}
  8115: C'est exact. C'était un cadeau de mon mari...${prompt}
  8116: Il... il n'aurait jamais cru à de telles histoires de fées... ou peut-être... ?${prompt}
  8117: 'Eh bien, je ne peux''taru utiliser ce coffre-aru s''il est rempli de sentiments de quelqu’un d’autre... Mais si nous avions ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} de l’Arbre de Boyahda, nous pourrions l’ouvrir et...${prompt}'

    Voyager jusqu'à l'Arbre de Boyahda ?

  8122: Mais de penser que mon mari m'aurait laissé un tel cadeau...${prompt}
  8123: Eh bien, je suppose que c'était trop te demander...${prompt}

  8128: Le coffre s'est ouvert... mais rien ne s'est passé jusqu'à présent...${prompt}

    Ma chère Ilumida,
    Je ne sais pas pourquoi j'écris ceci.
    Tu sais que je n'ai jamais été doué pour
    te dire ce que je ressens.${prompt}

    Plusieurs fois j'ai essayé de mettre
    en mots mon amour pour toi, mais
    ces mots n'ont jamais 
    réussi à sortir.${prompt}

    Boire du thé ensemble lors d'un matin
    d'automne, ou se reposer à l'ombre lors d'un
    après-midi d'été... ce sont les petites
    choses qui me rendaient heureux.${prompt}
  8136: |2-
    Autant que j'aimerais tout laisser tomber
    et passer tout mon temps avec toi, la situation
    actuelle à Vana'diel 
    ne me le permet pas.${prompt}
  8137: |2-
    J'aurais aimé être à tes côtés
    lorsque tu liras cette lettre, mais cela
    n'est peut-être pas ce que le destin me réserve.
    Je dois te dire ce que je ressens maintenant.${prompt}
  8138: "  \n  Je t'aime.\n  ${prompt}"
  8139: |2-
    À ce jour, je regrette de ne jamais avoir dit
    ces mots, et je t'en prie, 
    un jour pardonne-moi.

    La date...
    Elle est datée du jour avant qu'il parte à la guerre...${prompt}
  8141: Tout ce temps, il voulait juste dire...${prompt}

    Tiens.
    Prends cette caisse.${prompt}
  8144: V-vraiment ?${prompt}
  8145: Bien sûr. Je n'en ai plus besoin. J'ai déjà reçu son véritable cadeau.${prompt}
  8146: Si tu tiens vraiment à cette fille, évite de faire des choses que tu regretteras plus tard. Les femmes ne se soucient pas de la manière dont c'est dit. Si tu veux vraiment dire ce que tu ressens, elle le saura.${prompt}
  8147: Que tu utilises cette boîte ou non, c'est à toi de décider.${prompt}
  8148: M-Merci. Mais je pense que je n'en aurai pas besoin.${prompt}
  8149: Ton histoire m'a donné le courage de dire à Chululu ce que je ressens. Merci, Madame.${prompt}
  8150: |-
    Oh, ${name-player}. Prends ceci--et un peu de gil--comme récompense. Je comptais de toute façon les utiliser pour acquérir la caisse.
    Eh bien, je file à ma boutique. Ta-taru !${prompt}
  8151: |-
    Merci encore pour toute ton aide.
    Les mots que mon mari m'a laissés résonnent encore dans mon esprit... C'est comme s'il était là, dans cette pièce, debout à mes côtés maintenant...${prompt}
  8152: Notre petit ami a pu exprimer ses sentiments à sa petite amie ? Je savais qu'il ferait ce qu'il fallait.${prompt}
  8153: J'aimerais bien m'asseoir et prendre une tasse de thé avec ce Chululu. Je suis sûre que nous aurions beaucoup de choses à discuter...${prompt}
  8154: Waouh, d'où viennent toutes ces callosités sur tes mains ?${prompt}
  8155: C'est de pratiquer avec ta hache ?${prompt}
  8156: C'est plutôt impressionnant, mais je ne pense toujours pas que tu pourrais égaler mon patron là-bas. Il a rassemblé nos chocobos et construit toute cette écurie, tout avec une seule hache.${prompt}
  8157: Pourquoi, il pourrait éliminer les monstres les plus dangereux d'un seul coup !${prompt} 
  8158: Osker ! Arrête de jacasser et retourne au travail ! Nos chocobos sont en train de mourir de faim là-bas !${prompt}
  8159: D-Désolé, patron. Je n'avais juste que l'admiration pour les mains de cet aventurier. Elles ont l'air de pouvoir manier une hache à merveille.${prompt}
  8160: Regarde. Elles sont pleines de callosités, tout comme les tiennes !${prompt}
  8161: |-
    Tu sais, tu as raison...
    ${name-player}, on dirait que tu connais bien ta hache. Si ce n'est pas trop demander, j'aimerais te demander un service.${prompt}
  8162: L'autre jour, le chef de cette équipe de Tenshodo nous a rendu une visite imprévue...${prompt}
  8163: Il a dit qu'il était intéressé par le marché de la hache, mais qu'il ne savait pas laquelle il voulait vendre dans sa boutique. Il m'a demandé de tester deux nouveaux modèles... mais j'ai assez de travail avec les écuries et je n'ai pas de temps à perdre à trancher et découper.${prompt}
  8164: Si tu n'es pas trop occupé, ça te dérangerait de les essayer ? Tu peux le voir comme un moyen de peaufiner tes compétences.${prompt}
  8165: |-
    Alors, qu'en dis-tu ?
    ${selection-lines}
    D'accord, je vais t'aider.
    Je suis désolé...${prompt}
  8166: |-
    Génial !
    Tiens, prends-la. J'ai déjà trouvé quelqu'un pour essayer l'autre.${prompt}
  8167: Sors et teste cette fille jusqu'à ce qu'elle soit aussi émoussée qu'une fille chocobo. Quand tu auras l'impression que la hache a tranché son dernier coup, rapporte-la-moi et nous continuerons à partir de là. Compris ?${prompt}
  8168: Oui, tu as l'air d'un(e) ${choice-player-gender}[homme/femme] occupé(e). On ne peut pas s'attendre à ce que quelqu'un t'aide sans rien en retour...${prompt}
  8169: Quand tu sentiras que la hache a tranché son dernier coup, montre-la-moi, et je déciderai si nous devons continuer ou non. Ou es-tu ici pour autre chose ?${prompt}
  8170: |-
    Que veux-tu ?
    ${selection-lines}
    J'ai perdu le ${item-singular: 1[2]}.
    J'en ai assez de tester la hache.
    Rien du tout.${prompt}
  8171: Quoi ? Tu as perdu ? Eh bien, le gars de Tenshodo m'a donné une boîte pleine de ces haches, alors ça m'est égal si tu les utilises pour raser les moustaches de ton chat.${prompt}
  8172: Tiens, en prends-en une autre. Mais tu sais que cela signifie que tu vas devoir tout recommencer, non ?${prompt}
  8173: Ne me dis pas que tu abandonnes ? Allez maintenant. J'ai beaucoup de travail, et il n'y a pas beaucoup de bonnes âmes prêtes à aider un vieux cowboy comme moi.${prompt}
  8174: |-
    Tu veux vraiment abandonner ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  8175: Je savais que tu serais là pour moi, ${name-player}. Maintenant, sors et va couper ! Prends ton temps si tu es occupé avec tes autres aventures.${prompt}
  8176: Mon garçon, vous les jeunes de nos jours, vous n'avez aucun respect. Vous donnez votre parole à quelqu'un, puis vous revenez dessus comme si ça ne comptait pas du tout.${prompt}
  8177: Je suppose que je vais devoir trouver quelqu'un d'autre pour m'aider. Maintenant, prends ta hache et va-t'en.${prompt}
  8178: Je ne sais pas... Je ne pense pas pouvoir encore décider. Tranche encore quelques monstres, puis ramène-la-moi pour un autre coup d'œil.${prompt}
  8179: Eh bien, je n'en crois pas mes yeux ! Tu as travaillé cette hache si dur que je pourrais frapper Osker sur la tête avec et il n'aurait même pas une égratignure. Maintenant, je pense que je vais pouvoir décider quelle hache recommander au Tenshodo.${prompt}
  8180: À vrai dire, ${name-player}, je ne pensais pas que tu serais capable de réussir ce test. Je suis vraiment impressionné. Pour montrer ma véritable gratitude, que dirais-tu de mettre tes compétences de manieur de hache à un vrai test ?${prompt}
  8181: Quand j'étais encore un jeune fougueux, mes partenaires et moi avions l'habitude de rivaliser pour savoir qui était le plus fort de notre groupe. Cela n'avait pas vraiment de sens, mais c'était amusant et ça nous aidait à prendre confiance sur le champ de bataille.${prompt}
  8182: Et après quelques-unes de ces séances, je pouvais sentir mes compétences devenir de plus en plus affinées, jusqu'à ce que je puisse écraser tout ce qui se trouvait sur mon chemin.${prompt}
  8183: 'Tiens, prends ce ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} et rends-toi au Temple d’Uggalepih. Une fois là-bas, tout ce que tu as à faire, c’est de trouver ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}. Ramène-le-moi, et ce sera fait. Ça a l’air simple, mais tu ferais mieux d’être bien préparé. J’ai vu plus d’un ami se faire malmener par la bête qui vit dans cet endroit.${prompt}'
  8184: 'Prends ce ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} et rends-toi au Temple d’Uggalepih. Une fois là-bas, trouve ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} et ramène-le-moi... mais fais attention, compris ?${prompt}'
  8185: Ha hah ! Toi, vaurien ! Je peux dire par le sourire sur ton visage que tu as botté ce monstre au derrière !${prompt}
  8186: 'Mais assez parlé ! Voyons ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  8187: Whoa ! J'aimerais être aussi fort que toi et mon patron un jour ! Non, un jour je serai aussi fort que toi. Attends de voir !${prompt}
  8188: '...Je te tire mon chapeau, ${name-player}.${prompt}'
  8189: Tant qu'il y aura des ${choice-player-gender}[hommes/femmes] tenaces comme toi à Vana'diel, il n'y aura pas à s'inquiéter des bêtes ou des Seigneurs des Ombres.${prompt}
  8190: Maintenant, il est temps de retourner au travail. Osker ! Arrête de traîner !${prompt}
  8191: Plus de travail ? Je n'aurai jamais l'occasion de m'entraîner avec ma hache !${prompt}
  8192: Oh, arrête de te plaindre. Un de mes amis devrait arriver d'une minute à l'autre.${prompt}
  8193: Un ami ? Waouh, je ne pensais pas que tu avais des amis, patron.${prompt}
  8194: Tu ferais mieux de fermer ton clapet, Osker, ou je vais le coller !${prompt}
  8195: Salut, Brutus. J'ai rapporté la hache que tu m'avais demandé de tester. C'est une belle pièce, mais la tête est un peu trop lourde à mon goût.${prompt} 
  8196: Au fait, Brutus, tu te souviens quel jour on est aujourd'hui ?${prompt}
  8197: Quel jour ? Bien sûr que je m'en souviens ! Un coup d'œil au calendrier là-bas et...${prompt}
  8198: Ne me dis pas que tu as oublié qu'aujourd'hui était le jour où tu devais me laisser monter mon vieux chocobo ?${prompt}
  8199: |-
    Ha ha ha ! Je t'ai bien eu, pas vrai ? Bien sûr que je m'en souviens.
    Tu as fait du bon travail avec cette fille. Tout le monde ici aux écuries ne tarit pas d'éloges sur le fait qu'elle est la plus facile à gérer.${prompt}
  8200: Les aventuriers aussi ! Ils disent qu'elle est le chocobo le plus obéissant qu'ils aient jamais monté.${prompt}
  8201: Heh heh. Ils n'ont pas dit ça, hein ?${prompt}
  8202: Est-ce que je te mentirais ? Tu es devenu un sacré dompteur de bêtes, si tu veux mon avis.${prompt}
  8203: Ses blessures ne sont pas encore totalement guéries, mais je ne pense pas qu'une petite balade autour du duché lui ferait du mal. Vas-y !${prompt}
  8204: Encore merci, Brutus.${prompt}
  8205: Mais tu sais... je m'inquiète toujours qu'elle ne me fasse pas encore confiance pour la monter... après tout ce que je lui ai fait subir...${prompt}
  8206: Tu t'inquiètes encore pour ça ? Allez, regarde ses yeux.${prompt}
  8207: Ils brillent aussi fort que les tiens, Dietmund.${prompt}
  8208: Brutus...${prompt}
  8209: Hé, hé ! Tu ne vas quand même pas te ramollir maintenant, hein ?${prompt}
  8210: J-Je... je ne sais pas quoi dire. Je crois que j'ai quelque chose dans l'œil...${prompt}
  8211: Si tout ce que tu comptes faire, c'est rester là à pleurnicher, alors dégage de mes écuries ! Tu fais fuir les clients !${prompt}
  8212: M-Merci, Brutus...${prompt}
  8213: Non, merci à vous tous. Je n'oublierai jamais ce jour... jamais...${prompt}
  8214: Vous avez appris la compétence d'arme « Décimation » !${prompt}
  8215: |-
    Tu vois, Dietmund est revenu, comme je te l'avais dit. Je pouvais le lire dans ses yeux.
    Les gens ne sont pas si différents des chocobos, tu sais. Tu peux toujours deviner ce qu'ils pensent en regardant bien leurs yeux, qu'ils soient bleus, noirs, ou de n'importe quelle couleur.${prompt}
  8216: |-
    Cette fille ne va pas tarder à retourner chez son maître...
    Mais tu ne me verras pas pleurer ! M. Dietmund m'a promis que je pourrais la monter quand je veux !${prompt}
  8217: Le chocobo a l'air extrêmement heureux.${prompt}
  8218: Comment va-t-il ?${prompt}
  8219: Eh bien, il ne semble pas avoir de blessures externes. Pour tout te dire, je ne sais pas exactement ce qui ne va pas avec lui.${prompt}
  8220: |-
    Tu ne sais pas exactement ?
    Donc tu as une sorte de théorie ?${prompt}
  8221: |-
    ...
    Je suis désolé, mais je ne suis pas disposé à parler de l'état d'un patient. Pas même au capitaine de la Garde ducale.${prompt}

    Comme tu veux. Mais ce garçon est un témoin important. Quand il se réveillera, il sera interrogé.
    A-t-il montré des signes de conscience ?${prompt}
  8223: J'ai bien peur que non...${prompt}
  8224: Wolfgang, que s'est-il vraiment passé dans cette pièce ? Qu'était cet appareil, et que cherchaient à faire les scientifiques de Jeuno avec lui ? Tu sais quelque chose, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8225: Vous n'avez pas à vous inquiéter des affaires du Duché.${prompt}
  8226: |-
    Je vois... Je suppose que certaines choses valent mieux rester inconnues.
    Je me demande souvent s'il faut informer un patient lorsque sa maladie est incurable. Cependant, s'il reste ne serait-ce qu'un mince espoir de la guérir...${prompt}
  8227: Si vous insinuez que Jeuno est malade, vous faites erreur.${prompt}
  8228: |-
    <Soupir>
    Laissez-moi reformuler ma question.${prompt}
  8229: D'ami à ami, que s'est-il simplement passé ce jour-là ?${prompt}
  8230: Je... je ne sais vraiment pas. C'est pourquoi il est crucial que nous interrogions ce garçon.${prompt}
  8231: S'il n'a rien de grave, alors il n'y a aucune raison pour que nous ne puissions pas le transporter immédiatement au Palais du Grand-Duc. Monberaux, préparez son transfert.${prompt}
  8232: |-
    Ah, c'est vous...
    Autant j'aimerais m'asseoir et discuter de vos aventures autour d'une bonne tasse de thé de San d'Oria, ce n'est pas vraiment le moment.${prompt}
  8233: |-
    Attendez.
    Peut-être savez-vous quelque chose sur ce qui s'est passé près de la mer de Shu'Meyo. Récemment, j'ai entendu d'étranges rumeurs...${prompt}
  8234: Docteur Monberaux, il y a beaucoup d'agitation à l'extérieur de l'infirmerie. Pensez-vous que les gardes ducaux soient de retour ?${prompt}
  8235: Ces bâtards égoïstes ! Ne pensent-ils qu'à leur propre intérêt ?${prompt}
  8236: Je m'excuse, mais je dois d'abord m'occuper de quelque chose.${prompt}
  8237: Et nous ne pouvons obtenir aucune réponse tant que ce garçon n'est pas réveillé et en garde à vue ! Remettez-le-nous ! C'est un ordre !${prompt}
  8238: Vous pouvez m'ordonner tout ce que vous voulez, mais je ne vous permettrai pas de réveiller ce garçon !${prompt}
  8239: Messieurs, vous avez vos ordres.${prompt}
  8240: |-
    Attendez, Wolfgang !
    Qu'avez-vous l'intention de lui faire ? Je ne vous laisserai pas malmener mes patients de la sorte !${prompt}
  8241: |-
    Que se passe-t-il !?
    ...!?${prompt}
  8242: 'Il... Il a juste disparu !${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  8243: 'Ne restez pas plantés là ! Scellez la zone ! Je ne veux voir aucun homme, femme, chien ou chat quitter Jeuno-Haut. Ce garçon ne peut pas se cacher longtemps.${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  8244: J'ai déjà vu cet enfant quelque part...${prompt}
  8245: |-
    Je ne comprends pas. Aucun signe de conscience pendant des heures, puis il se réveille soudainement et s'enfuit...
    Il doit y avoir une explication à cela...${prompt}
  8246: Je suis désolé que vous ayez dû assister à cet échange. J'aimerais mieux vous expliquer ce qui vient de se passer, mais moi-même je suis perplexe face aux événements d'aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  8247: |-
    Tout va bien ?
    Vous avez l'air légèrement pâle.${prompt}
  8248: Eh bien, j'espère que ce n'est rien de grave.${prompt}
  8249: |-
    Ce médaillon que vous tenez. Il appartient au garçon, n'est-ce pas ?
    Qu'est-ce que c'est ? Vous dites qu'il vous l'a donné ?${prompt}
  8250: Je vous suggère de le garder. Cela pourrait nous donner des indices sur ce qui se passe réellement. Cela pourrait aussi...${prompt}
  8251: '...Laissez tomber.${prompt}'
  8252: |-
    Peut-être devrais-je commencer mes rondes dans les Jardins de Ru'Lude. Je pourrais récolter des informations précieuses.
    J'ai le sentiment que la situation là-haut est encore plus tendue qu'ici...${prompt}
  8253: |-
    D'un point de vue médical, c'est un miracle que ce garçon se soit réveillé.
    Je ne peux pas l'expliquer...${prompt}
  8254: Pourquoi Wolfgang a-t-il tant besoin de lui parler ?${prompt}
  8255: Peut-être devriez-vous visiter les Jardins de Ru'Lude. J'ai le sentiment que la situation là-haut est encore plus tendue qu'ici.${prompt}
  8256: Une connaissance du patient qui vient d'être admis ?${prompt}
  8257: C'est exact. Où est-elle ?${prompt}
  8258: Ah, vous connaissez également le patient ? Vous pouvez accompagner ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8259: Cependant, je dois vous avertir. Son état est encore très instable. Elle semble terriblement souffrir...${prompt}
  8260: Prishe !${prompt}
  8261: Attendez, vous êtes...${prompt}
  8262: Vous vous connaissez ? Ce noble guerrier est celui qui a amené notre princesse inconsciente.${prompt}
  8263: Sir Tenzen... l'aventurier, ${name-player}, semble également connaître le patient.${prompt}
  8264: |-
    Prishe...
    Quel sombre destin s'est abattu sur toi...?${prompt}
  8265: '...Gardienne...${prompt}'
  8266: Prishe ?${prompt}
  8267: '...de l’...Apocalypse...${prompt}'
  8268: Gardienne de l'Apocalypse ? De quoi parlez-vous ?${prompt}
  8269: '!?${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  8270: |-
    M'appeler...
    ...Arrêtez !
    ...Éloignez-vous !${prompt}
  8271: N-non...!${prompt}
  8272: Son amulette ! Elle a disparu !${prompt}
  8273: Vous ! N'avez-vous pas vu une amulette autour du cou de ma chère amie ? Sans elle, elle...${prompt}
  8274: Je suis désolé, mademoiselle, mais au moment où je l'ai trouvée, elle n'avait pas cette amulette dont vous parlez.${prompt}
  8275: Impossible...${prompt}
  8276: Attendez ! ${name-player}, pourriez-vous me montrer votre amulette ?${prompt}
  8277: |-
    J'ai l'impression que les deux pourraient être connectées d'une manière ou d'une autre.
    Je vous en prie ! C'est peut-être notre seul moyen de sauver Prishe !${prompt}
  8278: |-
    L'état du patient s'est stabilisé. Cependant, elle ne montre aucun signe de réveil du profond sommeil dans lequel elle est plongée.
    En toutes mes années de médecine, je n'ai jamais vu quelque chose de semblable...${prompt}
  8279: ${name-player}, pensez-vous vraiment que tout cela a un lien avec cette amulette ?${prompt}
  8280: Si seulement le mystérieux garçon qui l'a laissée tomber était encore ici, il pourrait peut-être nous aider à éclaircir la situation dans laquelle nous nous trouvons...${prompt}
  8281: Un garçon...? Vous ne parlez pas du même garçon que celui recherché par la Garde Ducale, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8282: Qu'est-ce que c'est ? Avez-vous également entendu parler des rumeurs concernant ce jeune homme étrange qui a disparu il y a quelques jours ?${prompt}
  8283: Lors d'une visite au palais, on m'a parlé d'un certain garçon dangereux.${prompt}
  8284: |-
    Je vois...
    Ainsi, ce garçon portait une amulette semblable à celle de la fille. Cela pourrait expliquer pourquoi elle a été attaquée...${prompt}
  8285: Mais l'amulette de Prishe a été donnée par le Cardinal Mildaurion. Il est absurde de penser que le cardinal pourrait être associé à des criminels !${prompt}
  8286: Le Cardinal Mildaurion de la cathédrale de Tavnazia ?${prompt}
  8287: Oui. Il y a longtemps, le cardinal a donné l'amulette à Prishe après qu'elle ait été gravement blessée dans un accident. Elle a dit que c'était pour la protéger.${prompt}
  8288: |-
    Depuis ce jour, elle ne s'est jamais séparée de l'amulette.
    Mais pourquoi quelqu'un voudrait-il la voler...?${prompt}
  8289: Peut-être que c'est le garçon qui a volé l'amulette de la patiente. Cependant, il y a quelques jours, j'ai entendu dire que le garçon avait été aperçu récemment dans les ruines de Pso'Xja, situées profondément dans les redoutables Terres du Nord.${prompt}
  8290: Quoi !? Vous en êtes sûr !?${prompt}
  8291: Un soldat que j'ai soigné pour hypothermie a mentionné que son groupe l'avait vu seul dans les ruines. Lorsque la Garde Ducale a appris cela, elle est partie immédiatement pour les Terres du Nord.${prompt}
  8292: |-
    Donc, le quatrième cristal se trouve dans les ruines de Pso'Xja...
    Je n'ai pas de temps à perdre.${prompt}
  8293: Attendez !${prompt}
  8294: Avant de partir pour votre voyage, je dois vous informer que les ruines sont contrôlées par une organisation connue sous le nom de Tenshodo. Vous devriez probablement les consulter en premier.${prompt}
  8295: |-
    Je vois...
    Merci pour cette information.
    Bonne journée, Docteur !${prompt}
  8296: Je me demande s'il pourrait y avoir un lien entre le garçon et cette jeune femme, Prishe.${prompt}
  8297: Selon les rumeurs parmi la Garde Ducale, quelqu'un l'a vu dans la tour centrale des ruines nord de Pso'Xja. Cependant, pour entrer dans les parties les plus profondes de ces tours, il est nécessaire d'obtenir la permission des Tenshodo...${prompt}
  8298: Vous dites que vous connaissez l'Elvaan qui s'est effondrée ici ?${prompt}
  8299: |-
    Un voyageur étrangement vêtu venu de l'Est l'a emmenée à la clinique du Docteur Monberaux.
    Oh, j'espère qu'elle va bien.${prompt}
  8300: Contrairement aux rumeurs peu reluisantes qui circulent dans les rues du Duché, l'Elvaan qui s'est effondrée ici n'a pas été attaquée par un sombre assaillant.${prompt}
  8301: Alors qu'elle s'agenouillait devant la statue de la Déesse pour offrir une prière, elle s'est soudainement effondrée au sol et a commencé à convulser violemment. J'ai tenté de purifier son âme des terribles démons qui la possédaient ; cependant, mon eau bénite n'a eu aucun effet.${prompt}
  8302: Je ne peux qu'espérer que mes prières pour sa sécurité atteignent rapidement la Déesse.${prompt}
  8303: |-
    ...
    Je... Je m'excuse. Je ne suis plus moi-même depuis que l'Elvaan a eu son... accident.${prompt}
  8304: Je sais que Mère Chiphraix insiste sur le fait qu'il n'y a eu aucune mauvaise intention, mais je jurerais avoir ressenti une présence obscure derrière la fille avant qu'elle ne s'effondre.${prompt}
  8305: Et maintenant, chaque fois que j'y pense, je deviens étourdi et pris de vertiges...${prompt}
  8306: Si vous êtes ici pour voir la fille, elle est réveillée depuis quelques heures.${prompt}
  8307: De quoi pensez-vous parler !? Il n'y a aucun moyen que la cardinale ait pu...${prompt}
  8308: Je sais, mais même si c'était le cas, je suis sûr qu'il y a une explication raisonnable.${prompt}
  8309: Oh, ${name-player}. Je ne saurais exprimer ma gratitude pour avoir sauvé Prishe.${prompt}
  8310: Elle m'a informé de ce qui s'est passé ce jour-là.${prompt}
  8311: Possédée par une bête inconnue dans son propre rêve...${prompt}
  8312: Vous et Tenzen avez réussi à la ramener. Cependant, nous ne savons toujours pas ce qu'est devenu l'amulette qu'elle portait.${prompt}
  8313: J'ai l'impression que ce qui s'est passé ces derniers jours n'est que la pointe de l'iceberg.${prompt}
  8314: ${name-player}, pouvez-vous nous en dire plus ?${prompt}
  8315: C'est la question que nous devrions vous poser !${prompt}
  8316: Quels sont vos liens avec ce criminel que moi, le Duché et ${name-player} recherchons ?${prompt}
  8317: Le garçon qui échappe constamment à la Garde Ducale — où se cache-t-il ?${prompt}
  8318: Prishe, vous devez me répondre. Pourquoi ce garçon était-il avec vous, et où a-t-il disparu ?${prompt}
  8319: |-
    Aucune idée...
    Mais une chose est sûre : je m'en fiche qu'il soit en haut de la liste des personnes recherchées de Jeuno. Sans lui pour me sauver la mise, je serais déjà en train de pousser des lilas dans la nécropole.${prompt}
  8320: Quoi qu'il en soit, ce n'est pas le garçon qui m'inquiète. Que comptez-vous faire à propos de ce monstre dans mon rêve ? Vous avez dit que vous saviez ce que c'était, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8321: Allez ! Crachez le morceau, vieux fou ! Pourquoi cette chose s'en prend-elle à moi ?${prompt}
  8322: Diabolos... Avatar terrestre des rêves...${prompt}
  8323: Avatar terrestre...?${prompt}
  8324: Les avatars terrestres sont les cinq dieux puissants nés de Vana'diel et chargés de la protéger.${prompt}
  8325: Il y a de nombreux éons, les cinq avatars ont livré une bataille féroce contre une présence maléfique qui tentait d'envelopper et d'étouffer notre monde.${prompt}
  8326: Il y a l'oiseau de feu de la résurrection, Phœnix, dont la lame que je porte à mon côté a été bénie.${prompt}
  8327: Et puis il y a le maître des rêves, Diabolos ; le gardien de la lune, Fenrir ; le porteur d'arcs-en-ciel, Carbuncle ; et le conquérant des cieux, Bahamut...${prompt}
  8328: Ba-Bahamut !?${prompt}
  8329: |-
    Vous avez entendu parler de la légende de Bahamut ?
    Il se trouve que j'ai traversé de nombreux malms d'océan pour venir sur ce continent afin de rencontrer Bahamut... et de demander son aide pour arrêter le Gardien de l'Apocalypse.${prompt}
  8330: '!!!${prompt}'
  8331: Maintenant que vous en parlez, quand je suis allé au Cap Riverne, je me souviens que Bahamut a mentionné quelque chose à propos d'un gardien...${prompt}
  8332: Gardien de l'Apocalypse... Prishe ! Ce sont les mots que tu as prononcés pendant que tu étais inconsciente !${prompt}
  8333: |-
    Tout ce dont je me souviens, c'est qu'avant que vous arriviez, ce monstre Diabolos parlait d'une chanson qui parlait du gardien.
    Comment ça s'appelait déjà...? « Memoria de la S^tona » ?${prompt}
  8334: La mémoire du cristal...${prompt}
  8335: Il a aussi dit que lorsque le gardien arrivera, « notre pacte sera accompli ». Quoi que cela signifie...${prompt}
  8336: Et c'est pour ça qu'il m'a dit d'aller voir Bahamut dès que possible...${prompt}
  8337: |-
    « Notre pacte »...
    Que pouvait-il vouloir dire...?${prompt}
  8338: Aucune idée, et je n'ai pas l'intention de retourner là-bas pour lui demander.${prompt}
  8339: Mais j'ai le sentiment que Bahamut pourrait nous donner les détails. C'est pourquoi nous devons retourner à Tavnazia !${prompt}
  8340: Retourner à Tavnazia ? Vous voulez dire que vous venez du Marquisat ?${prompt}
  8341: C'est exact. Cependant, nous avons été téléportés ici par Bahamut lorsque nous avons essayé de lui parler...${prompt}
  8342: Quelle tournure d'événements excellente !${prompt}
  8343: Il se trouve justement que j'ai demandé un transport pour Tavnazia au chef des Tenshodo, Aldo. Si c'est possible, j'aimerais que vous deux m'accompagniez pour m'aider à trouver Bahamut !${prompt}
  8344: Alors c'est toi dont Aldo parlait...${prompt}
  8345: Eh bien, plus on est de fous, plus on rit, non ? On se retrouve au Tenshodo quand vous serez prêts à partir.${prompt}
  8346: Compris !${prompt}
  8347: Oh, et toi, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8348: Je vais garder cet amulette encore un petit moment. Ça te pose un problème ?${prompt}
  8349: Hé, et quand tu auras fini tes affaires ici, pourquoi ne pas revenir à Tavnazia ? Tu connais le chemin, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8350: À bientôt !${prompt}
  8351: 'Vous prêtez le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} à Prishe.${prompt}'
  8352: |-
    Je suis ravi de voir ma jeune patiente complètement rétablie.
    Elle est drôlement énergique lorsqu'elle est consciente, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8353: |-
    Il semble que nos visiteurs soient retournés à Tavnazia.
    J'avoue avoir été très surpris d'apprendre que la nation existait encore.${prompt}
  8354: ${name-player}, il semble que vous ayez vécu une épreuve difficile dans les Northlands.${prompt}
  8355: J'ai essayé de recueillir des informations auprès de la Garde Ducale ; cependant, aucun d'eux ne veut — ou devrais-je dire, n'est autorisé — à parler de l'affaire, bien que la peur dans leurs yeux en dise long.${prompt}
  8356: |-
    Et ce n'est pas tout...
    Récemment, il y a eu des rumeurs inquiétantes disant que la fin du monde est proche.${prompt}
  8357: Ces rumeurs disent aussi que la jeune patiente que j'ai soignée — la fille à qui on a volé l'amulette — est liée à tout cela d'une manière ou d'une autre.${prompt}
  8358: J'ai même entendu dire que la Garde Ducale avait un mandat d'arrêt contre elle...${prompt}
  8359: Absurde ! Dame Prishe est simplement utilisée. Le vrai criminel, c'est ce garçon !${prompt}
  8360: Tiens, n'est-ce pas...${prompt}
  8361: Je m'excuse pour mon entrée soudaine, Docteur.${prompt}
  8362: |-
    ${name-player} !
    Quelque chose de terrible est en train de se produire !${prompt}
  8363: Je viens du Palais du Grand Duc, où j'ai entendu parler du plan ridicule du Duché. Jeuno a commencé à mobiliser la Garde Ducale en préparation d'une attaque contre... Bahamut !${prompt}
  8364: Oui, Bahamut a menacé Vana'diel avec la promesse d'une apocalypse. Cependant, il reste l'un des avatars terrestres chargés de protéger notre monde.${prompt}
  8365: Il doit y avoir un moyen de convaincre le conquérant des cieux... et c'est pourquoi j'ai demandé à accompagner le commandant de cette opération, Dame Esha'ntarl. Malheureusement...${prompt}
  8366: '...le commandant n’était pas du genre à écouter raison. Elle est convaincue qu’il serait futile d’essayer de communiquer avec Bahamut, et que la seule façon de sauver les habitants de Vana''diel est d’attaquer le Roi Dragon et ses sbires avant qu’ils n’attaquent nos cités.${prompt}'
  8367: Excusez-moi, monsieur. Je ne suis pas sûr de comprendre entièrement ce que vous essayez de dire.${prompt}
  8368: Bahamut se prépare à lancer une attaque sur les quatre nations ? Cela ne peut pas être vrai !${prompt}
  8369: Mais si c'était le cas...${prompt}
  8370: Les dirigeants des nations ont-ils été informés ? Leurs armées ont-elles commencé à se préparer ?${prompt}
  8371: Malheureusement, il est probable que San d'Oria, Bastok et Windurst restent ignorants de la situation. Et même s'ils étaient informés, ils n'auraient aucun moyen de monter une contre-attaque.${prompt}
  8372: Bahamut est connu comme le conquérant des cieux pour une raison. Le pouvoir qu'il détient, lui et ses sbires, dépasse tout ce que nous pourrions imaginer:le pouvoir de contrôler le temps et l'espace.${prompt}
  8373: Contrôler le temps et l'espace...?${prompt}
  8374: Le moment où lui et ses sbires arriveraient au-dessus de nos cités serait le moment de notre défaite. Nous n'aurions d'autre choix que d'accepter l'anéantissement...${prompt}
  8375: '...${prompt}'
  8376: Mais je pense qu'il y a encore un moyen...${prompt}
  8377: Dame Esha'ntarl a mentionné que Bahamut accumule actuellement l'énergie nécessaire pour téléporter ses congénères vers les lieux d'attaque.${prompt}
  8378: Si nous pouvions atteindre Bahamut avant qu'il n'ait stocké suffisamment d'énergie, nous pourrions peut-être le convaincre de ne pas commencer son embuscade contre Vana'diel.${prompt}
  8379: Le convaincre ? La fin du monde est imminente, et vous voulez vous asseoir et discuter avec celui qui l'apporte !?${prompt}
  8380: |-
    Exactement !
    Avec la Lame du Phénix et ${name-player} à mes côtés, je suis convaincu que je peux persuader Bahamut d'épargner la vie des habitants de ce monde.${prompt}
  8381: Mais pour réussir, j'ai besoin de votre aide, Docteur.${prompt}
  8382: Je dois savoir où ce garçon a été découvert pour la première fois !${prompt}
  8383: '...!${prompt}'
  8384: |-
    ...
    Understood.
    Wolfgang, captain of the Ducal Guard, ordered me not to reveal this information to anyone...however, I am afraid I no longer have any choice.${prompt}
  8385: On the first floor of Delkfutt's Tower, there is a large doorway that leads into the deeper areas of the spire.${prompt}
  8386: It is somewhere down there that the boy mysteriously appeared. A large, central chamber...but that is all I remember.${prompt}
  8387: |-
    I am extremely grateful for all you have done for us, Doctor.
    Come, ${name-player}, we have no time to lose.${prompt}
  8388: Ah, but there is a door--a locked door, and only Wolfgang knows how to open it.${prompt}
  8389: I have no worries, as Phoenix will lead the way.${prompt}
  8390: ${name-player}, make your preparations quickly and meet me at the tower.${prompt}
  8391: ${name-player}, it may be a worthless effort, but let me ask Wolfgang for the key to that chamber.${prompt}
  8392: While sometimes misled, he is a man who strongly believes in justice. He may feel that it is solely his duty to protect the world on the eve of its destruction.${prompt}
  8393: |-
    We must let him know that there are those of us who also follow the same path as he.
    Here. Take this envelope to the palace guard post. I will be praying for your success, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8394: |-
    The boy first appeared in Delkfutt's Tower.
    On the first floor of the tower, there is a large doorway that leads into the deeper areas of the structure...${prompt}
  8395: |-
    Wolfgang will know how to open the door that lies beyond.
    Take this envelope to the palace guard post. I will be praying for your success, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8396: I see by his reaction that Wolfgang understood the meaning of the map.${prompt}
  8397: |-
    Where should you go? Hah hah. That's a secret, ${name-player}.
    Though, if you think hard enough, I feel you will come to understand.${prompt}
  8398: |-
    I knew all along Wolfgang would come. He is a good man, despite being a little stubborn.
    Now hurry to Delkfutt's Tower. Tenzen should already be on his way.${prompt}
  8399: Somewhere on the first floor there is a large doorway that leads to the basement of the tower. The key you received from Wolfgang will open that door.${prompt}
  8400: Wolfgang should not be giving you any more problems. I think he has finally started to realize what is truly important in this world.${prompt}
  8401: |-
    Have you heard the rumors?
    Some are saying that the end of the world is upon us.${prompt}
  8402: Thanks to that, we here at the clinic have lately been spending more time mending people's spirits than their broken bones.${prompt}
  8403: ${name-player}, it is good to see you.${prompt}
  8404: We have finally grasped the entire tapestry that our separate tales have woven.${prompt}
  8405: I never believed that something like this was possible.${prompt}
  8406: I suggest you prepare yourself before Lady Ulmia arrives.${prompt}
  8407: Why is everyone so quiet? Is something wrong?${prompt}
  8408: |-
    Lady Ulmia, we have been waiting for you.
    Will you steel your heart and listen to the story we have to tell?${prompt}
  8409: Of course, we have tried to refute this conclusion and find some other explanation.${prompt}
  8410: However, we now know that the boy, Selh'teus, has come to thwart the plans of the ancient ones and steal the light of the crystals.${prompt}
  8411: We also know that the Divinity of Darkness that rules over the Kindred was not Promathia after all.${prompt}
  8412: But...the Moblins...heard from...the Divinity of Darkness...that the...Keeper of the Apocalypse...has already...arisen.${prompt}
  8413: And surely you have seen the magicite imbedded in Prishe's chest?${prompt}
  8414: According to your explanation, that stone contained the Emptiness of the Twilight God, Promathia.${prompt}
  8415: |-
    Lady Ulmia.
    This must come as a shock for one so close to Lady Prishe.${prompt}
  8416: But I must inform you of the facts I have learned from the terrestrial avatars Carbuncle and Fenrir.${prompt}
  8417: After ten thousand years, the Keeper of the Apocalypse was fated to be born in the nation of Tavnazia!${prompt}
  8418: Surely you are not saying that this keeper you speak of is Prishe!${prompt}
  8419: |-
    That is impossible!
    I refuse to believe it!${prompt}
  8420: We have been friends since the time before Tavnazia's destruction!${prompt}
  8421: I can honestly say that I have never met a person more pure of heart.${prompt}
  8422: She has more faith, and more courage...${prompt}
  8423: How could she be the Keeper of the Apocalypse and still urge Diabolos to save the world?${prompt}
  8424: It is true that I do not know of anyone who possesses the zest for life that Prishe has.${prompt}
  8425: And if we had but the time and the knowledge, we would rescue Lady Prishe from this destiny.${prompt}
  8426: However, we have no time remaining.${prompt}
  8427: |-
    A duty lies before us:
    Lord Bahamut and his minions must be stopped!${prompt}
  8428: And if Cardinal Mildaurion is still alive as we believe, she will be planning to use Prishe to awaken the Twilight God.${prompt}
  8429: With Prishe and her magicite in the cardinal's possession, the world is one step away from oblivion!${prompt}
  8430: When Promathia...awakens...there will be...no stopping...the Moblins.${prompt}
  8431: |-
    Stop it, all of you.
    You truly intend to do away with Prishe if it means the plans of Wyrmking Bahamut will be prevented?${prompt}
  8432: That is something I cannot do!${prompt}
  8433: Lady Ulmia!${prompt}
  8434: '...${prompt}'
  8435: |-
    Let her be.
    The first thing we have to do is rrrescue Prishe from the Grand Duke Palace.
    I'll start working on a plan.${prompt}
  8436: |-
    I will call upon some old acquaintances.
    They may be able to help us.${prompt}
  8437: |-
    I wish...no more lives...to be lost.
    I...will do...what I can.${prompt}
  8438: ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8439: Do you agree with our decision?${prompt}
  8440: |-
    Do you agree?
    ${selection-lines}
    No, I don't.
    There's no other way.
    What decision?${prompt}
  8441: Do not let our actions concern you.${prompt}
  8442: You are free to follow your own path from here.${prompt}
  8443: |-
    I only ask that you look after Lady Ulmia.
    She did not take this news well.${prompt}
  8444: There is little you can say to comfort her, but at least see her safely to Tavnazia.${prompt}
  8445: If you ask the aid of Lady Esha'ntarl, I am sure your return will be a swift one.${prompt}
  8446: Until we meet again!${prompt}
  8447: |-
    You understand what we have all agreed to here?
    We have come to a brutal and bloody conclusion.${prompt}
  8448: Although no one life holds more importance than another, I have a duty to save the world, no matter the cost.${prompt}
  8449: |-
    But still...
    I worry for Lady Ulmia.${prompt}
  8450: In order to save the world from destruction, we must defeat the one known as the Keeper of the Apocalypse.${prompt}
  8451: Even if Lady Prishe herself is the Keeper, I will not fail to carry out this task.${prompt}
  8452: |-
    A beautiful lady justaru ran that way, tears streaming down her face.
    I've never seen anything like it.${prompt}
  8453: |-
    Today is Tarutaru day at the pub, and she was an Elvaan.
    I can understand how that'd make you want to cry.${prompt}
  8454: I am glad to see that you have all survived unscathed.${prompt}
  8455: You...!${prompt}
  8456: You are...the priest...!?${prompt}
  8457: Nice to see you both again after so long.${prompt}
  8458: |-
    It's been twenty years since I've seen you, Shikaree Z.
    And a hundred years for you, Jabbos, if I'm not mistaken.${prompt}
  8459: And you, the man of extraordinary luck.${prompt}
  8460: I am most delighted to be in your presence once more, Cardinal Mildaurion.${prompt}
  8461: I would love to celebrate this long overdue reunion; however, now is not the time.${prompt}
  8462: Lord Bahamut has revealed to us an unsettling truth--the Keeper of the Apocalypse waits in the celestial capital of Al'Taieu.${prompt}
  8463: Until now, the Armathrwn Society had believed the city of Al'Taieu destroyed.${prompt}
  8464: Judging by the counsel of the terrestrial avatars and the memories of Selh'teus, however, we can assume that the celestial capital still exists.${prompt}
  8465: |-
    The society is now focused on gaining further information.
    To this end, the objective of our next operation is to capture--not kill--Lord Bahamut.${prompt}
  8466: I, Esha'ntarl, will join the main fleet of warships and head once more to the ends of the earth.${prompt}
  8467: But there is another important matter that requires our immediate attention--a matter involving the fifth mothercrystal.${prompt}
  8468: Someone has apparently severed the fifth crystal from the Crystal Line.${prompt}
  8469: When the boy, Selh'teus, appeared, was not this Crystal Line the conduit he traversed with Lord Bahamut?${prompt}
  8470: |-
    Just a damn moment!
    So now we can't use this pipeline gizmo to get to the fifth mothercrystal!?${prompt}
  8471: How are we supposed to get to Al'Taieu and wipe the floor with the Keeper of the Apocalypse!?${prompt}
  8472: |-
    How, indeed.
    In any event, we must search for an alternative route now that Phoenix is no longer with us.${prompt}
  8473: |-
    Wait.
    Mildaurion, you mentioned that “someone” isolated the fifth mothercrystal?${prompt}

  8480: This is most worrisome. I shall follow him and see he does not come to harm.${prompt}
  8481: I will accompany you!${prompt}
  8482: I realize that Jabbos has tried for years to convince the Moblins that they are not the children of Promathia.${prompt}
  8483: But for the sake of the mothercrystal, the Moblins cannot be left to their own devices.${prompt}
  8484: If he fails to persuade them otherwise, they may attempt to destroy the fifth crystal.${prompt}
  8485: Destroy the crystal!?${prompt}
  8486: The mothercrystal is at both the beginning and the end of a person's journey in this life.${prompt}
  8487: After learning this fact from Jabbos, the Moblins now believe that destroying the mothercrystal will spell the end for the children of Altana.${prompt}
  8488: How could Jabbos fail to mention something so important!?${prompt}
  8489: |-
    He had no choice.

  8503: |-
    Not a momentaru ago, there were Mithra and Galka and all sorts filing out the door.
    They were saying something about going to Movalpolos.${prompt}

    Are they thinking of bringing their beastmen buddies back here?
    Next thing you know, they'll be having “Goblin's Day.”${prompt}

  8509: "Thank you, adventurer. \nPerhaps you have heard of the ruins of Pso'Xja, that are found on the Beaucedine Glacier?${prompt}"
  8510: It is whispered that those ruins are deeply entwined with the history of the ancients.${prompt}
  8511: When thieves discovered the mysterious structures in later years, they were quick to put up iron grates at the tower entrances and carry away the relics within.${prompt}
  8512: However, they were never able to open the decorated gate that lies in the deepest part of the ruins. The thieves searched for a way to open this portal for many years.${prompt}
  8513: |-
    Only recently did they finally stumble across the key to the gate.
    What they found inside apparently did not live up to their expectations.${prompt}
  8514: Believing that they had claimed all the treasures to be found, the Tenshodo opened almost every area of the six towers to adventurers.${prompt}
  8515: |-
    I do not agree with the Tenshodo's appraisal of their final discovery.
    The magical device that was hidden behind that gate closely resembles those that exist in the towers of Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  8516: Would this not mean that the towers of Pso'Xja have a similar function to the Sarutabaruta ruins?${prompt}
  8517: I have had adventurers who share your level of integrity delve into the ruins several times to investigate this possibility.${prompt}
  8518: |-
    I do not think the Tenshodo has given the matter due consideration.
    A magical device was found on the other side of that gate.${prompt}
  8519: No one knows the purpose behind the towers' construction, and it is far too dangerous to allow the general population access to the ruins without further research.${prompt}
  8520: And that is why I decided to ask adventurers who share your level of integrity to place a seal upon that gate.${prompt}
  8521: |-
    The only problem is, not one adventurer has been able to reach it.
    There are two other gates that block the path to the deepest section of the southwest tower.${prompt}
  8522: Will you attempt to find a way into the southwest tower's heart?${prompt}
  8523: |-
    Will you go?
    ${selection-lines}
    I will.
    I don't think so.${prompt}
  8524: |-
    You will be able to open the final gate with this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.
    It should also activate the magical device that lies beyond.${prompt}
  8525: |-
    Once the device is activated, return here for your reward.
    I pray for your success.${prompt}
  8526: |-
    Seal the final gate using this ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.
    I pray for your success.${prompt}
  8527: |-
    Find a way into the deepest section of the southwest tower, and activate the device that lies beyond the final gate.
    Both the gate and the device should respond to the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  8528: |-
    Find a way into the deepest section of the southwest tower, and seal the final gate with the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.

  8529: |-
    That was too close...
    Thankfully, the device was activated before those meddling scholars from Windurst arrived.${prompt}
  8530: |-
    But my work is not done.
    I must find a way to seal the device so that no one can stop it...${prompt}
  8531: |-
    You have my thanks.
    It appears the obstructions within the tower did not prevent you from activating the device.${prompt}
  8532: |-
    The devices within the other towers are also being activated, one by one.
    Please accept your reward.${prompt}
  8533: |-
    You have my thanks.
    It appears the obstructions within the tower did not prevent you from sealing the gate.${prompt}
  8534: |-
    Do not be concerned; the gates within the other towers are being sealed as we speak.
    Please accept your reward.${prompt}
  8535: |-
    Ah, the gate did not open for you?
    That is because a more experienced adventurer activated the device before you arrived.${prompt}
  8536: |-
    However, I still wish to recognize your sincere desire to carry out my request.
    Please accept this token of my appreciation.${prompt}
  8537: |-
    What would happen should all of the devices be activated?

  8611: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  8612: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  8613: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  8614: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  8615: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  8616: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  8617: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  8618: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}

  8624: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  8625: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  8626: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}
  8627: I was thinking this out loud when an Elvaan girl passing by stopped to talk to me.${prompt}
  8628: |-
    But what about moogles? They've got wings, and they can fly, but you wouldn't call 'em birds.
    They've got those funny antennae, too, but they're not insects, either.${prompt}
  8629: When I responded to her remark with the fact that both moogles and chocobos are animals, this is what she asked:${prompt}
  8630: Then what's the difference between animals and people?${prompt}
  8631: |-
    I answered, “People are smarter than animals.”
    And then she retorted, “People sure are more sly!”${prompt}
  8632: |-
    Ahahaha, don't get all huffy on me!
    I stopped to talk because what you were saying was important.${prompt}
  8633: |-
    People are all different from one another. They're different from animals, and different from plants.
    This difference is what makes it all worth it.${prompt}
  8634: |-
    There are lots of ways to think and feel, and things to know and to believe.
    But in the end, we all come from the same source.${prompt}
  8635: That's true for both people and animals.${prompt}
  8636: |-
    We all have this thing called a soul.
    The souls of animals are pure and simple.${prompt}
  8637: |-
    Look over there.
    That chocobo is living proof.${prompt}
  8638: |-
    You should ask someone how that chocobo was born.
    Then you'll have your answers.${prompt}
  8639: '...And then she went on her way.${prompt}'
  8640: I went to find out how that chocobo was born, but no one could tell me.${prompt}
  8641: Shalott said the chocobo's mother was from the stables in Bastok.${prompt}
  8642: She said it was a special chocobo that had silver-colored feathers on its neck.${prompt}
  8643: How I wish I could go to Bastok to see her for myself.${prompt}
  8644: I wonder if that Elvaan girl will be passing by again anytime soon...${prompt}
  8645: |-
    That Elvaan girl told me that both people and animals have souls.
    She said that the souls of animals are far more pure than those of people.${prompt}
  8646: She also told me I would understand what she meant if I found out how that chocobo was born.${prompt}
  8647: |-
    According to Shalott, the chocobo's mother is from the stables in Bastok.
    How I wish I could go there to see her for myself...${prompt}
  8648: |-
    What can I do for you?
    If you want to ride a chocobo, one of the girls over there can help you out.${prompt}
  8649: Lately, a lot of adventurers seem to be forgetting that a chocobo is an animal, not an object.${prompt}
  8650: |-
    You should keep that in mind as you're enjoying that easy ride through monster-ridden badlands.
    Have a safe journey.${prompt}
  8651: A chocobo with silver-colored feathers...?${prompt}
  8652: Ah, you'd be talking about Silver Comet.${prompt}
  8653: She used to be the mount of a highly ranked general in the Bastokan navy.${prompt}
  8654: The general's son received the chocobo as a coming-of-age present, which he promptly took advantage of to leave Bastok.${prompt}
  8655: For the longest time, no one saw hide nor hair of man or beast--until eventually, Silver Comet came wandering back into town...alone.${prompt}
  8656: I heard later on that the general's son had lost his life somewhere in the wilds.${prompt}
  8657: Only Silver Comet had managed to return unharmed.${prompt}
  8658: In memory of his son, the general asked us to take the chocobo into our care...${prompt}
  8659: |-
    But then one day, Silver Comet was gone.
    Some chocobo thief had stolen her.${prompt}
  8660: |-
    Hm?
    You say a chick of Silver Comet's is being kept in the Jeuno stables?
    You must be mistaken.${prompt}
  8661: Anyway, after the theft, the general exhausted every avenue in search of his son's chocobo.${prompt}
  8662: He eventually found an adventurer who allegedly saw a chocobo drowning in the Pashhow Marshlands.${prompt}
  8663: That chocobo had the same markings as Silver Comet.${prompt}
  8664: If you want to try talking to that adventurer, you should go to the outpost in the marshlands.${prompt}
  8665: |-
    He's given up the adventuring life, it seems.
    Now he earns his daily bread by seeing to the needs of the soldiers at the outpost.${prompt}
  8666: The gate is locked.${prompt}
  8667: |-
    Whaddaya want?
    I got no time for adventurers.${prompt}
  8668: |-
    Huh? Where'd you hear...
    Well, whatever.${prompt}
  8669: You say you got business with me?${prompt}
  8670: |-
    Silver Comet...
    What the hell are you bothering me about that old chocobo story for?
    You some kind of crackpot?${prompt}
  8671: Leave me alone, you loon.${prompt}
  8672: "Can't you see I'm busy? \nThis place gets too wet and too dark too quick to be wasting time chatting.${prompt}"
  8673: |-
    Hold up a minute.
    If you bring me some ${item-plural: 1[2]}, I might be willing to give you the time of day.${prompt}
  8674: |-
    Yep, three of those ought to do it.
    I'll give you until the day after tomorrow.${prompt}
  8675: |-
    You brought what I asked for?
    Careful with that stuff, it's powerful smelly.${prompt}
  8676: |-
    It's good for hiding a person's scent, you see.
    Helps me get around.${prompt}
  8677: |-
    Now, then.
    You wanted to hear about that chocobo, right?${prompt}
  8678: |-
    She was one of the fastest chocobos I've ever ridden, but damn near uncontrollable.
    I don't know how Silver Comet's owner handled her.${prompt}
  8679: |-
    I guess the death of her former owner is what sent her off the edge.
    That chocobo wasn't right in the head.${prompt}
  8680: |-
    She threw herself headlong into the marshes.
    Thought my number was up, I can tell you!
  8681: When I saw her in the stables, she was wearing a collar attached to a chain.${prompt}
  8682: That wasn't to keep the general's mount from being stolen--it was to keep Silver Comet from flying the coop, so to speak.${prompt}
  8683: |-
    That general's a real schemer.
    Said that if Silver Comet was released, she would be able to find Shooting Star.${prompt}
  8684: It's his fault I almost got killed!${prompt}
  8685: |-
    Huh?
    Who's Shooting Star? He's a chocobo, too.${prompt}
  8686: Shooting Star was Silver Comet's mate.${prompt}
  8687: Their love was a pure, uncomplicated thing, much more so than what people feel.${prompt}
  8688: |-
    Ahahaha!
    I think this oil is starting to muddle my senses.
    I'll see you around, adventurer.${prompt}
  8689: Were you able to meet with that adventurer?${prompt}
  8690: |-
    ...Is that right?
    I think you were around that ${item-singular: 1[2]} a bit too long.${prompt}
  8691: It sounds to me like that adventurer was the one who stole Silver Comet in the first place.${prompt}
  8692: Or at least you would think so, if the thief wasn't supposed to have drowned in the marsh as well.${prompt}
  8693: |-
    You mentioned a “Shooting Star”?
    I know that name.${prompt}
  8694: |-
    That chocobo was raised alongside Silver Comet.
    Those two were almost inseparable as chicks.${prompt}
  8695: Unfortunately, unlike Silver Comet's case, Shooting Star died saving his master.${prompt}
  8696: |-
    I'm guessing Silver Comet was trying to find him when she jumped into that marsh.
    The general mentioned something similar at the time, I recall.${prompt}
  8697: |-
    Hm?
    Still trying to convince me that her chick is in Jeuno?${prompt}
  8698: |-
    I'm sorry, but I really think you're mistaken.
    I mean, the general even had Silver Comet's collar.${prompt}
  8699: He said he was going to lay it on his son's grave in Batallia Downs.${prompt}
  8700: |-
    But, wait.
    I seem to remember that collar being sent by a man named Brutus.
    He runs a chocobo stable in Jeuno...${prompt}
  8701: Why would the collar be sent from Jeuno when Silver Comet drowned in the Pashhow Marshlands?${prompt}
  8702: You are being attacked!${prompt}
  8703: Now is not the time for that!${prompt}
  8704: You sense something is not quite right...${prompt}
  8705: You find nothing.${prompt}
  8706: I...I don't know what you're talking about.${prompt}
  8707: |-
    Wow...
    So this collar belonged to that chocobo's mother, Silver Comet?${prompt}
  8708: I would place this on the grave of her mate, Shooting Star, if I only knew where it was.${prompt}
  8709: So you're the two snoopers who were asking Shalott about Silver Comet.${prompt}
  8710: That collar...!?${prompt}
  8711: |-
    You've dug pretty far into this old story.
    Looks like after twenty years, people start to let things slip.${prompt}
  8712: Please don't be angry, Brutus.${prompt}
  8713: I found out that chocobos can fall in love, just like people do.${prompt}
  8714: There was a girl who taught me that animals and people are the same.${prompt}
  8715: I think the story of Silver Comet and Shooting Star helped me to really understand what she meant.${prompt}
  8716: Well then, I suppose I'll have to tell you the whole tale.${prompt}
  8717: Silver Comet and Shooting Star never really died.${prompt}
  8718: Really!?${prompt}
  8719: Shooting Star was a special chocobo that was attacked by an evil man.${prompt}
  8720: He was badly wounded when they brought him here, and we all worked hard to get him back on his feet.${prompt}
  8721: But Shooting Star was still being chased by the evil man, so we had to hide him away.${prompt}
  8722: We took him to a place in the west of Batallia Downs, where that villain would never find him.${prompt}
  8723: But the bad man was clever. He knew that if he had Silver Comet, her bond to Shooting Star would lead them right to the chocobo's hiding place.${prompt}
  8724: Silver Comet was one smart chocobo, though.${prompt}
  8725: She deliberately dove into the marshes to force the villain from her back.${prompt}
  8726: It was an extremely dangerous thing for Silver Comet to do.${prompt}
  8727: |-
    But she never gave up.
    She had to protect her mate from the man who meant to hurt him.${prompt}
  8728: |-
    Silver Comet swam through the muck and dragged herself free of the marshlands.
    She was finally able to make it to Shooting Star's side.${prompt}
  8729: That's when I took off her collar and set her free.${prompt}
  8730: What happened to them after that?${prompt}
  8731: Did they live happily ever after?${prompt}
  8732: |-
    That's right.
    And the youngest of the brood they raised together is that chocobo right over there.${prompt}
  8733: What a great story...${prompt}
  8734: |-
    It's not over yet.
    The villain of this tale is still lurking around somewhere.${prompt}
  8735: "That's why you can never tell anybody what you've heard here today. \nYou want to keep that chocobo safe, right?${prompt}"
  8736: Right!${prompt}
  8737: I'll never tell, I promise!${prompt}
  8738: |-
    Glad to hear it.
    And one more thing...${prompt}
  8739: Don't forget how Silver Comet never gave up on her mate.${prompt}
  8740: Even when those they love and believe in have gone, animals will keep on striving.${prompt}
  8741: |-
    Right.
    That's because animals come from the same source as people.${prompt}
  8742: |-
    Adventurer, you can have this.
    Keep this story to yourself.${prompt}
  8743: |-
    Thank you so much!
    And this is from me.${prompt}
  8744: I wonder if that Elvaan girl knows how Silver Comet and Shooting Star were married.${prompt}
  8745: I would like to meet her again some day...${prompt}
  8746: Press any button to continue.${prompt}
  8747: At the request of a certain society, I am investigating the effects of the dreaded “Emptiness” on living beings.${prompt}
  8748: |-
    You appear to be a well-traveled adventurer.
    Perhaps you have seen one of the Emptiness-ravaged creatures of which I speak?${prompt}
  8749: We have labeled these monstrosities “Empty Notorious Monsters,” or ENMs...${prompt}
  8750: |-
    Have you seen one?
    ${selection-lines}
    Indeed I have.
    I'm not quite sure...${prompt}
  8751: |-
    Aha, so you have firsthand experience.
    You probably don't need a scholar's explanation, but please indulge me...${prompt}
  8752: The material presence of ENMs has become temporary and insubstantial, meaning that those who have witnessed a particular ENM's existence are unable to encounter it again until a period of time has passed.${prompt}
  8753: |-
    My research has allowed me to measure the length of time between ENM manifestations.
    Tell me, which ENM would you like to know about?${prompt}
  8754: |-
    I wish to know about the ENM in...
    ${selection-lines}
    Nowhere in particular.
    The Spire of Holla.
    The Spire of Dem.
    The Spire of Mea.
    The Spire of Vahzl.
    Monarch Linn.
    The Shrouded Maw.
    Mine Shaft #2716.
    Bearclaw Pinnacle.
    Boneyard Gully.${prompt}
  8755: 'You won''t be able to encounter that particular ENM until ${vanatime: 1} (${earthtime: 1} Earth time).${prompt}'
  8756: The ENM in that area should be sufficiently manifest for your next encounter.${prompt}
  8757: |-
    You have no need of my expertise at the moment?
    Very well.${prompt}
  8758: And now we come to the crux of the matter...${prompt}
  8759: If there is an ENM that you are currently able to locate, I strongly urge you to take action.${prompt}
  8760: |-
    These...creatures...are no longer natural beings of Vana'diel.
    They must be destroyed.${prompt}
  8761: Je ne peux pas entrer dans les détails, mais sachez que le sort du monde dépend de l'élimination rapide de cette menace...${prompt}
  8762: Alors peut-être vaut-il mieux oublier cette conversation entièrement.${prompt}
  8763: J'espère vous avoir été d'une quelconque aide.${prompt}
  8764: |-
    Ce sombre fléau devient de plus en plus puissant...
    S'il n'est pas arrêté rapidement...${prompt}

    ${name-player} !
    Le navire de Dame Esha'ntarl est de retour.${prompt}
  8767: |-
    C'est un excellent moment.
    J'ai reçu l'ordre de vous trouver et de vous demander de vous rendre au Pont de Marbre--la taverne à Upper Jeuno.${prompt}
  8768: |-
    Mon devoir ici est accompli.
    Je dois maintenant voyager vers chaque nation et rapporter que le Roi Dragon Bahamut ne représente plus une menace.${prompt}
  8769: |-
    J'entends dire que ce développement est entièrement grâce à vous et vos compagnons.
    Vous avez la gratitude de tous les Junois.${prompt}
  8770: |-
    J'attendais votre retour, ${name-player}.
    Vous devez me raconter tout ce qui s'est passé.${prompt}
  8771: After clashing with our army several times, the dragons suddenly broke off their attack and disappeared into the distant clouds.${prompt}
  8772: There were voices raised in support of hunting the wyrms into extinction, but for the moment we have returned to resupply and reconsider our position.${prompt}
  8773: Now that you are here, I can finally be certain.${prompt}
  8774: Am I to assume from your jubilant features that the Keeper of the Apocalypse has been defeated?${prompt}
  8775: |-
    Has the keeper been defeated?
    ${selection-lines}
    Completely.
    Who can say?${prompt}
  8776: |-
    I knew it!
    Bahamut sensed the keeper's downfall and pulled his forces out of battle...${prompt}
  8777: |-
    Tell me.
    What momentous events transpired in the Celestial Capital?${prompt}
  8778: On Cape Riverne, the images that flowed into me from Selh'teus...${prompt}
  8779: They were of the incomplete Paradise, Al'Taieu...${prompt}
  8780: |-
    The people of Al'Taieu returned to their deity ten thousand years ago.
    Returned to Promathia...${prompt}
  8781: |-
    “Opening the Gates of Paradise” is a metaphor for restoring the shattered mothercrystal.
    A way to return the world to its original state.${prompt}
  8782: |-
    The world becomes a paradise, and its people ascend to godhood.
    The Dawnmaiden Yve'noile has memories of witnessing the true form of the great goddess Altana.${prompt}
  8783: Yve'noile spoke to me before we parted ways.${prompt}
  8784: She said, “As I gazed upon her perfection, I realized I could not be a part of her. I wondered who I could possibly be.”${prompt}
  8785: That was when she began her research into the race of people.${prompt}
  8786: After shifting her focus to the inexplicable appearance of the Kuluu phenomenon, Yve'noile became aware of the darkness that resided within us all.${prompt}
  8787: Her realization led her to betray the king and his son, and adamantly oppose any plan to open the Gates of Paradise.${prompt}
  8788: She had discovered our origins as the children of Promathia...${prompt}
  8789: But all has not been resolved.${prompt}
  8790: The Emptiness still seethes within the mothercrystals.${prompt}
  8791: And the surviving Zilart yet cling desperately to their shadowy plan of returning to Paradise.${prompt}
  8792: I gave up my life in Tavnazia almost thirty years ago to infiltrate the organization of the newly awakened Zilart.${prompt}
  8793: But I have been unable to stem their vast power on my own.${prompt}
  8794: However, we now have a common enemy in the Emptiness. For a time, the people of this age will require the aid of the ancients.${prompt}
  8795: The ancients, too, will need your continuing help.${prompt}
  8796: Surely the Dawn Maiden has bequeathed something of value to her younger kin.${prompt}
  8797: I will find out what this may be, and speak with Archduke Kam'lanaut. He will heed my words.${prompt}
  8798: I shall continue to watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.${prompt}
  8799: Now that Nag'molada is gone and the wyrms have ceased their attacks, it is time to remind the Zilart of their true responsibility:${prompt}
  8800: The safety of the mothercrystals and the battle against the Emptiness.${prompt}
  8801: I will continue to monitor their actions as I watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.${prompt}
  8802: There is one thing I'd like you to keep in mind, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8803: You were able to save the world and her people without sacrificing one or the other.${prompt}
  8804: But do not misunderstand.${prompt}
  8805: This possibility did not always exist.${prompt}
  8806: It was only with the strength and faith of many people that such a path could open before you.${prompt}
  8807: |-
    I have left with the owner of this tavern three rewards that may help you on your adventures.
    Feel free to choose one.${prompt}
  8808: Until our paths cross once more, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8809: Thank you, and farewell.${prompt}
  8810: |-
    There're so many people in this town.
    It takes me by surprrrise no matter how many times I come here.${prompt}
  8811: |-
    All this activity makes it difficult to get anything done.
    It's enough to make my whiskers curl.${prompt}
  8812: |-
    I don't think you'd be able to help me out, though.
    Why don't you rrrun along?${prompt}
  8813: |-
    Hey, you there.
    You wouldn't happen to have a little time up your sleeve, would you?${prompt}
  8814: I'm looking for some assistance, you see.${prompt}
  8815: |-
    I have to find out if these people are carrying a certain type of mirror.
    Look at the size of this list! Have you ever seen so many names!?${prompt}

    Help out?

    That's a shame...
    There's a rrreward involved, so let me know if you change your mind, or if your schedule frrrees up, okay?${prompt}
  8821: |-
    Take a look at this list.
    I want you to choose one person and see what information you can dig up on them.
    Do you think you can handle that?${prompt}
  8822: |-
    Rrridiculously long, isn't it?
    And this list is only for Jeuno.

    Yes. One of the mirrors was being kept in the Empire of Aht Urhgan, but was eventually lost to the world.
    Or so the tale goes...${prompt}
  9820: It was once stored within a small chest and strrrictly guarded, with only selected people permitted to view the mirror itself.${prompt}
  9821: This looking glass supposedly emitted a light of such heart-stopping beauty, it was almost blinding.${prompt}
  9822: This light was so dazzling, it spilled from the chest and soothed the souls of all who gazed upon it.${prompt}
  9823: And so we can deduce from these properties that the mirror lost to the Aht Urhgan Empire was most likely the Glass of Blessed Radiance.${prompt}
  9824: If this mirror still exists somewhere in the world, I would do anything to track it down!${prompt}
  9825: I'm a sucker for beautiful artifacts. And this tale of divine rrradiance makes me want it even more!${prompt}
  9826: '...This book appears to be of considerable age. You did well to discover such a valuable resource.${prompt}'
  9827: Let's see what it has to say.${prompt}
  9828: “Worshipped in the Near East, there is a small mirror whose creation was ordered by a king, now long deceased.”${prompt}
  9829: “As time passed, the looking glass came to be revered as a holy object, and even while it was kept under guard...”${prompt}
  9830: “...people began to call it the Mirror of Blighted Gloom.”${prompt}
  9831: “The blackened metal of the mirror emits a dim, dark light that conjures images of early evening.”${prompt}
  9832: Hmmm...${prompt}
  9833: |-
    That would suggest to me that the brrroken glass I have now is this Mirror of Blighted Gloom.
    The description fits perfectly.${prompt}
  9834: The explanation continues...${prompt}
  9835: “This metal is like no other substance we have ever encountered.”${prompt}
  9836: “Expert scientists concur that while this substance gives off a metallic glint...”${prompt}
  9837: “...it has a malleable structure at room temperature almost like a liquid. However, for reasons unknown, it is able to maintain its shape.”${prompt}
  9838: “The metal used by the creators of the mirror no longer exists, and as such, it would be impossible to duplicate its creation today.”${prompt}
  9839: |-
    No longer exists...!
    Then how am I supposed to...?${prompt}

  9852: It continues...${prompt}
  9853: “However, the method for crafting the mirror has been discovered and follows these steps:”${prompt}
  9854: “One. Prepare the metal that is to become the body of the mirror.”${prompt}
  9855: “Two. Find a spring with a surface as smooth as glass. The spring must be filled with clear water.”${prompt}
  9856: |-
    “Three. Chant the charm, and offer a prayer.
    The charm is only known by the guardians of the mirror...”${prompt}
  9857: “If the above steps are followed correctly, an enchanted mirror will be created.”${prompt}
  9858: |-

  10885: There is a reason why I am here. Allow me to explain...${prompt}
  10886: An interesting idea was proposed at the last Conquest Evaluation Assembly...${prompt}
  10887: '...And so it seems that the adventurers are using their own unique set of rules for Ballista.${prompt}'
  10888: There is also the remarkable news that the most capable adventurers in the world came together for a tournament that encompassed the greater part of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  10889: Ballista has been taken out of our hands and placed into those of the adventurers.${prompt}
  10890: I agree. The Ballista participants have forced us to recall the true meaning of the word “hero.”${prompt}
  10891: The revival of Ballista has raised morale and restored public order. I suppose we have achieved our original goals.${prompt}
  10892: '...We have, have we?${prompt}'
  10893: It certainly sounds like someone's a mite bitter...${prompt}

  10897: |-
    Stop quarreling! It is my fault for mumbling to myself.
    Please listen to what I have to say.${prompt}
  10898: I agree that the San d'Orian Royal Knights are endowed with sound, quick decision-making abilities and deserve admiration.${prompt}
  10899: The deeds of a single hero are capable of setting afire the hearts of many a soldier. We must not neglect the power of motivation in leading an army to victory.${prompt}
  10900: Even so, soldiers must be able to follow their commander's orders and fulfill their given roles. Arbitrary decisions can lead an entire army to its doom.${prompt}
  10901: Thus, I am of the opinion that observing Ballista matches in their current state may not be a beneficial practice for our armies.${prompt}
  10902: |-
    Your remarks are inexcusable!
    How dare you denounce a San d'Orian tradition! I suggest you reconsider your statements.${prompt}
  10903: |-
    I apologize.
    I must admit that Ballista has noticeably improved the skills of many an adventurer and educated our soldiers on the importance of courage.${prompt}
  10904: However, the reality is that our armies are divided into several units, each with its own role. The soldiers must be able to coordinate themselves effectively and behave as a whole. I believe that a new form of Conflict that trains participants to work in a group would be most rewarding.${prompt}
  10905: |-
    Harumph, do we look like children to you?
    You could have cut that explanation in half and it would have been more than sufficientaru!${prompt}
  10906: All right then. I'll get straight to the point now.${prompt}
  10907: |-
    Oh, give us a break!
    What point could you make?
    All your vague statements and whatnot!
    Why not lend an ear to what I've got?${prompt}
  10908: |-
    No thanks...
    Well then, I shall be frank.${prompt}
  10909: I propose the reinstatement of “Brenner” as a new form of Conflict!${prompt}
  10910: Brenner!?${prompt}
  10911: |-
    I remember that name. Before the Great War, Brenner was used in the selection of the Gold Musketeers.
    However, the competition was extraordinarily fierce, and it is said that the casualties always exceeded the number of successful candidates.${prompt}
  10912: Those stories were fabricated simply to exaggerate the danger of Brenner.${prompt}
  10913: |-
    Brenner was originally created as a training exercise for mineworkers.
    The outcome of each match relied on the participants' skill in role management and encouraged team competition.${prompt}
  10914: Of course, I am not suggesting that we abolish Ballista. I simply advise that we add Brenner to the list of training options in order to supply the elements of teamwork that I find lacking in current matches.${prompt}
  10915: |-
    Hmph, so you wish to fortify your army by tying them tightly together in iron bonds.
    How very-wery Bastokan!${prompt}
  10916: |-
    Ohohoho!
    Still, the idea makes my heart race!
    I even support it. You make a good case!${prompt}
  10917: |-
    Ohohoho!
    So if your weaklings unite,
    you think you can win any fight?${prompt}
  10918: |-
    Oho, this is rich!
    May your plan go without hitch!${prompt}
  10919: |-
    I will support your plan, but please be aware
    that against the black mages, no one's got a prayer!${prompt}
  10920: |-
    If it will supplement Ballista, I believe that even Excenmille would have no argument.
    You have my approval.${prompt}
  10921: |-
    I appreciate your decision.
    Now I also would like to suggest that we do away with the license requirement and nationality restrictions for Brenner.${prompt}
  10922: |-
    Quite a bold statement.
    However, teams would be composed of complete strangers if we enforce what you propose. Is that your desire?${prompt}
  10923: The adventurers have taught me much, but one of the greatest lessons I have learned is the strength of the bond between linkshell members.${prompt}
  10924: Linkshells provide an exemplary model of unity. The cooperation and friendly competition of these groups are like those of the closest companions or even family. And thus, I propose that we introduce matches divided by linkshell rather than nation.${prompt}
  10925: |-
    Interesting. You seem to have worked out these plans more thoroughly than I expected.
    Have you also given consideration to where the matches will be held?${prompt}
  10926: |-
    Of course.
    Wolfgang, shall we invite our guest in now?${prompt}
  10927: A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am called Afdeen.${prompt}
  10928: I have come to your lands by order of the great Abdhaljs.${prompt}
  10929: |-
    By Altana!
    Do you mean to suggest that you are a direct disciple of Sir Abdhaljs? I believe I have heard your name before.${prompt}
  10930: |-
    Is your master in good health?
    He deserves our gratitude for the Diorama...${prompt}
  10931: Yes, he is quite well. However, he desires no reward. He is quite pleased with the Ballista matches that take place each day in the Diorama.${prompt}
  10932: On another note, he has expressed interest in a new form of Conflict. He has entrusted me with matters regarding his new diorama, which is designed after Purgonorgo Isle.${prompt}
  10933: The great Abdhaljs has created a new diorama specifically for this new form of Conflict? Magnificent! You will hear no argument from me.${prompt}
  10934: That's dandy-wandy, but don't forget that Windurst won't lend a single gil to the project!${prompt}
  10935: |-
    Well, there you have it. The preparations sound fine!
    Okay then, inform me when Windurst is next in line!${prompt}
  10936: The reinstatement of Brenner has now been approved!${prompt}
  10937: I will send a detailed explanation of the rules to each of you. If you should have any objections, please take them up with Sir Wolfgang.${prompt}
  10938: Obviously, the citizens of Windurst have the closestaru bond. Our adventurers will have to teach the rest of you a thing or two about teamwork now.${prompt}
  10939: |-
    I am simply beside myself--my prayers will not cease!
    Wishing your people get through this in one piece!

    I will not stand for these meaningless insults against the Royal Knights!
    Our records in Ballista prove our prowess in working as a team.${prompt}
  10941: I think it is time to call this meeting to a close. Thank you all for your participation.${prompt}
  10942: How can any idea be interesting when Bastok thoughtaru of it first?${prompt}
  10943: |-
    You're missing the point--this'll make them prepared
    for the time that they're needed, my plans unimpaired!${prompt}
  10944: Your plans? You can't mean...${prompt}
  10945: |-
    Now to just wait and see
    what Brenner will bring to me!${prompt}
  10946: |-
    I'll need many a strong adventurer
    for my grand plans, that's for sure!
    Ohohoho!${prompt}
  10947: |-
    Sending Ajido-Marujido to the assembly had results most intriguing.

  11418: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  11419: “Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt}
  11420: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  11421: “Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt}
  11422: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  11423: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  11424: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  11425: “Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt}
  11426: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  11427: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}
  11428: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt}

  11435: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt}
  11436: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt}
  11437: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt}
  11438: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt}
  11439: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  11440: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  11441: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  11442: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  11443: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  11444: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  11445: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11446: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt}
  11447: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11448: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  11449: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  11450: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11451: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  11452: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  11453: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11454: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  11455: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt}
  11456: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}
  11457: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt}
  11458: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  11459: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  11460: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt}
  11461: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt}
  11462: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  11463: You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.${prompt}

  11466: In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  11467: Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt}
  11468: On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt}
  11469: However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt}
  11470: You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  11471: Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt}

  11473: I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt}
  11474: Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt}
  11475: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt}
  11476: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt}
  11477: You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt}
  11478: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt}

  11481: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt}
  11482: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt}
  11483: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  11484: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  11485: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}
  11486: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt}
  11487: 'Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt}'

  11489: 'Chocobos also seem to enjoy ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  11490: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt}
  11491: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt}
  11492: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt}'
  11493: 'In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It''s a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt}'

  11496: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  11497: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  11498: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'
  11499: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt}
  11500: 'The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt}'
  11501: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  11502: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo''s energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt}'
  11503: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt}'
  11504: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt}
  11505: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}
  11506: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt}

    Abilities.

    Weather preferences.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  11509: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  11510: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  11511: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  11512: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  11513: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  11514: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  11515: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  11516: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  11517: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  11518: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}
  11519: 'When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  11520: 'You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  11521: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt}
  11522: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt}
  11523: 'You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}'
  11524: 'You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11525: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt}
  11526: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11527: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  11528: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt}
  11529: 'When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  11530: 'Also, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}''s power will grow weak after you''ve used it several times.${prompt}'

  11535: If you lose it, you won't be able to get another one, so keep it in a safe place!${prompt}
  11536: 'You can use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.${prompt}'
  11537: The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.${prompt}
  11538: 'Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, so good luck with that...${prompt}'
  11539: Chococards are documents that contain all the details about a chocobo's attributes and condition. They are divided into two types--one for each gender.${prompt}
  11540: If you trade one to the person who's in charge of matchmaking, he'll introduce your animal to another chocobo.${prompt}
  11541: Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.${prompt}

  11838: Maintenant, avant de commencer ton entraînement, laisse-moi te raconter un peu l'origine de notre danse.${prompt}
  11839: C'est un style martial basé sur le "Kriegstanz" traditionnel bastokien -- une danse utilisée lors des batailles réelles.${prompt}
  11840: Bien sûr, nous avons appris à adapter ce style martial en une forme adaptée aux performances.${prompt}
  11841: Mais d'abord, tu devras travailler les mouvements de base, martiaux.${prompt}

    Rhea !
    Montre à ce rookie comment faire !${prompt}

    Ne reste pas là à traîner des pieds !
    Je m'attends à ce que tu passes chaque moment libre à pratiquer ces mouvements !
    La Troupe Brilioth n'accepte que les meilleurs !${prompt}

  11846: |-
    La danse s'apprend en la pratiquant, pas en la regardant.
    Bouge ton corps et danse jusqu'à ce que tu tombes !${prompt}
  11847: |-
    Qu'est-ce que tu regardes ?
    Je ne distribue pas d'autographes.${prompt}
  11848: 'Je suis content que tu aies rejoint notre petit groupe, mais sois averti : le travail difficile ne fait que commencer !${prompt}'

    Elles sont tellement belles !
    J'aimerais aussi devenir danseuse un jour !${prompt}
  11850: Deux jeunes filles sur le champ de bataille... et un Galka ?${prompt}
  11851: Il y a beaucoup de "danseurs", mais seuls quelques-uns sont vraiment brillants.${prompt}
  11852: |-
    Et parmi ces brillants élus, on dit que le plus talentueux et gracieux est visité par la Divinité de la Danse.
    Cela pourrait-il être vrai ?${prompt}
  11853: J'ai beaucoup appris sur la Guerre du Cristal en m'occupant d'Ilumida.${prompt}
  11854: Elle m'a même parlé de ces horribles statues que les gens appellent "les gouffres".${prompt}
  11855: Je n'ai pas vécu cette expérience moi-même, mais on dit que rien que la vue de ces idoles ravive les souvenirs les plus horribles de la guerre...${prompt}
  11856: |-
    Je me demande s'il existe d'autres choses dans le monde qui rappellent aux gens cette époque horrible.
    Si seulement de telles atrocités pouvaient être enterrées pour toujours.${prompt}
  11857: Est-ce que les bêtes ont aussi un dieu à qui elles prient, de la même manière que nous demandons les bénédictions d'Altana ?${prompt}
  11858: |-
    Bien que je ne sois pas sûr de vouloir savoir quelles prières tordues les bêtes pourraient faire.
    Et toi ?${prompt}

  11860: Pourquoi tu ne me montres pas quelques-uns de tes mouvements ? Allez, laisse-moi voir.${prompt}
  11861: Hmmm... des pas nets, confiants, et un excellent équilibre du haut du corps en prime. Sans aucun doute, tu t'es amélioré.${prompt}
  11862: On dirait que tu as fidèlement répété les bases de notre style martial, le “Kriegstanz”.${prompt}
  11863: Mais ta danse manque encore d'un certain... "éclat".${prompt}
  11864: Écoute bien. Ce que la Troupe Brilioth cherche, c'est un style de danse qui captive et envoûte.${prompt}
  11865: Je veux que tu réfléchisses à comment tu pourrais faire briller ta danse.${prompt}
  11866: Ce que la Troupe Brilioth cherche, c'est un style de danse qui captive et envoûte.${prompt}
  11867: Quoi ? Tu veux savoir ce qui manque dans ta danse ?${prompt}
  11868: C'est une question difficile... Personnellement, je crois que tu t'es énormément amélioré.${prompt}
  11869: Laila m'a un jour parlé de son enfance. Le Witchfire Glen, à Grauberg, était l'endroit où sa mère lui apprenait à danser. Elle disait que c'était là qu'elle avait appris l'essence véritable de la danse.${prompt}
  11870: Pendant la Grande Guerre, on disait que le Witchfire Glen était un lieu mystique, où des fées pouvaient être vues en train de gambader.${prompt}
  11871: La mère de Laila ne sélectionnait que les danseurs les plus talentueux, et les formait là-bas. J'aurais adoré faire partie de ces leçons !${prompt}
  11872: Désolé de ne pas avoir pu t'aider à pimenter tes pas...${prompt}
  11873: La mère de Laila ne sélectionnait que les danseurs les plus talentueux, et les formait au Witchfire Glen, à Grauberg.${prompt}
  11874: Alors, ${name-player}. As-tu trouvé comment faire briller ta danse ?${prompt}
  11875: Tu penses avoir ce qu'il faut maintenant ? Allez, montre-nous un peu.${prompt}
  11876: Eh bien, eh bien, c'était quelque chose.${prompt}
  11877: |-
    “Une danse magistrale peut être l'arme la plus létale ; un combat habile, la danse la plus élégante.”
    Ce sont les mots de ma chère mère.${prompt}
  11878: Mais il y a une différence essentielle entre danser sur scène, et danser au combat.${prompt}
  11879: Sur scène, tu danses devant un public, dans le but de leur apporter un sourire.${prompt}
  11880: Ton désir de divertir et de plaire au public est ce qui fait briller ta danse. N'oublie pas ça.${prompt}
  11881: Laila ! Je viens de rencontrer Wyatt, le gars qui gère une entreprise de promotion de troupes de performance...${prompt}
  11882: Il m'a dit que la Troupe Valeriano est la prochaine à se produire ici, à Jeuno.${prompt}
  11883: La Troupe Valeriano... à Jeuno !?${prompt}
  11884: Apparemment, le chef de la troupe veut venir te parler quand ils arriveront.${prompt}
  11885: Quel genre d'affaire une troupe comme Valeriano pourrait-elle bien avoir avec moi ?${prompt}
  11886: '...${prompt}'
  11887: Hé hé, ça suffit les rêveries ! Retourne à tes répétitions !${prompt}
  11888: Je ne tolérerai pas que tu te ridiculises devant la Troupe Valeriano !${prompt}
  11889: Je me demande pourquoi elle est devenue si grincheuse tout à coup.${prompt}
  11890: Il y a à peine un instant, elle chantait tes louanges, ${name-player}, et elle m'a même demandé de préparer quelque chose pour toi.${prompt}
  11891: Je ne pensais pas que la nouvelle la contrarierait autant... Pas de nouvelles, bonnes nouvelles, hein ?${prompt}
  11892: Assez de rêveries ! ${name-player}, je veux voir plus de “brillance” dans cette danse !${prompt}
  11893: Je me demande pourquoi elle est devenue si grincheuse tout à coup...${prompt}
  11894: Tu répètes dur, ${name-player} ?${prompt}
  11895: Montre-moi tes progrès de temps en temps, hein ?${prompt}
  11896: Hmmm...${prompt}
  11897: Pas mal, mais tu as encore du chemin à faire si tu veux devenir la diva de la troupe de danse.${prompt}
  11898: As-tu déjà dansé sur la musique d'un musicien ?${prompt}
  11899: Sur scène, un danseur doit être en harmonie avec les musiciens qui jouent l'accompagnement.${prompt}
  11900: Même quand tu répètes, tu dois visualiser la musique dans ta tête, sinon tu deviendras un danseur égocentrique.${prompt}
  11901: Et je te garantis que les danseurs égocentriques ne vont pas très loin.${prompt}
  11902: Pour devenir un danseur de haut niveau, tu dois travailler avec un musicien de haut niveau. Je te conseille de trouver un bon musicien qui jouera une mélodie pour que tu danses.${prompt}
  11903: Laisse-moi te raconter une histoire. Quand j'étais petite, une fois j'ai sauté une répétition et me suis faufilée vers un lac dans la forêt de Jugner. C'est là que mes oreilles ont été envoûtées par une mélodie de pipe merveilleuse. Sa mélodie envoûtante est encore vive dans mon esprit à ce jour.${prompt}
  11904: Même si je n'ai jamais vu la personne qui jouait, cette rencontre fortuite m'a fait devenir la danseuse que je suis aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  11905: Si seulement je savais qui jouait cette mélodie, je pourrais partager son inspiration avec toi, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11906: |-
    <Soupir> 
    C'était il y a tellement longtemps...${prompt}
  11907: Si tu veux devenir une danseuse de premier plan, tu ferais bien de trouver un musicien de premier plan avec qui travailler.${prompt}
  11908: J'aimerais pouvoir rencontrer un musicien splendide qui saurait jouer sur mes cordes sensibles.${prompt}
  11909: Tu dis que tu as rencontré un barde qui a joué une mélodie pour que tu danses ?${prompt}
  11910: Eh bien, voyons voir comment tu t'es améliorée.${prompt}
  11911: '...!${prompt}'
  11912: C-c'était incroyable !${prompt}
  11913: Ce barde que tu as rencontré devait vraiment être quelque chose.${prompt}
  11914: Il est grand temps que tu reçoives ceci.${prompt}
  11915: Tu as fait du chemin, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11916: 'Honnêtement, le jour où tu as apporté le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} et que j’ai dû t’accepter dans la Troupe Brilioth, je ne savais pas comment tu allais tourner.${prompt}'
  11917: Mais tu as dépassé toutes les attentes.${prompt}
  11918: Oui, c'est dommage, mais la pierre que tu as apportée a perdu son éclat.${prompt}
  11919: La même chose est arrivée à la pierre que j'ai avec moi depuis des années. Vois-tu ?${prompt}
  11920: Quoi...!?${prompt}
  11921: Excusez-moi, mais vous êtes la Troupe Brilioth, n'est-ce pas ? C'est un honneur de vous rencontrer.${prompt}
  11922: V-Valeriano !${prompt}
  11923: Quoi ? C'est vraiment... Laila ? C'est bien toi, n'est-ce pas !${prompt}
  11924: Vous vous connaissez, Laila ?${prompt}
  11925: N-non...${prompt}
  11926: Tu ne te souviens pas ? Il y a dix ans... tu es venue me voir en voulant rejoindre la Troupe Valeriano.${prompt}
  11927: Impossible !!!${prompt}
  11928: C'est vrai, Laila ?${prompt}
  11929: |-
    <Soupir> 
    Je suppose qu'il n'y a pas de raison de le cacher...${prompt}
  11930: Mon, mon, quelle danseuse splendide tu es devenue ! Quand j'ai entendu la nouvelle de Wyatt à propos de la prometteuse nouvelle troupe de danse, j'ai eu un pressentiment que tu en serais la responsable, Laila.${prompt}
  11931: Et une si belle troupe de danse sous tes ailes ! Maintenant, je suis certain que c'était la bonne décision de te refuser il y a dix ans.${prompt}
  11932: J'attendais avec impatience de te voir danser à nouveau, Laila. Je te verrai bientôt sur scène !${prompt}
  11933: Laila... Ce qu'il vient de dire...${prompt}
  11934: Tout ça est vrai, Rhea.${prompt}
  11935: Sauf une chose... Il ne m'a jamais, jamais vue danser. Comment peut-il attendre de me voir « à nouveau » danser s'il ne m'a même jamais vue... ne serait-ce qu'une fois ?${prompt}
  11936: Quelle horreur !${prompt}
  11937: Il y a dix ans, ma mère a monté une grande production de danse, et j'ai été choisie pour le rôle principal.${prompt}
  11938: C'était le moment le plus fier de ma vie. C'était d'autant plus spécial que Maman était une professeure stricte qui ne faisait aucun privilège à personne, pas même à sa propre fille.${prompt}
  11939: Peu de temps après mes débuts en tant que tête d'affiche, la Troupe Valeriano est arrivée en ville.${prompt}
  11940: À l'époque déjà, la Troupe Valeriano était un cirque d'envergure, avec des musiciens ainsi que des danseurs dans son répertoire.${prompt}
  11941: Leurs performances étaient un succès tant auprès des jeunes que des vieux.${prompt}
  11942: C'était le premier cirque que j'avais jamais vu de ma vie, et j'étais complètement sous le charme.${prompt}
  11943: Lorsque le moment est venu de plier bagage et de partir, j'étais déterminée à les rejoindre. Je voulais tellement rejoindre la Troupe Valeriano que je ne tenais pas compte des objections autour de moi.${prompt}
  11944: Attendez !${prompt}
  11945: Et vous êtes...?${prompt}
  11946: Je m'appelle Laila Brilioth, et je suis la meilleure danseuse de la ville !${prompt}
  11947: Ah, oui...${prompt}
  11948: Je suis allé voir les performances de votre troupe, et j'ai bien aimé ce que j'ai vu !${prompt}
  11949: Eh bien, je suis heureux de l'entendre. Merci.${prompt}
  11950: J'ai donc décidé de vous rejoindre.${prompt}
  11951: Vraiment...${prompt}
  11952: Votre troupe sera tellement mieux avec moi en danseuse.${prompt}
  11953: Merci pour votre offre...${prompt}
  11954: Mais, non merci.${prompt}
  11955: Hein...?${prompt}
  11956: Je suis désolé, mais je ne peux pas vous accepter dans notre troupe.${prompt}
  11957: Je ne comprends pas... Pourquoi ne voulez-vous pas m'accepter ?${prompt}
  11958: Si vous me regardiez danser, vous verriez à quel point je suis douée !${prompt}
  11959: J'ai déjà pris ma décision, donc cela ne sera pas nécessaire. Je suis vraiment désolé...${prompt}
  11960: '...${prompt}'
  11961: |-
    <Reniflement> 
    Quelle histoire bouleversante...${prompt}
  11962: Pas longtemps après, un grand incendie a détruit la tente de la Troupe Valeriano et tout leur matériel. Les membres ont été forcés de se séparer.${prompt}
  11963: Tous les danseurs sont partis aussi.${prompt}
  11964: Ce fut un grand revers, et je ressens sincèrement leur malheur. Mais, je n'ai jamais oublié l'humiliation que j'ai ressentie quand j'ai été rejetée.${prompt}
  11965: Après l'incident, j'ai quitté la maison et formé la Troupe Brilioth.${prompt}
  11966: J'étais déterminée à surpasser la Troupe Valeriano, et j'ai fait tout ce que je pouvais pour arriver là où je suis aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  11967: Je suis fière de ce que j'ai accompli. Mais par-dessus tout, je suis fière de vous tous.${prompt}
  11968: Je n'ai jamais oublié l'humiliation que j'ai ressentie quand j'ai été rejetée par Valeriano.${prompt}
  11969: Je ne savais pas que Laila avait croisé la route de la Troupe Valeriano dans le passé...${prompt}
  11970: Je n'arrive pas à croire que la Troupe Valeriano ait rejeté une grande danseuse comme Laila... Qu'est-ce qu'ils pensaient ?${prompt}
  11971: ${name-player}, juste l'aventurier que je cherchais.${prompt}
  11972: Je pensais qu'il était temps que tu montes sur scène, et...${prompt}
  11973: '...?${prompt}'
  11974: Salut tout le monde ! Vous devez être la Troupe Brilioth !${prompt}
  11975: Et qui êtes-vous donc ?${prompt}
  11976: Le nom est Wyatt, et je travaille dans le secteur des spectacles. Boy, j'ai une proposition pour vous !${prompt}
  11977: Pour ma prochaine production, j'ai organisé la venue de la Troupe Valeriano pour se produire ici à Jeuno.${prompt}
  11978: Et je pensais à moi-même, ce serait magnifique si les troupes Brilioth et Valeriano pouvaient collaborer dans un spectacle de cirque et de danse !${prompt}
  11979: Voici les détails de ma proposition... Alors, qu'en pensez-vous ?${prompt}
  11980: Ça semble intéressant... Mais qu'en pense la Troupe Valeriano ?${prompt}
  11981: Eh bien, madame, c'est justement le problème... La Troupe Valeriano est occupée à faire la tournée des trois nations, donc je n'ai pas encore eu l'occasion de leur en parler correctement.${prompt}
  11982: Pourquoi ne nous laissez-vous pas faire ça ? On ira les informer pour vous.${prompt}
  11983: Eh bien, n'est-ce pas gentil ! Je vous serais très reconnaissant si vous pouviez leur transmettre la proposition. Je suppose qu'on se verra plus tard alors.${prompt}
  11984: ${name-player}, je veux que tu prennes cette proposition et que tu la remettes au magasin de musique des Marchés de Bastok, et que tu la passes au propriétaire de l'établissement.${prompt}
  11985: Valeriano va souvent là-bas, m'a-t-on dit.${prompt}
  11986: 'Passe ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} au propriétaire du magasin de musique des Marchés de Bastok. Valeriano est censé être un client habituel.${prompt}'
  11987: Pourquoi Laila a-t-elle accepté une collaboration ? Je pensais qu'elle n'aimait pas la Troupe Valeriano...${prompt}
  11988: Oh là là... Rien que d'y penser, danser aux côtés de la Troupe Valeriano me donne des papillons dans le ventre.${prompt}
  11989: Quoi ? Tu as rencontré Valeriano lui-même au magasin de musique ?${prompt}
  11990: Alors... qu'est-ce qu'il a pensé de la proposition ?${prompt}
  11991: Vraiment ? Il était aussi enthousiaste ? Eh bien, n'est-ce pas adorable...${prompt}
  11992: Hahahahahaaa !${prompt}
  11993: J'ai attendu ce jour pendant si longtemps... le jour où je surpasserai Valeriano.${prompt}
  11994: Quand Wyatt est venu ici et nous a parlé de son plan, j'ai à peine pu contenir mon excitation.${prompt}
  11995: Inutile de dire que tu danseras avec nous aussi, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11996: C'est l'occasion rêvée...${prompt}
  11997: Nous allons montrer à la Troupe Valeriano qui le public préfère.${prompt}
  11998: Ça me rappelle, tu n'as jamais joué sur scène avant, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  11999: Si tu demandes à Rhea Myuliah, elle te donnera des astuces et des conseils pour plaire au public quand tu danses.${prompt}
  12000: Nous dansons pour de vrai cette fois, alors pas de paresse avant la performance !${prompt}
  12001: Pas de paresse avant la performance !${prompt}
  12002: Une collaboration, c'est une chose, mais un face-à-face ? Que peut bien penser Laila ?${prompt}
  12003: Pour la prochaine performance, nous danserons avec la Troupe Valeriano qui se produira à côté de nous.${prompt}
  12004: "Le but de cette collaboration est de permettre au public de profiter à la fois de spectacles de cirque et de danse simultanément... \nMais Laila est déterminée à surpasser la Troupe Valeriano.${prompt}"
  12005: Nous devons donc performer un style de danse qui plaira et attirera l'attention du public.${prompt}
  12006: Juste pour vous donner une idée générale...${prompt}
  12007: Les jeunes préfèrent généralement la valse, les personnes âgées sont plus fans de samba, tandis que les petits ne se lassent pas des jigs.${prompt}
  12008: Pendant que tu danses, observe quel type de public regarde la performance du cirque de la Troupe Valeriano, puis danse un style qui correspond à leurs goûts.${prompt}
  12009: Si tu fais cela, le public tournera sûrement son attention vers la performance de la Troupe Brilioth à la place.${prompt}
  12010: Mais tu ne dois pas négliger ceux qui nous regardent déjà.${prompt}
  12011: Si un style de danse n'est pas à leur goût, ce n'est qu'une question de temps avant que le public ne tourne son attention ailleurs.${prompt}
  12012: Est-ce que ça a du sens ? Tu veux t'entraîner ?${prompt}

    Pratiquer pour plaire au public ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Allons-y !
    Peut-être plus tard...${prompt}
  12014: Je sais ce que tu ressens... Compétir pour le public n'est pas ma conception du plaisir non plus, mais faisons de notre mieux, d'accord ?${prompt}
  12015: Très bien, je vais faire semblant d'être la Troupe Valeriano... bien que je ne sache pas jongler ou quoi que ce soit.${prompt}

    Valse
    Samba
    Jig${prompt}

  12018: C'était génial, ${name-player} ! Laila sera contente si tu continues sur cette lancée.${prompt}
  12019: Excusez notre retard. J'espère que vous n'avez pas trop attendu.${prompt}
  12020: J'ai attendu dix longues années. Quelques minutes de plus ne feront aucune différence.${prompt}
  12021: Hm...? Je ne suis pas sûr de comprendre.${prompt}
  12022: Valeriano, aujourd'hui c'est le jour où je vais te faire regretter de m'avoir rejetée !${prompt}
  12023: L-Laila...${prompt}

    Tu te souviens ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Bien sûr !
    Euh...${prompt}
  12026: Je ne t'avais pas demandé de te préparer pour aujourd'hui ? Rhea, donne à ${name-player} un petit rappel !${prompt}
  12027: Tout de suite, Laila.${prompt}
  12028: Tu as compris ?${prompt}
  12029: Donne au public ce qu'il veut pour qu'il nous regarde et non la Troupe Valeriano !${prompt}
  12030: Assez parlé. ${name-player}, montre-leur ce que tu as !${prompt}

  12033: Grrr... On gardera le reste pour demain. Ce n'est pas encore fini...${prompt}
  12034: On leur montrera la prochaine fois.${prompt}
  12035: Perdre contre la Troupe Valeriano comme ça... <Sigh>${prompt}
  12036: On t'a laissé facile hier, mais plus maintenant ! Aujourd'hui, je vais te faire regretter de m'avoir rejetée pour rejoindre la Troupe Valeriano !${prompt}

  12043: Il y a bien des années, c'est toi qui jouais de la pipe au lac Mechieume...${prompt}
  12044: Tu as déjà entendu le son argenté de la pipe du boss ?${prompt}
  12045: Aye... Il y a longtemps, quand j'étais encore enfant...${prompt}
  12046: |-
    Je suis née fille d'une famille de danseurs renommée, et j'ai grandi en plein cœur de la Guerre du Cristal...
    La danse était ma vie, et tout ce que je connaissais. Mais un jour, j'en ai eu marre des entraînements sans fin, et j'ai décidé de fuir à la maison.${prompt}
  12047: C'est à ce moment-là que j'ai entendu la pipe pour la première fois, près du lac Mechieume. Sa mélodie envoûtante a traversé mon âme, guidant chaque pas, chaque tour et pirouette...${prompt}
  12048: Elle a ravivé ma passion vacillante pour la danse et m'a inspiré à continuer. Tout ce que j'ai, je le dois à cette pipe.${prompt}
  12049: Je n'ai pas oublié ce jour, Laila... le jour où je t'ai vue danser pour la première fois.${prompt}
  12050: Tu nous observais...?${prompt}
  12051: C'était la plus belle chose que j'aie jamais eu le privilège de voir.${prompt}
  12052: Quand ${name-player} m'a remis la proposition à Bastok, j'ai remercié la Déesse de m'avoir donné la chance de te voir danser à nouveau.${prompt}
  12053: '......${prompt}'
  12054: B-bien sûr, mais je ne peux pas le faire... Je n'en ai plus la force. Depuis le jour où tu m'as rejetée, mon seul but dans la vie a été de te surpasser.${prompt}
  12055: La seule raison pour laquelle j'ai dansé toutes ces années, c'était pour pouvoir te regarder de haut. Je-je ne mérite pas d'être danseuse...${prompt}
  12056: C'est moi qui suis responsable de t'avoir causé tant de douleur. S'il te plaît, pardonne-moi, Laila.${prompt}
  12057: Mais... je crois toujours fermement que j'ai pris la bonne décision. Ce serait mal d'accepter la danseuse la plus prometteuse que Vana'diel ait jamais vue dans notre troupe.${prompt}
  12058: Quoi...?${prompt}
  12059: Tu as grandi entourée de gens qui t'aimaient, et tu étais destinée à devenir la successeure du fameux style Brilioth.${prompt}
  12060: Bien que jeune, ton talent était déjà incomparable. Jamais une danseuse aussi jeune n'avait été choisie pour diriger la production de ta mère--même moi, je le savais...${prompt}
  12061: Mais je n'avais pas le droit de t'arracher à l'endroit où tu devais être.${prompt}
  12062: Tu méritais bien plus que ce que j'aurais pu t'offrir dans ma troupe.${prompt}
  12063: Aucun chapiteau de cirque ne pourrait jamais être assez grand pour que tu puisses grandir et réaliser ton potentiel, Laila...${prompt}
  12064: Alors... tu m'as rejetée non pas parce que tu pensais que je n'étais pas assez bien ?${prompt}
  12065: La réponse est claire, Laila. Tu es tout ce qu'un danseur pourrait rêver d'être.${prompt}
  12066: Je regrette de ne pas avoir expliqué ma décision plus clairement quand je t'ai rejetée.${prompt}
  12067: Même si tu l'avais fait, je ne pense pas que j'aurais compris...${prompt}
  12068: Je voulais tellement rejoindre la Troupe Valeriano, j'ai perdu de vue tout ce qui comptait pour moi...${prompt}
  12069: J'étais--et je suis--juste une stupide fille...${prompt}
  12070: Tu n'as pas à avoir honte.${prompt}
  12071: Regarde juste la merveilleuse troupe de danse que tu as créée ! Jette un œil à tous ces fans qui t'aiment !${prompt}
  12072: V-Valeriano...${prompt}
  12073: Laila... Accepteras-tu l'honneur de danser pour moi ? Comme à cette époque, il y a tant d'années ?${prompt}
  12074: Oui !${prompt}
  12075: Je n'ai jamais autant pris de plaisir à performer qu'aujourd'hui. J'ai vraiment hâte de notre prochaine collaboration.${prompt}
  12076: D'accord tout le monde, il est temps de partir.${prompt}
  12077: Hm ?${prompt}
  12078: Ce caillou...${prompt}
  12079: 'Le jumeau de mon ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}... Alors tu l’avais avec toi tout ce temps.${prompt}'
  12080: Ils se sont enfin retrouvés...${prompt}
  12081: Je vais repartir à zéro. Comme le jour où j'ai trouvé ce caillou près du lac.${prompt}
  12082: Je suis sûr qu'il ne faudra pas vingt autres années avant que je ne te voie danser à nouveau. Je te souhaite tout le meilleur, Laila.${prompt}
  12083: Est-ce que mes yeux me jouent des tours ? Est-ce que cela pourrait réellement être... vrai ?${prompt}
  12084: De quoi je parle ?${prompt}
  12085: Tu vois, il y a une légende qui dit que les danseurs les plus talentueux et gracieux sont visités par la Divinité de la Danse.${prompt}
  12086: Mais je n'y ai jamais vraiment cru jusqu'à aujourd'hui... Juste maintenant, quand Laila dansait, j'aurais juré...${prompt}
  12087: Mais avant que j'oublie, Laila voulait te donner quelque chose, ${name-player}. Pourquoi ne pas aller lui parler ?${prompt}
  12088: Ce fut une sacrée première performance, ${name-player}. Tu ne cesses de m'impressionner.${prompt}
  12089: Rien n'est plus vrai que "l'entraînement fait le maître". Tiens, ceci est pour tout ton travail acharné.${prompt}
  12090: J'ai été un idiot toutes ces années, en utilisant la danse juste pour essayer de réparer mon ego brisé.${prompt}
  12091: C'est un peu embarrassant à admettre, mais cela fait longtemps que je n'ai pas pris autant de plaisir à danser.${prompt}
  12092: Comme j'aimerais pouvoir danser à nouveau aux côtés de Valeriano...${prompt}
  12093: Tiens, prends ceci. Tu le mérites pour tout ton travail acharné.${prompt}
  12094: La danse peut parfois être insaisissable--plus tu cherches, plus tu perds de vue ce que tu veux...${prompt}
  12095: Quand cela arrive, vide tous les pensées inutiles de ton esprit et tout ira bien.${prompt}
  12096: Je vais m'efforcer de devenir une grande danseuse comme Laila.${prompt}
  12097: Mon dieu ! Je ne me souviens pas de la dernière fois où je me suis autant amusée !${prompt}
  12098: |-
    Tu es tellement jolie !
    J'aimerais être danseuse comme toi un jour !${prompt}
  12099: Je me souviens d'une époque pendant la Guerre des Cristaux où je me suis retrouvé entouré par l'ennemi au combat. J'avais perdu tout espoir quand les danseurs Musiciens de Terrain sont venus à ma rescousse.${prompt}
  12100: Avec à peine plus qu'un geste gracieux de leurs bras, mes blessures ont été guéries et mes douleurs apaisées. On aurait dit que la Déesse elle-même était descendue de son royaume céleste...${prompt}
  12101: |-
    La performance était émouvante au-delà des mots.
    Je n'ai pas un doute dans mon cœur que la Divinité de la Danse existe...${prompt}
  12102: Tu t'entraînes dur comme d'habitude, ${name-player} ?${prompt}
  12103: 'J’ai voulu te demander, as-tu déjà entendu parler de ${item-plural: 0[2]} ?${prompt}'

  12312: Come on, say yes! It'll be great, I guarantee!${prompt}

    Come on, you have to say yes!
    If you don't, I'll tell everyone I beat you anyway!${prompt}

  12359: |-
    That's odd, though...
    He always struck me as a bit more...literate?${prompt}
  12360: |-
    Then again, he is a busy moogle.
    Contracts to sign, inspections to oversee, deadbeat adventurers to evict...
    You know how it is, kupo. Perhaps he was just in a hurry?${prompt}
  12361: Anyway, let's take a swift survey of the area, shall we?${prompt}

    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]} should do the trick, don't you think?${prompt}

    An adventurer with your mining mastery should be able to find it in a flash, kupo!

    While you're out, I'll take up my tools and get cracking.

    Knowing him, he'll fix these right up into lavish three-bedroom suites fit for King Kupofried himself!
    That's just the magnanimous moogle he is, kupo.${prompt}

    Just leave it to me! I'll draft up an official renovation request.

    What's that, Master?
    Why, of course it's required for the repairs!
    Whatever are you insinuating, kupo!?${prompt}

    I wouldn't dream of roasting it medium-rare, glazed with a delectable dragon-fruit-and-rolanberry sauce, and serving it on a romantic candlelit dinner date with my darling Kupiruru!

  12634: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  12635: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  12636: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  12637: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  12638: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  12639: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  12640: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  12641: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  12642: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  12643: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  12644: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  12645: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  12646: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  12647: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  12648: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12649: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  12650: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  12651: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  12652: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  12653: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  12654: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  12655: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  12656: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  12657: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12658: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  12659: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  12660: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  12661: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  12662: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  12663: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  12664: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  12665: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  12666: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  12667: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  12668: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  12669: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  12670: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  12671: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  12672: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  12673: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  12674: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  12675: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  12676: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  12677: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  12678: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  12679: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  12680: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  12681: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  12682: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  12683: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12684: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  12685: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  12686: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  12687: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  12688: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  12689: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  12690: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  12691: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  12692: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  12693: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  12694: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  12695: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  12696: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12697: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  12698: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  12699: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  12700: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  12701: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  12702: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  12703: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  12704: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  12705: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  12706: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  12707: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  12708: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  12709: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  12710: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  12711: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  12712: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  12713: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  12714: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  12715: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  12716: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  12717: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}

    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  12738: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  12739: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'

    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  12741: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  12742: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  12743: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  12744: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  12745: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  12746: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}

    Yes. One could say I'm feeling decent enough.
    I suppose I owe the two of you my thanks.${prompt}

    I must admit, I'm feeling quite energized.
    I owe you and ${name-player} here a debt of gratitude.${prompt}

    You and ${name-player} have my sincere gratitude.${prompt}

  13022: |-
    You know it, Luto.
    There's no feeling finer than that of surpassing your limits, and it's you and ${name-player} here that have made it possible.${prompt}

    Why, yes, I feel excellent. It's even done wonders for my complexion.
    How can I ever thank the two of you?${prompt}

    You bet, Luto!
    These are the days I feel alive, and I owe it all to you and ${name-player}!${prompt}

    I do not exaggerate when I say that it is as if I am ten times the woman I was.
    How can I ever repay the two of you?${prompt}
  13028: |-
    Why, yes. These trials have got my blood stirring as nothing before.
    I owe much to this Magian Mooglehood...and the two of you, I suppose.${prompt}
  13029: |-
    Don't mention it!
    Nothing pleases me more than being able to perform a favor for my frrriends.${prompt}
  13030: |-
    ...But hey, that's all I can do for today.
    Business just isn't what it used to be, I'm afraid.${prompt}

    Oh well, then.
    You know where to find me if you need me, ${name-player}.
    I...look forward to our next adventure together.${prompt}
  13032: |-
    Truly a shame! And here I was ready to set right off on my next assignment.
    Fortunately, ${name-player} and I still have many adventures ahead!
    Isn't that right, my friend?${prompt}
  13033: |-
    Alas, but there is nothing to be done.
    Well, ${name-player}. When you next feel the call of adventure, you know where to find me.${prompt}
  13034: |-
    I suppose I cannot complain, as it is a plight I brought upon myself.
    Well, ${name-player}, shall we go adventuring in the meantime?${prompt}
  13035: |-
    Aw man, what a bummer!
    Why don't we take our frustrations out on some nasty fiends, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13036: |-
    Let's not let the rough times get us down, ${name-player}.
    Adventure calls, and like a lady, we'd best not keep her waiting!${prompt}

    ...I see. Well, ${name-player}, it would seem this is as good a time as any for our next adventure.
    What do you say?${prompt}
  13038: |-
    Yikes! That's a shame.
    Good thing there's still plenty of adventures out there to be had! Right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13039: |-
    These must be difficult times indeed.
    Still, as long as ${name-player} and I are together, we can find our own adventure. Is that not so?${prompt}
  13040: |-
    Aw, Luto, that's really too bad!
    Well, ${name-player}, why don't we cheer ourselves up with an adventure or two?${prompt}
  13041: |-
    Well, ${name-player}, it would seem there is nothing for us to do but go in search of our own adventure.
    Shall we be off?${prompt}
  13042: |-
    Then I bid you farewell for now, Luto.
    And you, ${name-player}. I thirst for adventure, and I trust that you will answer the call.${prompt}

    Such acumen may very well be thanks to the bonds we have forged together in battle, Luto.
    ${name-player}, I am at your service. Might I suggest we first make our way to the Ru'Lude Gardens?${prompt}

    Maybe doing all these trials in tandewhatsit has bestowed us with some magical connective powers?

    This will be our fourth trial in tandem. I did not get this far by ignoring ${name-player}'s behavior.

    I never once considered the bind in which my failures would entrap you...${prompt}
  13098: |-
    How unbecoming of me.
    I am supposed to help contribute to your business, yet I cannot even do that...${prompt}
  13099: |-
    I feel so immensely terrible, Luto!
    Never in my wildest dreams did I mean to inflict such misery upon you!${prompt}
  13100: |-
    I cannot help but feel responsible for this.
    You can place all the blame on me and my shortcomings as an adventurer.${prompt}
  13101: |-
    I feel sorrier than a salted sea slug, Luto!
    What can I do to make things better!? I'll do everything within my power to help you!${prompt}
  13102: |-
    I alone should bear this burden--not you, Luto.
    You have been so kind to me, despite my myriad missteps.${prompt}
  13103: |-
    I'm sorry, Luto.
    I should not have failed you so.${prompt}
  13104: Cut the histrrrionics! Are you an adventurer or some mewling kitten!?${prompt}
  13105: Keep your chin up and concentrate on your trrrial. I don't want to get your fur all in knots before you even start, so let's just forget I said anything, okay?${prompt}
  13106: Jeuno's a big place, teeming with people facing all sorts of prrroblems. It should take only two swishes of a tail before one of them brings us some work!${prompt}
  13107: |-
    And when they do, I'll make sure to tuck it away until you're done training.
    Then you can clear it in a heartbeat and show the world just how much your skills have imprrroved!${prompt}
  13108: |-
    After that, word of your magnificent feat will spread throughout the town and offers will come pouring in!
    And I'll be able to feast to my hearrrt's content!
    Yes...yes...I can taste the bison steak already.${prompt}
  13109: |-
    I'll be rrright here--you two and the steak in my thoughts--waiting to hear some juicy stories upon your rrreturn.
    I know you'll make easy prey of those fiends, and that's why I'm counting on you!${prompt}
  13110: Such words hardly come naturally to me, but...thank you, Luto.${prompt}
  13111: Our days of glory shall come, Luto, and I shall be the one to usher them in!${prompt}
  13112: You have my thanks, Luto. I'll return that kind gesture the first chance I get.${prompt}
  13113: Your largess knows no limits, Luto. I am in your debt.${prompt}
  13114: Luto, you...you're like the elder sister I never had! Thank you so much!${prompt}
  13115: I don't often lose my composure, but when I do, it's usually to heartfelt encouragement like this, Luto.${prompt}
  13116: You're too kind, Luto.${prompt}
  13117: That's the Luto I know and love! You always find the right words to lift my spirits!${prompt}
  13118: I'm truly grateful for the kind words you've bestowed upon me, Luto.${prompt}
  13119: Luto... <sniff> I promise I won't let you down!${prompt}
  13120: I feel that your compassion may be wasted on someone such as myself, but I am truly grateful nevertheless.${prompt}
  13121: I feel ready for anything after that impassioned speech, Luto. I'll make sure to rouse your spirits the next time they need it!${prompt}
  13122: |-
    Whew, that's one obstacle down. You're on your own from here on out, but you know the prrroverb: when Altana gives you Azouph greens, charm a chocobo.♪
    Anyway, I wish you the best of luck!${prompt}
  13123: |-
    Oh ho. I see you're still both in one piece. Congratulations then on your trrriumph.
    How do you feel? Have you noticed any changes since your departure?${prompt}
  13124: |-
    As tedious as these trials are, I think I'm ready for another. Why, this is the strongest I've felt since I kicked that little...
    No, I'd best not say any more.${prompt}
  13125: Now I'm light as a cloud and tough as a tree! My hands can hit what even my eyes don't see!${prompt}
  13126: I'm not half bad. I wager I could go one-on-one with the Shadow Lord and barely even break a sweat.${prompt}
  13127: I feel quite empowered, thank you. All my senses seem heightened to the point where, for a fleeting moment, I almost questioned my mortality.${prompt}
  13128: What can I say? I'm ready to sink my teeth deep into the next job and tear off a chunk of absolute victory!${prompt}
  13129: |-
    I feel good enough to ask you out to dinner with me next week.
    Stay that thought! I'm not sure you're ready for me yet, my dear.${prompt}
  13130: This is a wonderful feeling. I am quite sure that were I to gaze into a mirror, all my senses as well as my face would be given point.${prompt}
  13131: I've never felt anything like this! I could take on all the evil in Vana'diel and emerge unscathed, to say nothing of your next task for me!${prompt}
  13132: This is a splendid feeling indeed. A simple wave of my hand seems sufficient to accomplish even the most arduous of tasks.${prompt}
  13133: |-
    This feeling is the best! It's like I huffed and puffed and blew down a wall that was blocking me!
    Now, what would you call that? A boundary bust, maybe?${prompt}
  13134: What a spectacular sensation. I can feel an unbelievable power welling up from the very depths of my being, surging through my limbs...${prompt}
  13135: I feel like I could claim all the world with a swift stroke of martial justice that's been sharpened upon my newly heightened senses.${prompt}
  13136: It's good to see you're enjoying your powerrrs.${prompt}
  13137: |-
    And while I'd like to rrreward your vim with an equally vigorous assignment, I don't have any right now.
    As I'm out of other ideas, why not continue training with ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13138: I suppose if there's nothing better to do...${prompt}
  13139: You won't be sorry, Luto. I promise to be so valiant that you'll hear minstrels singing my praises before I even return!${prompt}
  13140: If that's how it is, that's how it is. I have no qualms with more training.${prompt}
  13141: As long as you suggest such a course of action, Luto, I shall heed your sage advice.${prompt}
  13142: |-
    You're abso-truly-complelutely fine with me training some more!?
    You're the greatest, Luto!${prompt}
  13143: How do you always know exactly what to say to me, Luto? A purrrfect response, if I do say so myself.${prompt}
  13144: That would be simply divine! What a wonderful idea, Luto.${prompt}
  13145: |-
    Really!? Can I!?
    Then I'm going slay so many monsters that I'll forget why I'm slaying them in the first place!${prompt}
  13146: You are more than kind, Luto, and I shall avail myself of your generous offer.${prompt}
  13147: |-
    They say faith makes you stronger, and I have crates of faith in both you and ${name-player}!
    A little more training and I should be almost invincible!${prompt}
  13148: I shan't question your acumen, Luto. If that is what you suggest, I shall devote myself to training as thoroughly as possible.${prompt}
  13149: |-
    Is that your consent I hear?
    Then ${name-player} and I shall form an army of two, leaving nothing but a wake of utter destruction in our path.${prompt}
  13150: Don't pull any punches, either. I think it'd be the cat's meow if you come back even strrronger.${prompt}
  13151: The same goes for you, ${name-player}. You wouldn't want the disciple to become the masterrr, would you?♪${prompt}
  13152: The faster we depart, the faster we can finish this errand. Therefore, I'll be taking my leave now.${prompt}
  13153: I'll forge the way for us, ${name-player}! Just make sure you don't fall too far behind!${prompt}
  13154: I'll take the lead on this one and let you bring up the rear, ${name-player}. Rendezvous with me when you're able.${prompt}
  13155: |-
    I beg your leave.
    I apologize for my early departure, ${name-player}, but I shan't be too far ahead.${prompt}
  13156: I'm going to run on ahead, ${name-player}. Catch up with me if you can!${prompt}
  13157: |-
    Well, ${name-player}, I'm going on ahead. Just call my name if you find yourself in trouble.
    ...And here's looking at you, Luto. You're welcome to join us anytime.${prompt}
  13158: Well, I'm off. Remember, ${name-player}, no dilly-dallying. Finish what you have to do, then hurry right along.${prompt}
  13159: |-
    I can barely contain myself. I mean I can't contain myself at all!
    You better not linger long, ${name-player}, or there won't be any monsters left for you to practice on!${prompt}
  13160: |-
    And this is where I take my leave.
    Should you require my presence, ${name-player}, simply say the word and it shall take me mere moments to appear at your side.${prompt}
  13161: |-
    I'm going to leave now so I can start training right away.
    You're going to be so proud of me, ${name-player}. I just know it!${prompt}
  13162: |-
    Please excuse me, I must be going now.
    If you would be so kind as to let me know when you leave, ${name-player}, I would be extremely appreciative.${prompt}
  13163: "Good-bye, Luto. \nAnd ${name-player}, if you don't make haste after your conversation's finished, the consequences will be...how should I say...excruciating?\nBwahaha!${prompt}"
  13164: Hmmm. I should prrrobably get this business back up and running soon.${prompt}
  13165: I realize that capable adventurers like you and your friend won't stay satisfied with trrraining missions forever, now, will you?${prompt}
  13166: Maybe my old scrrratching post will help me come up with some good ideas to get back on track.${prompt}
  13167: Anyway, get out there and rrraise hell, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13168: "I knew you'd be back, ${name-player}. \nYou seem to sense exactly when I'm in the mood for your special serrrvices.${prompt}"
  13169: |-
    Oh, you. Stop prrretending to be such a kitten.
    We both know how quickly you get down to business.${prompt}
  13170: |-
    And that business starts with taking another missive to that hoary hairball in the Ru'Lude Gardens.

  13179: The only kind of magnetism you possess is the type that repels paying jobs. How much shall I wager that this is just another training mission?${prompt}
  13180: |-
    Your whiskers really told you that, Luto? Because I came here after my adventurer's sense began tingling!
    We're so alike that we should start a business together! One where I get to do real jobs and not just train all the time!${prompt}
  13181: I assume this is just the usual training excursion? Would you be kind enough to remind me what sort of business we're running, again?${prompt}
  13182: |-
    Your mental acuity is most laudable, Luto. I expected nothing less from my employer.
    I shall expend my utmost effort in hopes this training will lead to more steady work.${prompt}
  13183: Awww, another trial in tandem? Just how many of these things are there!?${prompt}
  13184: A new training mission, eh? Well, I'm certainly not one to pass up a chance at impressing the ladies...especially after how I wowed the crowd last time.${prompt}
  13185: Thank you for thinking of me and ${name-player}, Luto. It's just such a shame these trials never lead to actual work...${prompt}
  13186: Yes! Another chance for me to kick some serious monster tuchus! Still, when I think of how we haven't gotten any work in forever...I...I...waaahhh!${prompt}
  13187: |-
    It's time once again for a trial in tandem, is it?
    Of course, I'm completely fine with undertaking this task so crucial to my own development, but--if I may--it does seem a tad suspicious that we never actually receive any job offers.${prompt}
  13188: You mean we're going off on another tangemawhatsit? Then I have to dig down deep and find my inner strength so we can bop those baddies and get some real work!${prompt}
  13189: "Your perspicacity is nonpareil, Luto. I wouldn't want to work under anyone else. \nI'm quite confident that after this training mission, work is one thing we shall not be in want of.${prompt}"
  13190: Another one of these cursed trials!? As much as the sight of scattered monster entrails beneath my bootheel excites me, I can't subsist on excitement alone! What about some real work!?${prompt}
  13191: |-
    Heh heh heh. You may think this is just another trial in tandem, but you'd be wrrrong.
    Your ever-resourceful boss has sifted through Jeuno's litterbox of a marketplace and finally come up with a gem of a job! Ha, whoever said, “Curiosity killed the cat” was dumb as a dagon!${prompt}
  13192: 'Our grrracious client''s only request was that we collect ${item-count: 1[2]} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt}'

    And being the genius that I am, I realized you can get ${item-plural: 0[2]} on your quest to stroke that mangy moogle's massive ego.
    It's like getting two goldfish with one scoop of the paw!${prompt}
  13194: Oh...I see. Excuse me, but before we go, I have to dry these premature tears of disappointment I started shedding.${prompt}
  13195: |-
    Yeeeaaah!
    It's time to go a-smashin' and a-bashin' and a-crashin' in the name of good, old-fashioned work!
    Let's grab this opportunity by the horns and shake it 'til they break off! It's Ru'Lude or bust, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13196: |-
    Well, another job had to come eventually. It might as well be now.
    Come on, ${name-player}--to the gardens.${prompt}
  13197: |-
    What a welcome development, Luto. I promise not to disappoint you in this entrepreneurial venture.
    I assume you do not want to disappoint her either, ${name-player}? Then let us depart for Ru'Lude.${prompt}
  13198: |-
    I knew you'd pull through for us, Luto! Yay! We finally did it!
    A chocobo in the stable is worth two in the bush, so let's ride on over to Ru'Lude before our meal ticket leaves town, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13199: |-
    This is just the chance I need to prove how dashing and daring I can be. Be forewarned, Luto, lest you fall so hard for me that you can't get back up.
    ${name-player}. You, me, Ru'Lude. Now.${prompt}
  13200: |-
    Oh my, what impeccable timing! And here I was just thinking how nice it would be if we could see some work drift our way. It must be fate!
    Come now, ${name-player}, it's off to Ru'Lude for us.${prompt}
  13201: |-
    Then I'm the girl for you! Just you wait and see, we'll appease the moogle and have us all swimming in a sea of gil!
    C'mon, ${name-player}, we've not a moment to waste!${prompt}
  13202: |-
    What a pleasant surprise. Thank you for your tireless effort in procuring us employment, Luto.
    May this endeavor prove fruitful for us both, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13203: It's been so long since my last assignment, I think I might've forgotten how to fight, tee hee. Maybe you could teach me again after we visit the magician moogle, ${name-player}? Anyway, toodleoo until Ru'Lude!${prompt}
  13204: |-
    I'm elated to hear we finally have an official assignment.
    ${name-player}, let's both exert as much effort as possible to maximize our employability. For now, though, let us make haste to the Ru'Lude Gardens and the magian moogle.${prompt}
  13205: |-
    Now that's something to get your heart pumping!
    A trial and a job all in one!? So, I get to thrash the dirty hides of fiendish brutes for money? Lace my boots and call me ready!${prompt}

    So, how'd it feel working for the Man--er, Mithra?${prompt}
  13217: |-
    It was refreshing to feel something other than frustration at this eternal struggle for self-betterment.
    I guess it was nice to have been of service, too.${prompt}
  13218: |-
    Just the sight of ${name-player} and me was so imposing that they cowered and ran away without a fight!
    Next time, could you give us something a little more meaty and flavorful?${prompt}
  13219: "Pffft. I could've gotten a wagonful of those things without a problem. \nI don't know if I could even call what we just did “work.”${prompt}"
  13220: It was a valuable learning experience. It will also be liberating to finally not have to rely on my parents for pecuniary aid.${prompt}
  13221: |-
    Why'd you give us such an easy job with barely any clashing, bashing, or mashing?
    Don't think you can coddle me just 'cause I called you my big sister once!${prompt}
  13222: |-
    That was a nice bit of exercise. My muscles are rippling even more than when we set out.
    Fighting beside ${name-player} was all fine and well, but how about you and I meet for a midnight spar sometime, Luto?${prompt}
  13223: Thank you for asking, Luto! Well, knowing I contributed to society this time has given me an even more powerful sense of accomplishment! Without a doubt, I'll be sleeping soundly tonight.${prompt}
  13224: |-
    I'm so worked up I can't even describe how I feel! I was all like, “Boom,” “Hya,” “Shaaa,” the whole time!
    I haven't felt like this in sooo long!${prompt}
  13225: It was both a pleasure and an honor to successfully execute such a significant assignment with ${name-player}. That alone is enough of a reward, and yet I was blessed with this new feeling of empowerment as well. I simply could not be any happier.${prompt}
  13226: It's like I doubled my treasure, doubled my fun, and doubled my power with...ummm, how's that go again? ${prompt}
  13227: It was an invaluable experience and a wonderful opportunity to improve not only my own, but someone else's life as well. I thank you for giving me such a chance, Luto.${prompt}

    Glad to see you grrrabbed this job by the throat and shook the life out of it.

    That's right, Luto. You know exactly how to make this tomcat purr. And if you're ready to accept that offer, you know where to find me.

  13238: |-
    I would be extremely appreciative were you to inform me the moment we receive a new job offer, Luto. I enjoyed this excursion so much, I simply cannot wait to go on another!

    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!

    They're a subterranean race of beastmen that strikingly resemble moles.
    No need to get your britches in a bunch if you haven't, though--studying them is our job.${prompt}
  13307: |-
    We, the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee, have left no stone--figurative or real--unturned in our search for answers about this elusive species.
    Our results suggest that Meebles are rather docile creatures, with little if any culture to speak of. They shouldn't pose much of a threat.${prompt}
  13308: They're easily manipulated, though, and the Moblins have taken advantage of that. They put the Meebles to work throughout a network of burrows.${prompt}
  13309: |-
    Meeble Burrows may be a quaint name, but what sort of fiends lurk amongst these dank caverns? Why are the Moblins making Meebles do their dirty work? And how large are these underground tunnels anyway?

  13327: "Well, well, look who it is. \nWhat do you need this time?${prompt}"
  13328: Finally! I've been waiting for you this whole time.${prompt}
  13329: We thought we had a bead on the Meebles' habitat, but it turns out we were dead wrong. There's another set of caverns in the vicinity of Batallia Downs!${prompt}
  13330: I can't understand how it remained buried for so long. Reports abound that the Moblins have expanded their base of operations and are employing Meebles for “nefarious deeds” once again.${prompt}

    Now it's up to us, the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee, to unearth heaping amounts of knowledge for our glorious archives!
    Oh, and maybe to save the day, too.${prompt}

    What is grimoire engraving?
    Could you tell me about wizened worms?
    Palimpsests? Huh?${prompt}
  13336: |-
    You adventurers can help us collect data by embarking on certain expeditions belowground.
    The goals and activities for each journey you undertake will vary, so this won't be just some routine experiment.${prompt}
  13337: |-
    Although these subterranean caverns may appear simplistic from the outside, their twisting corridors disorient even the Moblins.
    Be careful.${prompt}
  13338: Of course, you'll have to prove your problem-solving skills during more forgiving operations before we let you tackle the truly scary stuff.${prompt}
  13339: |-
    Each expedition has a total of three goals for you to achieve. Complete just one goal or up to all three--the choice is yours.
    However, it should go without saying that the more goals you achieve, the better the reward.${prompt}
  13340: Lastly, the caves are no place for a solo adventurer to be traipsing about. We'll need you to travel in groups of three or more.${prompt}
  13341: |-
    Grimoires are types of magical books that ancient sorcerers brandished in battle long, long ago.
    Now that they've been unearthed again, we can use them for our benefit.${prompt}
  13342: |-
    What's the point of adapting them for use in the burrows? Why, to record the feats of explorers like you.
    Without them, it would be much harder to complete expeditions.${prompt}
  13343: |-
    Like I said, they're no picture books for children.
    They grant powerful effects for each expedition you finish.${prompt}
  13344: |-
    These boons pack a punch from the get-go, but completing expeditions also allows you to increase their potency twice!
    See, I'm sure these grimoires will prove useful in your studies of the Meebles' tunnels.${prompt}
  13345: Just to warn you beforehand, though, boons that affect Auto-Reraise and spoils cannot have their potency increased.${prompt}
  13346: |-
    Another catch is that only the effects of your leader's tome may be bestowed upon your party for normal expeditions.
    Hopefully that should be all the firepower you need, though.${prompt}
  13347: 'At the moment we only have ${number: 0} types of grimoires available, but we do plan on adding to that number eventually.${prompt}'

  13353: |-
    It may seem like a lot to handle, but there's no need to start shaking in your boots.
    The Burrow Researcher in charge of the burrows you're investigating will help you make all the necessary preparations for that based on your grimoire's records.${prompt}
  13354: Only then can your party leader declare which journey you and your companions shall embark upon.${prompt}
  13355: 'It may smack of red tape, but you can only embark upon expedition #1 of each rank at first. At least you''re allowed to choose any expedition you''ve already proven your worth on.${prompt}'
  13356: Oh, and before I forget--for particularly grueling endeavors, everyone must sign up individually. The higher-ups like to think of it as “exonerating the committee from responsibility” or something I don't understand.${prompt}
  13357: 'After signing up, you''ll <cough> almost <cough> be ready to set off. The thing is...Meebles${choice: 0}[/, like that one over there,/, like that one over there,] roam the mouth of the burrows.${prompt}'
  13358: They don't trust anyone but the Moblins, so you'll have to dance like Moblins, prance like Moblins, and even romance like Moblins to gain access to the caves.${prompt}
  13359: |-
    ...Actually, you'll only need to stink like Moblins.
    I can give you ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} in exchange for a grimoire to make sure you smell the part.${prompt}
  13360: |-
    Don't worry, this method is tried and true.
    Meebles have very bad eyesight, so they mostly use their sense of smell to determine who's who.${prompt}
  13361: 'That sense of smell, however, is unrivaled. Even if you''re the only one who isn''t carrying ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, they''ll sniff you out in an instant.${prompt}'
  13362: In fact, the only reason I haven't been turned into Galka gristle after standing here so long is because I keep one on me at all times.${prompt}
  13363: 'Once the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} does its thing and the Meebles take you down into their burrows, you''re free to experiment all you want.${prompt}'
  13364: '...Oh, but if you ever let enthusiasm get the best of you and forget your objectives, just use ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} to remind yourself.${prompt}'
  13365: There should be Speleological Handbooks secretly placed by our members all over the burrows.${prompt}
  13366: 'Holding your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} up to one should do the trick.${prompt}'
  13367: They can also serve as a way to record your underground activities.${prompt}
  13368: Once you finish an expedition, any information you record will have to be reflected in your grimoire.${prompt}
  13369: 'You''ll be given ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} after completing an expedition.${prompt}'
  13370: 'One puff on your ${item-singular: 1[2]} will allow your whole posse to climb back aboveground.${prompt}'
  13371: 'After making your escape, there''s only one thing left to do. Pay a visit to either the appropriate Burrow Researcher or me and show him your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  13372: 'After making your escape, you can show your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} to me.${prompt}'
  13373: '${choice: 0}[One of us will/I''ll/I''ll] reference the data you''ve collected and catalog it in your grimoire.${prompt}'
  13374: 'If you ever need to escape before completing an expedition, though, you can always use ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} instead.${prompt}'
  13375: |-
    Sadly, using ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} allows only its bearer to come up for air.
    Don't forget to show your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} once you exit, even if you've bowed out midway through.${prompt}
  13376: |-
    There's nothing wrong with leaving in the middle of an expedition.
    You'll never be penalized for it, as we wouldn't want to weaken your adventuring spirit.${prompt}
  13377: 'Oh, and if you''ve been wondering how to get ahold of one of these ${item-plural: 3[2]}, you''ll get one from the Meeble guarding the entrance.${prompt}'
  13378: |-
    Some scary, twisted fiends roam the depths of these caverns...at least that's what our scouts who come back alive tell me.
    Of course, you'll likely come face-to-face with these nightmares, too.${prompt}
  13379: |-
    Why? Well, because you'll be tasked with culling one of them after completing the first four expeditions in a course.
    That's why.${prompt}
  13380: Whether you choose to accept such a dangerous mission is all up to you. However, keep this in mind.${prompt}
  13381: Accepting such an assignment means you'll never get back any grimoires we're holding for you.${prompt}
  13382: |-
    That's right. We'll need to archive all the precious data you've collected.
    Jeuno wasn't built in a day, and the same goes for our analysis of Meeble Burrows.${prompt}
  13383: Oh, I almost forgot. For extremely harrowing journeys such as these, everyone must sign up individually.${prompt}
  13384: This way we can be absolutely sure that everyone's prepared for the task at hand. We wouldn't want people without enough experience getting hurt down there.${prompt}
  13385: In return for your cooperation (or to make sure you truly survive), I'll bestow on your whole party the boons everyone has received up until now.${prompt}
  13386: This way you'll all be at your best to face the worst...in the name of science!${prompt}
  13387: This may seem obvious, but you can't just mull around all you want down there.${prompt}
  13388: 'Even if you can use ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to confuse the Meebles, they aren''t stupid enough to ignore you forever.${prompt}'
  13389: |-
    That's why we've set a ${number: 2}-minute limit per expedition (Earth time).
    We want to limit the number of casualties to as few as possible. Safety first, that's our motto.${prompt}
  13390: 'You should also know that we only give out one ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} every ${number: 1} ${choice: 3}[hour/minute]${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] (Earth time).${prompt}'
  13391: |-
    We do want you to be the best researcher you can be, though...
    How about we give you ${number: 3} ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} as a first-time offer? That way you can learn the ropes faster.${prompt}
  13392: It took us a while to realize, but the health of our explorers started failing after they'd carry multiple pouches for long periods of time.${prompt}
  13393: |-
    On the bright side, I'm bound by the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee code to keep up to ${number: 3} of them for you.
    Don't ask why the pouches don't affect me. And if you make a joke about my mother being a Moblin...${prompt}
  13394: |-
    I may be haler and heartier than the average Galka, but there's only so much of that stench I can take.
    If you need more pouches than I can carry, you'd better get yourself a pherobarrier box.${prompt}
  13395: Mind if I change to a fairer smelling subject now?${prompt}
  13396: 'In the event that the spirits haunting these caverns disallow one of your brethren entry, just return aboveground within three minutes without completing any objectives. You''ll be refunded your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} at no cost!${prompt}'
  13397: How nice of the committee, right? Now you don't have to burst a blood vessel if something happens during your descent.${prompt}
  13398: We may have many limits and regulations, but we're not heartless. We also dole out “research marks” to those who help us learn about Meeble Burrows.${prompt}
  13399: |-
    How do you get them? It's simple.
    The more you accomplish down there, the more marks you receive. You can also turn in marks for certain items and equipment.${prompt}
  13400: |-
    There's no need to be a forlorn funguar, either.
    The more fellow researchers on your expedition, the more marks you reap. “The more the merrier” has never rung more true!${prompt}
  13401: Our results suggest that Meebles are rather docile creatures, with little if any culture to speak of. They shouldn't pose much of a threat.${prompt}
  13402: They're easily manipulated, though, and the Moblins have taken advantage of that. They put the Meebles to work in caverns all over the realm.${prompt}
  13403: |-
    Meeble Burrows may be a quaint name, but what sort of fiends lurk amongst these dank caverns? Why are the Moblins making Meebles do their dirty work? And how large are these underground tunnels anyway?
    Maybe we haven't learned as much about the Meebles and their habitat as we thought...${prompt}
  13404: |-
    Wait...if you don't mind crawling through caves and dirtying your own hands for a good cause, how about joining in the exploration?
    We could use another pair of eyes down there. Just talk to me when you decide you'd like to help the scientific community.${prompt}
  13405: I'm sure I don't have to lecture you on receiving certain boons from your grimoire depending on the expeditions you've completed.${prompt}
  13406: But you do remember that boons from one grimoire can't be applied to another, right?${prompt}
  13407: Even worse, you build a relationship with your grimoire only to have it stolen away from you by some unfeeling bookworms right before you set off to slay the most fearsome of monsters!${prompt}
  13408: Well, even if you don't remember, those days are long gone! That's the wonderful thing about science--it progresses!${prompt}
  13409: We've identified unique arcane essences that are released with the completion of some goals and imbue the ink of our pens as we record your exploits.${prompt}
  13410: |-
    Using these essences, we can reconstruct the boons you've received from your grimoire records.
    Let me explain.${prompt}
  13411: 'If you had completed Adjunct Expedition #1, we could inscribe the boons from that expedition onto a blank grimoire.${prompt}'
  13412: Of course the boon would be the same as the one granted from completing that expedition...except for the fact that we can only inscribe level one boons into grimoires. Sorry, but the process is not yet perfect.${prompt}
  13413: |-
    Want to know what else isn't perfect? These inscriptions aren't free.
    It's sad, but grimoires and pheromone sacks don't sprout from the ground, you know!${prompt}
  13414: Meebles use their long sniffers to snuff up odds and ends from the burrow floor.${prompt}
  13415: According to our latest scouting report, they dredged up some things called... Give me a minute here...${prompt}
  13416: |-
    Palimpsests?
    I may not have the biggest brain this side of the Sea of Shu'Meyo, but I do know that these papers are some powerful stuff.${prompt}
  13417: The MBEC now also gives away wizened worms to adventurers who complete objectives.${prompt}
  13418: |-
    Meebles love their wizened worms, and how.
    Quite a non sequitur I pulled on you, right?${prompt}
  13419: |-
    Except it's not!
    Give the Meebles that guard the burrow entrances some of those water-starved wrigglers and they'll give you stuff in return...possibly even some parades...sorry, palisades...uh, palimpsests.${prompt}
  13420: |-
    Ridiculous name, I know. I can barely say it.
    These palimpsests are types of magical paper that temporarily aid everyone in your troop.${prompt}
  13421: All you need to do is trade it to the grimoire inside the caverns and you're good to go.${prompt}
  13422: I haven't been able to use it myself yet, so this might not be true. Still, a friend of a friend told me that while each piece of parchment has three possible effects, you can only choose one!${prompt}
  13423: Don't worry, he assures me that you can choose your desired effect through the wonders of that grimoire down there.${prompt}
  13424: If you want the beat-'em-up power of all three effects, though, you'll need to gather three pieces of parchment.${prompt}

  13760: I'm interested in mounts that can fly. You know about magic pots and spheroids, right?${prompt}
  13761: Flying mounts are great, aren't they?${prompt}
  13762: For somebody like me who only rides chocobos, they're like something straight out of a dream.${prompt}
  13763: Hey! What are you doing-woing!? Did you finish repairing the chocobo stethoscope?${prompt}
  13764: Oh! The stethoscope is almost finished. I think...${prompt}
  13765: Ah, let me guess. He was talking about flying mounts-wounts again, wasn't he?${prompt}
  13766: 'I apologize. Whenever Jeridade sees someone carrying-warrying ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, he immediately starts talking about it nonstop.${prompt}'
  13767: It's like I've always said... It's my dream. Who wouldn't want to fly freely through the skies!?${prompt}
  13768: I know all aboutaru your dream, but you shouldn't go bothering others with it!${prompt}
  13769: You need to startaru with chocobos first, and then work your way up to bombs and magic pots.${prompt}
  13770: Never.${prompt}
  13771: '...${prompt}'
  13772: Fine. How about you aim to be an airship pilotaru then?${prompt}
  13773: Airships are fine and all, but I'd rather fly through the sky like a bird.${prompt}
  13774: I suppose I've got no choice but to make something myself. It'll be a mount that is so stable even I'll be able to ride it!${prompt}
  13775: Okay, I just need to sneak into the Grand Duke Palace and borrow a set of airship blueprints.${prompt}
  13776: Hey, you'll help me, won't you?${prompt}
  13777: W-wait just a momentaru!${prompt}
  13778: I'm just joking. The blueprints won't do me any good without some kind of engine. That's the one thing that I can't make by myself.${prompt}
  13779: Hm... I wonder if there's anything out there that could help me build my own engine...${prompt}
  13780: Maybe it's up above the sky? Or perhaps...${prompt}
  13781: Get back to fixing-wixing that stethoscope already!${prompt}
  13782: I know how he seems, but Jeridade is quite capable-wapable and super smart too, so I imagine if he had the materials, he could probably make a flying mount.${prompt}
  13783: It's all because of Jeridade that we can summon magic pots and warmachines.${prompt}
  13784: I imagine it'll be quite difficultaru, but if you find any information that might help him, can you please let him know?${prompt}
  13785: Oh, remember that I always welcome any astral notebooks-wotebooks that you might find!${prompt}
  13786: Hey, that looks-wooks like an astral notebook!${prompt}
  13787: 'Or maybe not!${sound: 30}${prompt}'
  13788: Wait a momentaru, could this be...${prompt}
  13789: Whoa! What is this!?${prompt}
  13790: This thing really fires up my engineering spirit!${prompt}
  13791: Hm? Did this thing really fly with humans riding-widing it?${prompt}
  13792: Really!? I've got to repair it right away!${prompt}
  13793: The damage to the chassis can be fixed. The problem is the engine...${prompt}
  13794: Let's see... This goes like this... Which means that this...${prompt}
  13795: Hmm... Wait a moment. This here is...${prompt}
  13796: What is it?${prompt}
  13797: I feel as if I've seen this before...${prompt}
  13798: 'I know! I saw it in ${unknown: 0x01053782CC8180}!${prompt}'
  13799: 'Wait! Isn''t ${unknown: 0x01053782CC8180} that place in the north with the ruins-wuins? What were you doing there!?${prompt}'
  13800: Well, I heard a rumor from an adventurer and decided to go check it out on my day off...${prompt}
  13801: That place sure was dangerous! It was so cold that as soon as my nose started running, it froze to my face! I thought I was done for.${prompt}
  13802: Anyways, back to this machine here! So you see, I haven't actually seen the real thing. I think it was displayed on some sort of device.${prompt}
  13803: 'Therefore, we''ll need to go back to ${unknown: 0x01053782CC8180} to find a clue about how to get this thing working!${prompt}'
  13804: Now that's enough of that! If you get yourself killed-willed, who's going to repair the stethoscope!?${prompt}
  13805: Umm... Wh-when you put it like that... I don't know.${prompt}
  13806: 'Oh, I got it! Maybe you could go to ${unknown: 0x01053782CC8180} and search for clues for me?${prompt}'
  13807: I'll keep examining this thing here. And deal with the stethoscope too, of course...${prompt}
  13808: Good luck out there!${prompt}
  13809: '${lettercase: 1}${unknown: 0x01053782CC8180}... I hear it''s quite an unusual place, to say the leastaru. I feel there''s definitely something there.${prompt}'
  13810: Let me know if you find anything out there. Be careful that your nose-wose doesn't freeze off either.${prompt}
  13811: 'By the way, did you happen-wappen to find anything in ${unknown: 0x01053782CC8180}?${prompt}'
  13812: Huh!? Is that...!?${prompt}
  13813: I think you're overreacting a bit...${prompt}
  13814: Besides, it looks like we've got ourselves a new clue!${prompt}
  13815: Amazing! This is exactly what we needed!${prompt}
  13816: 'I took the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} apart for repairs, and there was something just like it in there. Give me a moment to replace it...${prompt}'
  13817: All finished! Let's give it a try, shall we?${prompt}
  13818: Get ready to take off!${prompt}
  13819: Huh!? The chocobos! Waitaru!
  13820: I made a slight mistake with the tuning. Here, I'll fix it right away.${prompt}
  13821: There, it should be fine now.${prompt}
  13822: Well? Care to give it a try?${prompt}
  13823: (I'd be scared too if I were you...)${prompt}
  13824: Alright! It worked!${prompt}
  13825: Okay now, I want you to use it.${prompt}
  13826: I thoughtaru you were making this for yourself, Jeridade.${prompt}
  13827: This Levitus... Oh, that seems to be this mount's name. It's carved into the seat.${prompt}
  13828: Anyways, I'll make my own once I develop a new engine. I think I can use the old one for reference.${prompt}
  13829: Now then... I need to go out and get some parts.${prompt}
  13830: Jeridade! What's got you all excited now!?${prompt}
  13831: Hey! Stop! Don't you run away from me!${prompt}
  13832: Ahh... Looks like he got away...${prompt}
  13833: 'I wonder how this can be register-wegistered in your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  13834: 'Hm? This hasn''t been registered in your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} yet!?${prompt}'
  13835: That reminds me... Didn't it just register itself automatically last time?${prompt}
  13836: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}... I guess there''s something about these older vehicles. I better have Jeridade look into the matter-watter in more detail!${prompt}'
  13837: Hmm... What is the meaning of this...${prompt}
  13838: For now, it looks like you can summon-wummon it, so I'll ask Jeridade about it. I'll be sure to research it myself too!${prompt}
  13839: 'x=${number: 0} y=${number: 1} z=${number: 2}${prompt}'
  13840: 'Ah, how lovely! Let me register your ${item-singular: 0[2]} in your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  13841: 'Amazing-wazing! That''s ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  13842: Wait...I remember reading-weading about the legendary noble chocobos in a treatise by the esteemed Markovich. “Legendary Chocobos of Our Time,” I believe that title was.${prompt}
  13843: Chocobos with such cherry-colored coatarus are of royal lineage and are only born during very specific times of the year.${prompt}
  13844: You must be very special-wecial indeed to have procured such a wonderful companion. I hope you enjoy them!${prompt}
  13845: Oh, what I wouldn't give to ride one!${prompt}
  13846: At the very least, please let me pet them!${prompt}
  13847: 'Either way, let me register your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  13848: 'With this, you should now be able to mount ${choice: 2}[a chocobo/a raptor/a tiger/a crab/a red crab/a bomb/a sheep/a morbol/a crawler/Fenrir/a beetle/a moogle/a magic pot/a tulfaire/a warmachine/a xzomit/a hippogryph/a spectral chair/a spheroid/Omega/a coeurl/a goobbue/a raaz/Levitus/an adamantoise/a dhalmel/a doll/a golden bomb/a buffalo/a wivre/a red raptor/an iron giant/Byakko/a noble chocobo/an ixion/a phuabo].${prompt}'
  13849: Ahh, welcome. Did you happen-wappen to bring an astral notebook with you?${prompt}
  13850: It appears not. Although, I see you have something else you wish for me to take a looksie-wooksie at.${prompt}
  13851: Now then, let me see what you've got there...${prompt}
  13852: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player} showed the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.'
  13853: Hmm... Yes, I see... Oh no!${prompt}
  13854: It seems-weems that I've done it again...${prompt}
  13855: Anyways, this appears to be rather old music. Indeed, it has piqued my interestaru.${prompt}
  13856: Of course, I'm no archaeologistaru or anything. Please tell me if you learn anything new.${prompt}
  13857: 'Hey! That''s the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! Allow me to register-wegister it in the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  13858: Hmm... It's not working for some reason. Please give me a momentaru to check it out.${prompt}
  13859: What is going on here? Oh no, not again!${prompt}
  13860: It seems I was careless-wareless.${prompt}
  13861: Huh? The music-wusic from before was decoded and registered!?${prompt}
  13862: I see... People from the pastaru must've performed the same research I did...${prompt}
  13863: Just thinking about it fills me with a sense-wense of romanticism.${prompt}
  13864: Okay! I've got to give it my very best effortaru!${prompt}
  13865: 'Even a small donation of ${number: 0} gil would allow me to provide medicine to any patient who may need it.${prompt}'
  13866: Thank you so much for your donation. This will save many a life in these trying times.${prompt}
  13867: Thank you so much for your donation. This will save many a life in these trying times.。${prompt}
  13868: Your recent donation is more than sufficient for the time being. Perhaps I will run out and request your services again later.${prompt}
  13869: 'Would you happen to be in possession of any ${item-plural: 0[2]} or ${item-plural: 1[2]}? I require some to further my research, but they can be quite expensive to procure on my own.${prompt}'
  13870: 'Thank you very much for the ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}. I''m sure the fruits of my research will be reflected in my alter ego''s capabilities.${prompt}'
  13871: 'Thank you very much for the ${item-plural: 0[2]}. I''m sure the fruits of my research will be reflected in my alter ego''s capabilities.${prompt}'
  13872: Thank you very much for such expensive medicines. I'm sure the fruits of my research will be reflected in my alter ego's capabilities.${prompt}
  13873: I should have more than enough concoctions for my current needs.${prompt}
  13874: 'I should have more than enough ${item-plural: 0[2]} for my current needs.${prompt}'
  13875: Let us hope that those at Salahaam's Sentinels keep up their end of the bargain...${prompt}
  13876: Ah. And you must be...${prompt}
  13877: ${name-player}. Of course. Your reputation precedes you.${prompt}
  13878: I am well aware of the deeds you have performed for me via your connections in Salaheem's Sentinels.${prompt}
  13879: But where are my manners? I have yet to introduce myself.${prompt}
  13880: I am Elijah, but a humble member of the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (A.M.A.N.).${prompt}
  13881: I have acquired some information about threats that need to be vanquished as part of your excellent work in the Records of Eminence initiative.${prompt}
  13882: I am loath to admit that these foes may be beneath your station, but I would ask you to remove them nonetheless.${prompt}
  13883: |-
    Accept the request?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    No thanks.${prompt}
  13884: You have my gratitude. Allow me to provide you with the relevant intel.${prompt}
  13885: Unfortunate, but not altogether unexpected.${prompt}
  13886: Your quarry resides on the continent of Aradjiah.${prompt}
  13887: Though I would ordinarily rely on local mercenaries for the task, this requires a more...delicate touch.${prompt}
  13888: I promise that the reward will be worthwhile. Double so if you bring proof of the kill.${prompt}
  13889: Should you be able to do so, that is...${prompt}
  13890: While I appreciate your efforts, I am only able to provide you with rewards once per month (Earth time).${prompt}
  13891: I am positive that we will be able to uncover more threats in the upcoming months.${prompt}
  13892: Of course, I will provide you with more information as circumstances warrant.${prompt}
  13893: Once again, your assistance is most appreciated.${prompt}
  13894: Thank you for setting the appropriate objective.${prompt}
  13895: May you strike true.${prompt}
  13896: '${color-alt: 15}Elijah smirks at you.'
  13897: Well, well, if it isn't my favorite intrepid adventurer, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13898: You seem to have been quite busy of late, what with all the fiend slaying and equipment collecting going on.${prompt}
  13899: And in between all your marauding, you still found time to deal with Falak. Heroism truly is your most impressive attribute.${prompt}
  13900: You've really helped me to regain my faith in humanity.${prompt}
  13901: And given your track record and breadth of talents, I would ask another favor of you.${prompt}
  13902: And just as before, this will be handled via Records of Eminence. Have to make sure all the Is are dotted and the Ts crossed, as you know.${prompt}
  13903: For you see, the fiends I hunt are not just limited to Aradjiah.${prompt}
  13904: Although it does seem they aimed to break a particular seal...${prompt}
  13905: '...this time they aim to lay claim to the World Eater Egg. No, this simply will not do.${prompt}'
  13906: This goes directly against the will of my master, and I shall suffer none to cross him.${prompt}
  13907: I trust you will vanquish this threat with all due haste.${prompt}
  13908: We're counting on you, hero.${prompt}
  13909: Pleasure as always, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13910: Your fervor in vanquishing those which threaten us all has not gone unappreciated.${prompt}
  13911: Although perhaps you were only assisting me for baubles and glory rather than righteousness and justice, I must thank you all the same.${prompt}
  13912: So without further ado, permit me to introduce you to your next targets.${prompt}
  13913: You are to make for Aydeewa and Arrapago.${prompt}
  13914: It appears that the dead have redoubled their efforts to usher in the egg's hatching, and it has already been brought to the reef.${prompt}
  13915: And if we can hinder their efforts...well, suffice it to say that my lord will be quite pleased indeed.${prompt}
  13916: Though I would normally be content to leave the dead well alone, I fear that his will is indeed absolute in this matter.${prompt}
  13917: Of course, I need not tell you that for every one you strike down two more will doubtless take its place. I can think of no task more Sisyphean.${prompt}
  13918: Were it up to me, I would see the entire place set ablaze.${prompt}
  13919: I must admit that my mental health has taken a turn for the better knowing I can count on you to handle this issue.${prompt}
  13920: I must remain resolute, for it will not be much longer before my plans come to full fruition.${prompt}
  13921: But I am vexed that my comrades--my lord's right-hand troops--have been lax in their reporting of late.${prompt}
  13922: Doubtless they have their hands full. May the will of my lord be done.${prompt}
  13923: Goddesspeed, hero.${prompt}
  13924: Why won't the dead just stay dead? This goes against all our calculations.${prompt}
  13925: Perhaps they fear my lord's wrath and deemed their chances best on this side of the veil.${prompt}
  13926: Ah, my erstwhile friend! You couldn't have arrived at a more fortuitous time.${prompt}
  13927: At risk of sounding like a broken orchestrion, I confess that I require your assistance once more.${prompt}
  13928: I had been under the impression that the dead were set on returning here, to the world of the living--but it appears I was mistaken.${prompt}
  13929: What their true aim is remains yet a mystery, but one thing is certain--their leader possesses an immense power that defies expectations. Their plans must not be allowed to succeed.${prompt}
  13930: I say this not to diminish the vast capabilities of my master, but to demonstrate to you the commitment of my colleagues and I to ensuring that their machinations bear no fruit.${prompt}
  13931: Yet as the field of battle expands, our forces find themselves stretched increasingly thin. Even my master is vexed at where best to concentrate our efforts.${prompt}
  13932: And so my master created--employed--new soldiers to aid in the efforts. Prompt though their reports were, I found the content thereof to be impudent at best.${prompt}
  13933: “Stop yapping and clean up the stragglers. Those are your orders, and you'd best follow them.”${prompt}
  13934: The audacity! Whether they are right or not is immaterial--their tone is completely unaccpetable.${prompt}
  13935: Ugh. To think they get to me so easily...${prompt}
  13936: The will of my master is paramount. If we are to clean up the “stragglers,” then so be it.${prompt}
  13937: I will fill my charge without fail.${prompt}
  13938: I have taken the liberty of preparing a list of your next targets.${prompt}
  13939: Though information on previous marks was collected by my underlings, this time I have taken it upon myself to collate the necessary materials.${prompt}
  13940: Fear not. It is as accurate as the previous entries. I take my job quite seriously.${prompt}
  13941: It remains to be seen why our foes are mustering their forces here in Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13942: Ah, but you fancy yourself a defender of Vana'diel, do you not? How quaint.${prompt}
  13943: I wish you the best of luck.${prompt}
  13944: What is this? You wish to know if I'm familiar with a black-clad Goblin?${prompt}
  13945: Yes, I have had the displeasure. A more uncouth specimen I have never come across.${prompt}
  13946: But if you're going to wallow in the mud like a pig, then it was only appropriate that I gave them an appropriate porcine companion...so I introduced them to Shami.${prompt}
  13947: Pleasure to see you, ${name-player}. How are those two pig-headed buffoons doing?${prompt}
  13948: “What buffoons?” Why, Shami and Shemo, of course.${prompt}
  13949: I sent them that accursed Goblin and their accompanying retinue. Filth loves its own kind.${prompt}
  13950: Hahaha... Tell me how that turned out?${prompt}
  13951: Wh-what? Not only were the Goblin team not there, but then Duke Alloces...?${prompt}
  13952: But if the gate is closed, then it stands to reason that Duke Alloces shouldn't even be here!${prompt}
  13953: Ugh. This is why you can never trust anything to a low-level demon.${prompt}
  13954: |-
    But setting that small matter aside...
    You are after more information on the World Eater Egg, are you not?${prompt}
  13955: You must wonder what this means for the baneful dead.${prompt}
  13956: Worry not. I have prepared a list of more targets for you.${prompt}
  13957: |-
    Haha...
    Surely each one you banish brings a little bit more peace back to Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13958: Perhaps you have already surmised my true identity, but it is too late for you to turn back now.${prompt}
  13959: After all, the proverbial contract has already been signed.${prompt}
  13960: Hoho...a deal with the devil is not so easily overturned...at least not without paying the ultimate price.${prompt}
  13961: And with what you now know about some of the world's ugly truths, well...${prompt}
  13962: And that lovely retinue who depends on you oh-so-much will surely come through for you in the end.${prompt}
  13963: And of course, my lord Odin is depending on you as well.${prompt}
  13964: And I'm sure none of us want these targets to be in cahoots with Garazu-Horeizu, correct?${prompt}
  13965: Betrayal will be deemed a failure to fulfill the obligations of your contract. Surely I need not say more.${prompt}
  13966: So keep doing what you do best, and there will be no problems.${prompt}
  13967: Ah, and one last thing. If you try to flee, or tell anyone who we really are, it will not end well for you.${prompt}
  13968: This, too, would be an egregious violation of the terms of our little “agreement.”${prompt}
  13969: You see, ${name-player}, we have eyes and ears in every corner of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13970: And we are always watching...listening...${prompt}
  13971: Ah, ${name-player}. Somehow, I knew you would come.${prompt}
  13972: The sealing of the gate has been quite the catalyst. Wouldn't you agree?${prompt}
  13973: My understanding is that you are working together with Skokkr to reforge the Prime Weapons, are you not?${prompt}
  13974: My understanding is that you have worked together with Skokkr and succeeded in reforging a Prime Weapon, have you not?${prompt}
  13975: I wish you all the best in your journey to vanquish Chaos. After all, the Prime Weapons are the keys.${prompt}
  13976: Your Prime Weapon holds the key to besting Chaos, as you doubtless already know.${prompt}
  13977: 'But I would advise you one thing: the Prime Weapons belong to my master, and my master alone.${prompt}'
  13978: And when they return to him, I have no doubt that they will make their way into my hands...as my just reward for all I have accomplished.${prompt}
  13979: Oh, yes. The time for me to wield the Prime Weapons is close at hand.${prompt}
  13980: In fact, this puts me in the mood for a rousing tale. A secondhand tale, so I leave the analysis of its veracity to you.${prompt}
  13981: 5000 years ago, the Prime Weapons were made manifest after an eternity of trial and error.${prompt}
  13982: Those in charge searched endlessly for a way to figure out how to stop Chaos from devouring the astral plane.${prompt}
  13983: Of course, that was eons ago, so the exact time frame isn't clear, but I am led to believe that over one hundred years of effort were poured into this endeavor.${prompt}
  13984: It started with research into souls that hungered for more. A contract between them was established.${prompt}
  13985: But those initial results were...disappointing. More pure souls were required.${prompt}
  13986: I need not spell out for you what that implied.${prompt}
  13987: Many souls were snuffed out on the altar of progress, irrevocably removed from the cycle of life and death.${prompt}
  13988: And that is how those involved eventually arrived at the idea of imbuing souls into implements of power.${prompt}
  13989: If those souls are angered or cry out for vengeance, well...I'm sure that manifests itself in the potency of the armament.${prompt}
  13990: Perhaps that is why the Prime Weapons gleam with that beautiful obsidian light.${prompt}
  13991: Why, it is positively inspiring! Surely you wish to brandish them in battle even more than before.${prompt}
  13992: Ah, but we have time for one more tale. You know of the relic weapons, correct?${prompt}
  13993: My master conceived them during Ragnarok, and they contain the souls of the enlightened races.${prompt}
  13994: My master chose only the strongest from among those who proffered themselves up in his service.${prompt}
  13995: They cried out for succor. Who were we to deny them?${prompt}
  13996: Why, we were even able to help them defend their kingdoms, although perhaps in a different way than they had envisioned.${prompt}
  13997: Not that those nations exist anymore, mind you.${prompt}
  13998: That is enough stories for one day.${prompt}
  13999: I trust you found it a pleasant enough diversion, but now I bid you return to the task at hand.${prompt}
  14000: My success is linked to your success, after all. And I have new targets for you to hunt.${prompt}
  14001: Yes...I can feel it. The Prime Weapons will soon be mine to wield...${prompt}
  14002: '${color-alt: 15}Elijah smiles at you.'
  14003: '${color-alt: 15}Elijah begins laughing boisterously!'
  14004: ${name-player}. I must confess, I thought you had forgotten about me.${prompt}
  14005: We are at our watershed moment. I promise to be brief.${prompt}
  14006: As you are eminently aware, Garazu-Horeizu is on the move.${prompt}
