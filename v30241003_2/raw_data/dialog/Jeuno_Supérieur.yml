  7113: Mais bon, vous les jeunes, vous avez tendance à jeter les créatures sans y penser. C’est pourquoi il y a plus de chocobos vivant dans la nature aujourd’hui que je n’aurais jamais cru possible quand j’étais gamin. Toi, tu ne ferais pas une chose aussi terrifiante, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7114: Tu ne peux pas me tromper. Je reconnais un bon gamin quand j’en vois un. Les yeux trahissent tout.${prompt}
  7115: Bien sûr que non !${prompt}
  7116: Pourtant, je ne peux pas t’autoriser à monter aussi facilement. La Société des Chocobos de Vana’diel ne le permettrait jamais.${prompt}
  7117: J’ai une idée… Tu vois cette belle créature là-bas ? Si elle s’entend avec toi, je te permettrai de la monter. Bonne chance, gamin.${prompt}
  7118: Le maître a trouvé ce chocobo effondré sur les champs de Rolanberry. Je parie qu’il a fui son dernier propriétaire.${prompt}
  7119: On dirait qu’il a été fouetté et travaillé jusqu’à l’épuisement. Il a tellement peur des gens qu’il se recroqueville devant tout le monde.${prompt}
  7120: Ces sauvages ! Ce n’est pas une façon de traiter un chocobo… Je fais de mon mieux pour lui, mais il ne mange rien.${prompt}
  7121: 'Mais je me demande… Il pourrait bien manger ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}. Tu sais, la nourriture qui guérit les blessures des chocobos.${prompt}'
  7122: Les chocobos aiment qu’on les nourrisse à la main. Tu vois ? Comme ça.${prompt}
  7123: Ils reconnaissent ton odeur après que tu les as nourris à la main chaque jour pendant longtemps.${prompt}
  7124: Petit à petit, tu gagnes leur confiance. Et tu découvres la personnalité de ton chocobo.${prompt}
  7125: Eh bien, sacré nom d’un chien ! T’es toujours là ? T’as pas ce qu’il faut, gamin. Dégage !${prompt}
  7126: Si ce chocobo s’entend avec toi, je te laisserai le monter.${prompt}
  7127: Ils ne mangent rien tant qu’ils ne commencent pas à te reconnaître. Continue comme ça, mon gars.${prompt}
  7128: Il a peur de toi. C’est comme ça avec les gens qu’ils ne connaissent pas.${prompt}
  7129: |-
    Kweh…
    (Il semble toujours terrifié par toi.)${prompt}
  7130: Ils ne mangent rien tant qu’ils ne sont pas à l’aise avec toi. Continue comme ça, d’accord ?${prompt}
  7131: |-
    Kweh…
    (Il semble toujours un peu méfiant envers toi.)${prompt}
  7132: Non, toujours rien. Un chocobo amical mangerait déjà, mais celui-ci est différent.${prompt}
  7133: |-
    Kweh !
    (Il semble encore légèrement mal à l’aise avec toi.)${prompt}
  7134: Wow, je pensais que ça prendrait plus de temps. Je crois qu’on l’a presque conquis !${prompt}
  7135: Eh bien, regarde ce qu’on a ici ! Il est déjà en train de manger. On dirait qu’il est presque prêt.${prompt}
  7136: Juste quand je pensais t’avoir perdu, je retrouve ta tête déplorable ici.${prompt}
  7137: Qui diable es-tu ? C’est pas poli de débarquer dans un enclos à chocobos, mon pote.${prompt}
  7138: Ne me parle pas comme ça, voleur. Je suis ici pour récupérer ce qui m’appartient de droit.${prompt}
  7139: On ne garde pas les voleurs ici, monsieur. Et je ne me souviens pas avoir pris quoi que ce soit à quelqu’un.${prompt}
  7140: Ce chocobo m’appartient. Tu ne vois pas la marque ? Alors rends-le-moi.${prompt}
  7141: Attends, ça veut dire… Maître, viens vite !${prompt}
  7142: Monsieur, vous êtes peut-être un éleveur de chocobos, mais je parie que vous les traitez brutalement !${prompt}
  7143: Et alors ? T’as un problème avec ça ? Gâte tes animaux et ils ne t’obéiront jamais.${prompt}
  7144: Faut leur instiller de la peur ! Je veux dire, allez… Ce ne sont que des animaux ! Toi, tu manges de la viande, non ?${prompt}
  7145: Alors ne me donne pas de leçons sur ce que je fais avec eux.${prompt}
  7146: Allez, on y va.${prompt}
  7147: Kweh !${prompt}
  7148: Lâche-le, monsieur ! Tu lui fais peur !${prompt}
  7149: Ouais ? Eh bien, c’est parce que tu l’as pourri !${prompt}
  7150: Je reviendrai chercher ce qui est à moi. Souviens-toi de mes mots !${prompt}
  7151: Ce genre de racaille, c’est le pire !${prompt}
  7152: Ah, bon. Ce n’est pas vraiment ton problème.${prompt}
  7153: Alors écoute, gamin… T’as du talent. Ce petit oiseau est presque à toi. Continue comme ça, d’accord ?${prompt}
  7154: Ah, ce brute ne me fait pas peur. De toute façon… regarde-toi ! Le maître a dit que tu avais du talent ! Je suis tellement jaloux.${prompt}
  7155: 'T’as ce qu’il faut, gamin. Alors je suis sûr qu’il va finir par t’apprécier. Continue comme ça et tu auras ton ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} en un rien de temps.${prompt}'
  7156: On dirait qu’il est habitué à toi. Il n’a plus du tout peur maintenant.${prompt}
  7157: |-
    Kweh !
    (Il semble être à l’aise avec toi.)${prompt}
  7158: Encore un petit peu ! Grâce à toi, il mange plus, et ses plumes ont une brillance plus saine !${prompt}
  7159: |-
    Kweh !
    (Il mange joyeusement.)${prompt}
  7160: Hah ! Je ne l’ai jamais entendu couiner aussi joyeusement !${prompt}
  7161: 'Oh, désolé. Il ne mangera pas ${item-plural: 6[2]}. Mais il pourrait aimer ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  7162: 'Je suis désolé. À part l’heure du repas, le maître nous gronde quand on leur donne ${item-plural: 6[2]}. Je sais… C’est l’intention qui compte.${prompt}'
  7163: Eh bien, on dirait qu’il est habitué à toi maintenant !${prompt}
  7164: Bien joué ! Maintenant, tu es un cavalier de chocobo qualifié.${prompt}
  7165: Maintenant que tu peux lire dans les pensées des animaux, peut-être que tu peux devenir un maître des bêtes. Bien sûr, je ne peux pas t’apprendre comment… Tu devras t’entraîner.${prompt}
  7166: Le reste dépend de toi, gamin. Pour l’instant, prends ça aux écuries.${prompt}
  7167: Le reste dépend de toi, gamin. Pour l’instant, prends ça aux écuries.${prompt}
  7168: Le maître était vraiment profond en parlant de lire leurs pensées… Au moins, on sait que le dernier propriétaire n’avait pas ce don !${prompt} 
  7169: Le maître était vraiment profond en parlant de lire leurs pensées… Au moins, on sait que le dernier propriétaire n’avait pas ce don !${prompt}
  7170: Si tu peux lire dans leurs pensées, tu as peut-être ce qu’il faut pour être un maître des bêtes. Mais aucun enseignement ne pourra t’aider là-dessus… Non, non !${prompt}
  7171: En y réfléchissant, je me demande ce qu’est devenu ce lâche d’éleveur de chocobos ?${prompt}
  7172: Oh, tu n’as pas entendu ? Il est resté chez lui pour s’occuper de son fils depuis qu’il est tombé malade.${prompt}
  7173: Eh bien, c’est ce qu’il mérite pour avoir maltraité ses chocobos. Bien fait pour lui !${prompt}
  7174: De quoi tu parles ? Il était incontrôlable, mais son pauvre petit garçon n’a jamais fait de mal à personne !${prompt}
  7175: Ouais. Tu as raison. J’ai entendu dire que son gamin était choqué par ce que faisait son père, aussi.${prompt}
  7176: Peut-être que si ce brute était plus doux avec ses chocobos, son fils irait mieux. Qu’en penses-tu ?${prompt}
  7177: Eh bien, regarde de qui tu parles. Je ne pense même pas que ce soit possible… Ça me fait de la peine pour le gamin, par contre.${prompt}
  7178: Kweh !${prompt}
  7179: Aw, qu’est-ce qui ne va pas ?${prompt}
  7180: C’était un piaillement triste. Pourquoi es-tu si déprimé tout d’un coup ?${prompt}
  7181: Ha-ha ! Il est tellement docile maintenant.${prompt}
  7182: J’aimerais le voir partir, mais peut-être que l’envoyer ailleurs serait ce qu’il y a de mieux pour lui.${prompt} 
  7183: Il s’est juste levé et a couru. On était tellement inquiets. Il est revenu tout couvert de boue. Mais je me demande où il est allé ?${prompt}
  7184: Eh bien, salut ! Comment vas-tu, hein ? Tu as l’air en pleine forme ! Alors, que puis-je…${prompt}
  7185: Maître !${prompt}
  7186: 'Hé, tu penses que tu es… ${wait-animation: 2}${prompt}'
  7187: Regarde, il a peur de toi !${prompt}
  7188: Attends… Il est content de quelque chose. Qu’est-ce que cela pourrait signifier ?${prompt}
  7189: Te voilà… Merci ! C’est grâce à toi que mon fils a récupéré.${prompt}
  7190: Je t’ai battu et fouetté pendant si longtemps. Pourquoi as-tu décidé de m’aider ?${prompt}
  7191: Tu me comprends ? Non, je ne te remercierai jamais assez pour tout ce que tu as fait pour moi. Je te remercie sincèrement.${prompt}
  7192: Et toi aussi ! Merci.${prompt}
  7193: Je ne suis plus maître des bêtes. Mais je parie que tu peux devenir un grand maître des bêtes si tu continues ainsi.${prompt}
  7194: Et je suis désolé d’avoir dit ces choses-là avant.${prompt}
  7195: Hé, ne t’en fais pas.${prompt}
  7196: Je ne suis plus digne des chocobos. S’il te plaît, prends soin de lui pour moi.${prompt}
  7197: Tu peux compter sur moi. Il va grandir fort et en bonne santé.${prompt}
  7198: Reste là.${prompt}
  7199: Marque bien mes mots. Un jour, il reviendra chercher son chocobo.${prompt}
  7200: Et le chocobo ira volontiers avec lui. Après tout, c’est un maître des bêtes.${prompt}
  7201: Tout est bien qui finit bien, non ? Maintenant, tu peux te dire maître des bêtes. Tiens-toi droit, gamin !${prompt}
  7202: Tu peux maintenant devenir un maître des bêtes.${prompt}
  7203: Ah, mec ! Moi aussi, je veux devenir maître des bêtes un jour !${prompt}
  7204: Quoi ? Oh, le gamin de ce gars s’est amélioré ? Eh bien, c’est une bonne nouvelle. J’aimerais bien l’inviter chez moi un jour.${prompt}
  7205: On dirait que personne n’est à la maison.${prompt}
  7206: Salut, Galmut !${prompt}
  7207: Hé, Collet ! Reste là. J’ai presque fini !${prompt}
  7208: D’accord !${prompt}
  7209: L’horloge est toujours précise, grâce à Galmut. Il huile les engrenages chaque jour.${prompt}
  7210: Ouf… Alors, comment vas-tu ? Tu vas toujours à l’école, non ?${prompt}
  7211: Euh, ouais… Plus ou moins.${prompt}
  7212: Plus ou moins ? Qu’est-ce que ça veut dire ? On dirait que tu fais l’école buissonnière !${prompt}
  7213: Ouais… Mais ta voix me fait toujours sourire.${prompt}
  7214: C’est vrai ? Eh bien, l’enfance, ce n’est pas que des études. N’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7215: ★★★★★★La cloche sonne★★★★★★${prompt}
  7216: Elle est pile à l’heure ! Heh, c’est moi qui m’occupe de cette horloge.${prompt}
  7217: Au début, c’était un travail ennuyeux, mais maintenant je vois à quel point c’est vraiment amusant.${prompt}
  7218: Cette horloge nécessite beaucoup d’attention, sinon elle sonne immédiatement. C’est une créature si délicate.${prompt}
  7219: Chaque fois que je l’entends sonner, j’ai l’impression d’avoir réveillé cette ville.${prompt}
  7220: Chaque jour, je vois les mêmes gens passer pendant que je nettoie les engrenages, et ils s’arrêtent pour dire bonjour.${prompt}
  7221: Parfois, quand je n’en vois pas un, je commence à m’inquiéter s’ils vont bien.${prompt}
  7222: J’avais un œil sur une certaine fille…${prompt}
  7223: Jusqu’au jour où je l’ai vue avec un autre gars. Mec, ça m’a fait mal.${prompt}
  7224: Enfin, peu importe… Plus je travaillais, plus j’avais l’impression d’aider tout le monde. Ça me rendait heureux.${prompt}
  7225: Je m’amuse trop, non ?${prompt}
  7226: Ouais, beaucoup trop !${prompt}
  7227: Hé, je ne te posais pas la question.${prompt}
  7228: Eh bien, je ferais bien de rentrer bientôt. Prends soin de toi !${prompt}
  7229: Ravi de t’avoir rencontré. À demain !${prompt}
  7230: Galmut travaille sur l’horloge. Ne le dérange pas.${prompt}
  7231: J’ai trop peur de l’école. J’ai dit à Galmut que je pensais que tout le monde me détestait. Mais il a dit que ce n’était pas possible.${prompt}
  7232: Oh, c’est toi… Désolé, mais je suis en plein milieu de quelque chose. Pourrais-tu revenir plus tard ?${prompt}
  7233: Eh bien, regarde qui voilà ! Bienvenue dans mon humble demeure.${prompt}
  7234: J’ai plein de trucs bizarres, non ?${prompt}
  7235: Heh. Ce sont peut-être des déchets, mais ce sont toutes des choses précieuses qu’une certaine personne m’a données.${prompt}
  7236: Hé, qu’est-ce que tu fais ? C’est mon lit !${prompt}
  7237: Y a-t-il quelqu’un à la maison ?${prompt}
  7238: Eh bien, parle du loup… C’est M. Narihira !${prompt}
  7239: Je vois que tu tiens toujours le coup.${prompt}
  7240: Hah ! Vous les jeunes d’après-guerre, vous n’avez rien sur ma génération !${prompt}
  7241: Eh bien, c’est bon de te voir.${prompt}
  7242: Comment va l’horloge, Galmut ?${prompt}
  7243: Je m’en occupe bien. Ne me dis pas que tu ne l’entends pas sonner !${prompt}
  7244: Hein ? Qu’est-ce que tu as dit ? Je rigole. Bien sûr que je l’entends très bien !${prompt}
  7245: Mais j’entends les engrenages qui ont du mal. Peut-être qu’il est temps de lui mettre un peu d’huile.${prompt}
  7246: Eh bien, tu n’as pas changé d’un pouce !${prompt}
  7247: Et je vois que tu as un ami ici !${prompt}
  7248: Écoute, gamin. Galmut est un citoyen modèle maintenant, mais avant, c’était un vrai voyou !${prompt}
  7249: Oh non, pas encore ça !${prompt}
  7250: Ohohoho ! Défensif, hein ? Quoi qu’il en soit, Galmut est arrivé à Jeuno il y a environ trois ans…${prompt}
  7251: Il est venu dans la grande ville pour marquer son territoire. Il a travaillé tous les jours du matin au soir !${prompt}
  7252: Et quand j’ai enfin eu assez de fric pour ouvrir mon propre magasin…${prompt}
  7253: Je me suis fait arnaquer. J’ai tout perdu…${prompt}
  7254: Et ça l’a vraiment secoué ! Il a perdu foi en l’humanité… en grognant sur tout le monde comme un chien affamé.${prompt}
  7255: C’est à ce moment-là que M. Narihira m’a proposé un emploi à la tour de l’horloge.${prompt}
  7256: Au début, je pensais que c’était juste un autre arnaqueur. Mais une fois que j’ai commencé, j’ai vraiment apprécié.${prompt}
  7257: Tu sais, on travaille tellement dur là-dedans que, quand on entend enfin la cloche sonner… Mec, ça résonne jusqu’au cœur !${prompt} 
  7258: Et j’étais content de trouver quelqu’un qui continuerait à ma place.${prompt}
  7259: Oh ouais… J’avais presque oublié !${prompt}
  7260: 'Il nous faut ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}. Et avec les bêtes en furie, le magasin est presque à sec.${prompt}'
  7261: Non mais vraiment ? Sans huile, nous…${prompt}
  7262: Peut-être que le Tenshodo en a encore. Mais je déteste faire des affaires avec eux.${prompt}
  7263: 'Moi aussi… Hé, je sais ! Tu voudrais bien nous apporter ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} ?${prompt}'
  7264: Nous te serions tellement reconnaissants. C’est une machine si délicate… Sans ça, j’ai peur qu’elle ne parte en vrille !${prompt}

    Les aideras-tu ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Pas maintenant.${prompt}
  7266: D'accord ! Merci beaucoup !${prompt}
  7267: D'abord, va au Tenshodo, ici à Jeuno.${prompt}
  7268: Oh, vraiment ? Eh bien, dis-moi si tu changes d'avis. On doit faire quelque chose.${prompt}
  7269: 'Oh, c''est toi. On n''a toujours pas trouvé ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  7270: M. Narihira a dit que le Tenshodo en a. Sans ça, tôt ou tard les engrenages vont s'arrêter !${prompt}
  7271: Qui est là !?${prompt}
  7272: Oh, toi... Merci d'avoir apporté l'huile, mais on n'en a plus besoin !${prompt}
  7273: J'ai entendu dire qu'ils allaient la démolir pour en faire une grue pour soulever des cargaisons des navires.${prompt}
  7274: Le plan est déjà passé. Y'a plus rien à faire maintenant !${prompt}
  7275: 'Eh bien, je vais prendre ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. Merci d’avoir essayé, ${choice-player-gender}[pote/ami]. C''est pour toi.${prompt}'
  7276: J'essaie de croire en quelque chose, et voilà ce qui arrive !${prompt}
  7277: Galmut, c'est moi ! T'es là ?${prompt}
  7278: Oh, c'est toi. Où est Galmut ?${prompt}
  7279: Il est sorti, hein ? Et il a entendu parler de l'horloge ? Il a dû être choqué.${prompt}
  7280: 'C''est Galmut, ça. Regarde, si on récolte suffisamment de signatures avec ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, on pourrait peut-être arrêter le plan !${prompt}'
  7281: 'Ils vont démonter l’horloge. Narihira a dit qu’on pouvait obtenir ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} à la Chambre de Commerce et d’Industrie, mais je ne sais pas ce qu’il veut dire.${prompt}'
  7282: Galmut était tellement choqué. Mais je peux rien faire. C'est lui qui me remonte toujours le moral.${prompt}
  7283: Galmut ne sortira pas, peu importe combien je l'appelle. Je me demande ce qu'il a...${prompt}
  7284: Mais l'horloge semble fonctionner correctement. Je me demande qui la maintient en marche... C'est l'une des sept merveilles de Jeuno !${prompt}
  7285: Hein ? Tu veux que je signe ? Si ça aide Galmut, bien sûr !${prompt}
  7286: Qu'est-ce que c'est ?${prompt}
  7287: Quoi !? Tu...${prompt}
  7288: J'ai entendu dire que quelqu'un avait lancé une pétition. Mais c'était toi ? Galmut devrait être heureux d'avoir un ami comme toi.${prompt}
  7289: Je me demande où il a bien pu aller. C'est pathétique !${prompt}

  7291: M. Narihira... Et toi... Que fais-tu ici ?${prompt}
  7292: Tais-toi et écoute pour une fois ! Ton ami a réuni tellement de signatures que la pétition pour sauver la tour de l'horloge a réussi !${prompt}
  7293: Hein ? Pétition ? Ça veut dire que les engrenages vont continuer à tourner ?${prompt}
  7294: Bien sûr, idiot ! En ce moment, c'est toi qui es l'horloge arrêtée.${prompt}
  7295: Tu sais ce que ça veut dire, n'est-ce pas ? Plus de sonneries retentissantes. Tu me suis, gamin ?${prompt}
  7296: M. Narihira... Je suis désolé.${prompt}
  7297: Enfer, je me fiche de ce que tu ressens !${prompt}

  7299: 'Ugh...${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'

  7301: Oh, je vais bien. J'ai juste gardé l'horloge en marche pendant ton absence. Et, mon dieu, j'étais plus rouillé qu'elle !${prompt}
  7302: Je ne sais pas comment te remercier. Personne ne s'est jamais soucié de me parler franchement.${prompt}
  7303: Ah ! Quel genre d'idiot aime se faire engueuler !?${prompt}
  7304: En plus, je pense qu'il y a quelqu'un d'autre que tu devrais remercier. Ton horloge précieuse serait à la ferraille sans ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle].${prompt}

  7312: Oh, c'est toi, hein ? Galmut travaille plus dur que jamais, grâce à toi. Fais-moi une faveur et viens prendre de ses nouvelles de temps en temps, d'accord ?${prompt}

  7333: Tout le monde dit qu'elle est sous une sorte de malédiction. Albrecht prie au temple chaque jour, espérant un soulagement.${prompt}

  7353: Pas vraiment de changement. Je me demande... As-tu vu quelque chose d'étrange lorsque vous êtes partis pique-niquer tous les deux ?${prompt}
  7354: Non, rien du tout.${prompt}
  7355: Je pense qu'elle va aller mieux.${prompt}
  7356: Oui, je l'espère aussi.${prompt}
  7357: Eh bien, essaie de garder le moral !${prompt}
  7358: D'accord ?${prompt}
  7359: Hmm... Il doit bien y avoir quelque chose que je puisse faire !${prompt}
  7360: |-
    Si seulement je savais quoi faire...
    Si jamais tu trouves un remède pour ma sœur, fais-le-moi savoir.${prompt}
  7361: Oh, tu penses que cela pourrait la guérir ? J’ai entendu dire que cet endroit est terrible, alors sois très, très prudent. Je prierai pour ta sécurité !${prompt}
  7362: Quoi ? Cela pourrait être un remède ? Merci beaucoup ! Maintenant, dépêche-toi !${prompt}
  7363: Très bien... Audia, tu iras mieux en un rien de temps !${prompt}
  7364: Attends, Baudin ! Ce n’est pas un remède. Cela va empirer son état !${prompt}
  7365: Albrecht ? Et Alista... Comment le sais-tu ?${prompt}
  7366: Ma sœur me l’a dit.${prompt}
  7367: J-Je suis tellement désolé. Je savais comment guérir sa maladie.${prompt}
  7368: Q-Quoi !? Que se passe-t-il ?${prompt}
  7369: Quand nous sommes sortis ce jour-là, j’ai vu un fantôme venir la posséder. Je savais que nous devions l’exorciser...${prompt}
  7370: Je suis tellement désolé. Je ne voulais pas perdre mon frère à cause d’elle.${prompt}
  7371: C’est pourquoi je me suis tu. J’espérais que si Audia ne guérissait jamais, alors mon frère abandonnerait un jour.${prompt}
  7372: Mais j’avais tort. Il l’aime vraiment, profondément. Maintenant, je le sais.${prompt}
  7373: Et je ne pouvais plus voir Audia souffrir. S’il te plaît, pardonne-moi !${prompt}
  7374: Je...${prompt}
  7375: Baudin, je veux que tu nous pardonnes tous les deux. Je savais qu’Alista détestait Audia, mais je ne soupçonnais rien.${prompt}
  7376: Même si tu ne nous pardonnes pas, s’il te plaît, donne-lui ceci maintenant !${prompt}
  7377: Qu’est-ce que c’est ? Et comment...?${prompt}
  7378: Cela devrait chasser l’esprit. Les monstres m’ont blessé là-bas, mais ma douleur n’est rien comparée à ce qu’Audia a souffert.${prompt}
  7379: Albrecht, Alista... C’est bon. Je vous crois.${prompt}
  7380: Audia, Albrecht a bravé les dangers pour trouver un remède pour toi. Maintenant, je veux que tu fasses un effort et que tu guérisses !${prompt}
  7381: Ngraarrr ! Maudits soyez-vous tous ! Vous l’avez trouvé !? URRRNGAHHH !!!${prompt}
  7382: Uhh... Ouf...${prompt}
  7383: Hein !? Où suis-je... Oh, je suis chez moi ? Qu’est-ce qui m’est arrivé ?${prompt}
  7384: Audia !${prompt}
  7385: Baudin, que se passe-t-il ? Allons, allons... Ne pleure pas.${prompt}
  7386: Ma chère Audia... Tout va bien. Tout est fini.${prompt}
  7387: Audia !${prompt}
  7388: Que faites-vous tous ici ? Je ne me souviens de rien !${prompt}
  7389: Pardonne-moi ! S’il te plaît, pardonne-moi !${prompt}
  7390: Alista, n’aie pas peur. Juste parce qu’ils se marient, cela ne veut pas dire que tu te retrouveras seule tout d’un coup.${prompt}
  7391: Quoi ?${prompt}
  7392: Tu viendras vivre avec nous, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7393: Attends... Tu vas vraiment pardonner ce que j’ai fait ?${prompt}
  7394: Bien sûr ! Je pense comprendre ce que tu ressens.${prompt}
  7395: Je suis tellement désolé, Audia. Je n’aurais jamais dû laisser cela t’arriver.${prompt}
  7396: Baudin...${prompt}
  7397: Et toi, étranger. Je te remercie.${prompt}
  7398: J’ai simplement refusé d’affronter la réalité. J’ai honte...${prompt}
  7399: J’ai oublié que nous devons d’abord faire ce que nous sommes capables de faire, avant de demander l’aide divine.${prompt}
  7400: Il y a des moments où nous devons agir, même face à l’adversité.${prompt}
  7401: Par la prière, nous gagnons la force et l’espoir de continuer. Mais ensuite, il faut agir !${prompt}
  7402: Ceci est pour toi. Pour avoir essayé d’aider Audia, et pour m’avoir fait réaliser la vérité. Utilise-le bien !${prompt}
  7403: Baudin, laisse-moi m’occuper d’Audia maintenant. Je ne laisserai jamais une telle chose lui arriver à nouveau. Je le promets !${prompt}
  7404: S’il te plaît, Baudin. Je t’en supplie !${prompt}
  7405: Non, ce n’est rien ! Je sais que tu peux bien t’occuper d’elle.${prompt}
  7406: Merci, Baudin.${prompt}
  7407: Audia...${prompt}
  7408: Oh, Albrecht...${prompt}
  7409: On dirait qu’elle va bien maintenant. Merci de nous avoir aidés. Cela faisait une éternité que je ne l’avais pas vue sourire.${prompt}
  7410: Quoi ? La tour de l’horloge !? Galmut m’a une fois montré l’intérieur. C’était sombre, sale et ça sentait l’huile, mais Galmut la connaissait de fond en comble.${prompt}
  7411: 'Bien sûr que je signerai ! Aussi, voici un secret : Galmut avait un faible pour ma sœur !${prompt}'
  7412: Oh, bonjour. Vous ne trouverez rien ici sauf des souvenirs d’un autre temps. Les jeunes gens pleins de vie comme vous mourraient probablement d’ennui !${prompt}
  7413: Bonjour. Je viens toujours aider Ilumida. Elle a des problèmes de dos et ne peut vraiment plus vivre seule.${prompt}
  7414: La guerre est peut-être terminée, mais la douleur est éternelle. Ilumida a perdu son mari, et des gens comme elle souffrent chaque jour.${prompt}
  7415: Jeuno semble être un endroit animé, mais regardez de plus près et vous trouverez des cicatrices persistantes. La guerre est vraiment une chose terrible.${prompt}
  7416: Oh, un visiteur ? Que puis-je faire pour vous ?${prompt}
  7417: Je cherche Ilumida. Est-elle ici ?${prompt}
  7418: Je me demande qui cela pourrait être. Excusez-moi, s’il vous plaît.${prompt}
  7419: Pourquoi, c’est Wolfgang ! Entrez, entrez.${prompt}
  7420: Je suis content de voir que vous allez bien. Tenez, laissez-moi vous donner le paiement de ce mois-ci.${prompt}
  7421: Merci, comme toujours, Wolfgang. Vous savez à quel point je vous suis reconnaissante.${prompt}
  7422: Non, c’est ce que mon père voulait.${prompt}
  7423: Je l’apprécie vraiment, cependant. Que diriez-vous d’un verre ? J’ai du bon thé aujourd’hui.${prompt}
  7424: Merci, Ilumida, mais je dois y aller. Peut-être que plus tard, j’aurai le temps de vous rendre visite.${prompt}
  7425: Oh ? C’est dommage. Eh bien, prenez soin de vous, Wolfgang !${prompt}
  7426: Toujours à votre service, madame.${prompt}
  7427: Le père de Wolfgang, Brandolf, était aussi un soldat. Il s’est battu pour la liberté de Jeuno bien avant le règne de l’archiduc.${prompt}
  7428: Et mon mari a servi sous ses ordres. Mais dans les guerres qui ont suivi... Quand il avait à peu près l’âge de Wolfgang...${prompt}
  7429: Son père, Brandolf, est mort des blessures qu’il a reçues au combat. Avant de mourir, il a ordonné que des fonds soient versés à des gens comme moi.${prompt}
  7430: Eh bien, qui suis-je pour donner une leçon à un étranger ? Je suis désolée.${prompt}
  7431: Bon, je suppose que je dois maintenant aller donner l’information.${prompt}
  7432: Je pensais qu’il y avait une bougie ici...${prompt}
  7433: Oh, mon dieu... Il semble que je n’ai plus de bougies !${prompt}
  7434: Pourriez-vous aller au temple et en chercher une pour moi ? À mon âge, même de courtes marches me laissent complètement essoufflée.${prompt}

  7438: Je pense que le Temple de la Déesse devrait avoir des bougies. Je sais que c’est embêtant, mais pourriez-vous aller en chercher une ?${prompt}
  7439: Oh, splendide. Maintenant je peux le dire à mon mari. Et pour vous, voici un petit quelque chose pour votre peine.${prompt}
  7440: Ce n’est pas grand-chose, mais je crois que cela veillera sur vous en cas de besoin. Allez, ne soyez pas timide... Prenez-le !${prompt}
  7441: Cela fait si longtemps que mon mari est mort à la guerre. Cette maison était petite pour nous deux, et elle semble toujours si grande rien qu’avec moi.${prompt}
  7442: Eh bien, n’hésitez pas à passer si vous êtes dans le quartier. J’ai toujours une théière prête pour recevoir des invités.${prompt}
  7443: Et merci beaucoup. Mon mari doit être très content. Ne soyez pas un étranger, d’accord ?${prompt}
  7444: Ha ! Vous perdez votre temps !${prompt}
  7445: J’aide Verena et Fickie à faire pousser des fleurs. On les arrose tous les jours. J’espère vraiment qu’elles fleuriront bientôt !${prompt}
  7446: Ouais, c’est ça. Jamais les graines des hommes-bêtes ne pousseront.${prompt}
  7447: Nan ! Elles pousseront !${prompt}
  7448: Ouais ! Mon papa a dit que les hommes-bêtes allaient déclencher une nouvelle guerre ! Fickie est l’ennemi !${prompt}
  7449: Nan ! Fickie est notre ami !${prompt}
  7450: Fickie nous a dit que quand elles fleuriront, cela voudra dire que les gens et les "bébêtes" peuvent être amis. J’ai été surpris d’entendre ça, surtout venant d’un gobbie-wobbie !${prompt}
  7451: Je sais qu’elles fleuriront. Je vais y arriver.${prompt}
  7452: Juste pour te montrer qu’elles vont se faner et mourir.${prompt}
  7453: Salut, Fickie ! Salut, Verena !${prompt}
  7454: Alors, toujours pas de pousse, hein ?${prompt}
  7455: Oui, je sais, c’est vraiment décevant. Pourtant, je les arrose tous les jours !${prompt}
  7456: Elles ne pousseront jamais.${prompt}
  7457: Arrose-les autant que tu veux. Les graines de Fickie ne pousseront jamais ici, à Jeuno. Jamais !${prompt}
  7458: Regarde, pourquoi tu ne te tais pas ! On ne sait jamais tant qu’on n’a pas essayé.${prompt}
  7459: Oh ! T’es toujours du côté de Fickie, pas vrai ?${prompt}
  7460: Je pense qu’elles vont pousser.${prompt}
  7461: Hein ?${prompt}
  7462: Tout le monde me parle maintenant que je les ai plantées. Ça me rend si heureux.${prompt}
  7463: Alors, même si les fleurs ne fleurissent jamais, c’était quand même bien.${prompt}
  7464: Fickie...${prompt}
  7465: Peu importe !${prompt}
  7466: Je dois retourner chez Muck. Je vous vois demain.${prompt}
  7467: Prends soin de toi, Fickblix. Moi aussi, je rentre à la maison.${prompt}
  7468: J’espère qu’elles pousseront demain ! Bye !${prompt}
  7469: Merci pour tout.${prompt}
  7470: Et merci d’avoir apporté l’engrais, Geebeh.${prompt}
  7471: Peu importe ! Ce n’est pas pour toi que je le fais.${prompt}
  7472: Depuis que Fickie est parti, je ne vois plus Verena dans le coin. Même les gars du Tenshodo ne me parlent plus.${prompt}
  7473: C’est un lâche ! Il s’est enfui avant que les fleurs n’aient eu le temps de fleurir ! Ce n’est pas juste !${prompt}
  7474: Je te dis de pousser ! Vous êtes nos fleurs ! À nous et à Fickie ! Alors poussez, nom d’un chien !${prompt}
  7475: Attends, Geebeh. Regarde-moi ça !${prompt}
  7476: Oh, quoi encore ? C’est... une pousse ? Ça pousse ?${prompt}
  7477: Exactement, Geebeh ! On ne peut pas le voir juste en regardant, mais ça commence à pousser sous la terre !${prompt}
  7478: On a planté ces graines ! Nous et Fickie ! Et maintenant elles poussent !${prompt}
  7479: Donne ça à Verena. Dis-lui que les fleurs que nous avons plantées avec Fickie commencent à pousser !${prompt}

  7604: Ah ! Ce Panta est encore en train d'essayer... Eh bien, je m'en fiche. Il ne me battra jamais avec ce genre de trucs !${prompt}
  7605: Oh, ouais. Les Gobelins portaient le Cardian de Panta chez le médecin. Je me demande ce qui se passe...${prompt}
  7606: Panta ne pleure jamais après avoir perdu un combat, mais il pleurait en sortant du médecin. Peut-être qu'il avait une carie ?${prompt}

  7615: Regardez ! La structure résidentielle de Jeuno s'élève au-dessus de la ville ! Sans elle, où logeraient tous les visiteurs de Jeuno ?${prompt}
  7616: Au sommet se trouvent les jardins de Ru'Lude, le Palais Auroral et les ambassades. Cet endroit inspire une grande admiration !${prompt}
  7617: Vous vérifiez toujours la marchandise avant de décider quoi fabriquer, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7618: Mais à Jeuno, vous pouvez acheter des marchandises de partout, à tout moment ! Moi, je finis toujours par tout vérifier !${prompt}
  7619: Le maître de cette écurie de chocobos est célèbre ! C'est un honneur de monter un oiseau ici.${prompt}
  7620: J'aimerais avoir un des chocobos pour moi, mais le maître est têtu ! Je me demande s'il dira un jour oui.${prompt}
  7621: J'oublie souvent que nous vivons au-dessus de l'océan. Il y a longtemps, ces ponts n'étaient que des ruines. Je ne sais pas comment les voyageurs faisaient à l'époque.${prompt}

  7627: Je vais rester éveillé toute la nuit à réfléchir à ça !${prompt}
  7628: Je décharge les cargaisons des navires avec ces grues et je les transporte dans l'entrepôt.${prompt}

  7632: J'ai accumulé mon gil pendant longtemps, et le moment est venu d'acheter ! Mais devrais-je acheter des armes ou des armures ?${prompt}
  7633: La meilleure défense est peut-être une bonne attaque, mais un chevalier sans armure est vite abattu. Hmm... Que choisir...${prompt}

  8155: C’est à force de manier ta hache ?${prompt}
  8156: C’est plutôt impressionnant, mais je ne pense pas que tu puisses égaler mon patron là-bas. Il a dressé nos chocobos et construit cette écurie tout entière, rien qu’avec une seule hache.${prompt}
  8157: Eh bien, il pourrait terrasser les monstres les plus redoutables d’un seul coup !${prompt}
  8158: Osker ! Arrête de bavarder et retourne au travail ! Nos chocobos meurent de faim là dehors !${prompt}

    Tu sais, tu as raison…

  8163: Il a dit qu’il s’intéressait au commerce des haches, mais qu’il ne savait pas encore lesquelles vendre dans sa boutique. Il m’a demandé de tester deux nouveaux modèles… mais j’ai déjà assez à faire avec les écuries, et pas le temps de jouer à trancher et découper.${prompt}

  8165: |-
    Alors, qu’en dis-tu ?
    ${selection-lines}
    D’accord, je vais t’aider.

  8168: Oui, tu as l’air d’un(e) ${choice-player-gender}[homme/femme] occupé(e). On ne peut pas attendre de quelqu’un qu’il aide sans rien en retour…${prompt}

  8170: |-
    Que veux-tu ?
    ${selection-lines}
    J’ai perdu le ${item-singular: 1[2]}.
    J’en ai assez de tester la hache.
    Rien du tout.${prompt}
  8171: Quoi ? Tu l’as perdu ? Eh bien, le type du Tenshodo m’a donné une caisse pleine de ces haches, alors peu m’importe si tu les utilises pour tondre les moustaches de ton chat.${prompt}
  8172: Tiens, prends-en une autre. Mais tu sais que ça veut dire repartir de zéro, hein ?${prompt} 
  8173: Ne me dis pas que tu laisses tomber ? Allez, voyons. J’ai du boulot par-dessus la tête, et pas beaucoup d’âmes charitables pour aider un vieux cow-boy comme moi.${prompt}
  8174: |-
    Tu veux vraiment abandonner ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui
    Non${prompt}
  8175: Je savais que je pouvais compter sur toi, ${name-player}. Maintenant, sors et va trancher ! Prends ton temps si tu es pris par tes autres aventures.${prompt}
  8176: Mon gars, vous les jeunes d’aujourd’hui, aucun respect. Tu donnes ta parole à quelqu’un, et puis tu te rétractes comme si ça n’avait aucune importance.${prompt}
  8177: Je suppose que je vais devoir trouver quelqu’un d’autre pour m’aider. Maintenant, prends ta hache et dégage.${prompt}
  8178: Je sais pas… Je pense pas pouvoir encore me décider. Tranche encore quelques monstres, puis ramène-la-moi pour que je jette un autre coup d’œil.${prompt}
  8179: Eh bien, j’en crois pas mes yeux ! T’as tellement usé cette hache que je pourrais taper Osker sur la tête avec et il aurait même pas une égratignure. Maintenant, je crois que je peux décider quelle hache recommander au Tenshodo.${prompt}
  8180: À vrai dire, ${name-player}, je pensais pas que t’arriverais à réussir ce test. Je suis vraiment impressionné. Pour te montrer ma vraie gratitude, que dirais-tu de mettre tes talents de manieur de hache à une vraie épreuve ?${prompt}
  8181: Quand j’étais encore un jeune fougueux, mes camarades et moi, on aimait se mesurer pour savoir qui était le plus costaud du groupe. Ça n’avait pas vraiment de sens, mais c’était amusant et ça nous donnait confiance sur le champ de bataille.${prompt} 
  8182: Et après quelques-unes de ces séances, je sentais mes compétences s’affiner de plus en plus, jusqu’à ce que je puisse écraser tout ce qui croisait mon chemin.${prompt}
  8183: 'Tiens, prends ce ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} et va au Temple d’Uggalepih. Une fois là-bas, trouve ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}. Ramène-le-moi, et ce sera réglé. Ça a l’air simple, mais prépare-toi bien. J’ai vu plus d’un ami se faire rosser par la bête qui vit là-dedans.${prompt}'
  8184: 'Prends ce ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} et va au Temple d’Uggalepih. Trouve ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} et ramène-le-moi… mais fais gaffe, compris ?${prompt}'
  8185: Ha ha ! Toi, sacré gaillard ! Je vois à ton sourire que t’as botté les fesses de ce monstre !${prompt}
  8186: 'Mais assez parlé ! Voyons ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  8187: Ouah ! J’aimerais être aussi fort que toi et mon patron un jour ! Non, un jour, je serai aussi fort que toi. Tu verras bien !${prompt} 
  8188: '… Je te tire mon chapeau, ${name-player}.${prompt}'
  8189: Tant qu’il y aura des ${choice-player-gender}[hommes/femmes] tenaces comme toi à Vana’diel, pas de souci à se faire pour les bêtes ou les Seigneurs des Ombres.${prompt}
  8190: Bon, il est temps de retourner au boulot. Osker ! Arrête de traîner !${prompt}
  8191: Encore du travail ? J’aurai jamais le temps de m’entraîner avec ma hache !${prompt}
  8192: Oh, arrête de râler. Un de mes amis devrait arriver d’une minute à l’autre.${prompt}
  8193: Un ami ? Ouah, je savais pas que t’avais des amis, patron.${prompt}
  8194: Tu ferais mieux de fermer ton clapet, Osker, ou je vais te le sceller !${prompt}
  8195: Salut, Brutus. J’ai ramené la hache que tu m’avais demandé de tester. C’est une belle pièce, mais la tête est un peu trop lourde à mon goût.${prompt}
  8196: Au fait, Brutus, tu te souviens quel jour on est aujourd’hui ?${prompt}
  8197: Quel jour ? Bien sûr que je m’en souviens ! Un coup d’œil au calendrier là-bas et…${prompt}
  8198: Ne me dis pas que t’as oublié que c’était aujourd’hui que tu devais me laisser monter mon vieux chocobo ?${prompt}
  8199: |-
    Ha ha ha ! Je t’ai bien eu, hein ? Bien sûr que je m’en souviens.
    Tu as fait du bon boulot avec cette petite. Tout le monde ici aux écuries n’arrête pas de dire qu’elle est la plus facile à gérer.${prompt}
  8200: Les aventuriers aussi ! Ils disent que c’est le chocobo le plus obéissant qu’ils aient jamais monté.${prompt}
  8201: Hé hé. Ils n’ont pas dit ça, si ?${prompt}
  8202: Est-ce que je te mentirais ? Tu es devenu un sacré dompteur de bêtes, si tu veux mon avis.${prompt}
  8203: Ses blessures ne sont pas encore complètement guéries, mais je pense qu’une petite balade autour du duché ne lui ferait pas de mal. Vas-y !${prompt}
  8204: Encore merci, Brutus.${prompt}
  8205: Mais tu sais… je m’inquiète encore qu’elle ne me fasse pas assez confiance pour que je la monte… après tout ce que je lui ai fait traverser…${prompt}
  8206: Tu t’inquiètes encore pour ça ? Allez, regarde ses yeux.${prompt}
  8207: Ils brillent aussi fort que les tiens, Dietmund.${prompt}
  8208: Brutus…${prompt}
  8209: Hé, hé ! Tu vas pas ramollir maintenant, hein ?${prompt}
  8210: J-Je… je sais pas quoi dire. Je crois que j’ai un truc dans l’œil…${prompt}
  8211: Si tout ce que tu comptes faire, c’est rester là à pleurnicher, alors dégage de mes écuries ! Tu fais fuir les clients !${prompt}
  8212: M-Merci, Brutus…${prompt}
  8213: Non, merci à vous tous. J’oublierai jamais ce jour… jamais…${prompt}
  8214: Vous avez appris la compétence d’arme « Décimation » !${prompt}
  8215: |-
    Tu vois, Dietmund est revenu, comme je te l’avais dit. Je pouvais le lire dans ses yeux.
    Les gens ne sont pas si différents des chocobos, tu sais. On peut toujours deviner ce qu’ils pensent en regardant bien leurs yeux, qu’ils soient bleus, noirs ou de n’importe quelle couleur.${prompt}
  8216: |-
    Cette petite va bientôt retourner chez son maître…
    Mais tu me verras pas pleurer ! M. Dietmund m’a promis que je pourrais la monter quand je veux !${prompt}
  8217: Le chocobo a l’air extrêmement heureux.${prompt}
  8218: Comment va-t-il ?${prompt}
  8219: Eh bien, il ne semble pas avoir de blessures visibles. À vrai dire, je ne sais pas exactement ce qui cloche chez lui.${prompt}
  8220: |-
    Tu ne sais pas exactement ?
    Donc tu as une sorte d’hypothèse ?${prompt}

  8224: Wolfgang, que s’est-il vraiment passé dans cette pièce ? Qu’était cet appareil, et que cherchaient à faire les scientifiques de Jeuno avec lui ? Tu sais quelque chose, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8225: Vous n’avez pas à vous mêler des affaires du Duché.${prompt}
  8226: |-
    Je vois… Je suppose que certaines choses valent mieux rester dans l’ombre.
    Je me demande souvent s’il faut informer un patient quand sa maladie est incurable. Mais s’il reste ne serait-ce qu’un mince espoir de guérison…${prompt}
  8227: Si vous insinuez que Jeuno est malade, vous faites fausse route.${prompt}
  8228: |-
    <Soupir>
    Laissez-moi reformuler ma question.${prompt}
  8229: D’ami à ami, que s’est-il simplement passé ce jour-là ?${prompt}
  8230: Je… je ne sais vraiment pas. C’est pourquoi il est crucial que nous interrogions ce garçon.${prompt}
  8231: S’il n’a rien de grave, alors rien ne nous empêche de le transférer immédiatement au Palais du Grand-Duc. Monberaux, préparez son transfert.${prompt}
  8232: |-
    Ah, c’est vous…
    Autant j’aimerais m’asseoir et parler de vos aventures autour d’une bonne tasse de thé de San d’Oria, ce n’est pas vraiment le moment.${prompt}
  8233: |-
    Attendez.
    Peut-être savez-vous quelque chose sur ce qui s’est passé près de la mer de Shu’Meyo. Ces derniers temps, j’ai entendu des rumeurs étranges…${prompt}
  8234: Docteur Monberaux, il y a du remue-ménage dehors, à l’infirmerie. Pensez-vous que les gardes ducaux soient de retour ?${prompt}
  8235: Ces maudits égoïstes ! Ne pensent-ils qu’à leurs propres intérêts ?${prompt}
  8236: Je m’excuse, mais je dois d’abord m’occuper de quelque chose.${prompt}
  8237: Et nous n’obtiendrons aucune réponse tant que ce garçon ne sera pas réveillé et en garde à vue ! Remettez-le-nous ! C’est un ordre !${prompt}
  8238: Vous pouvez m’ordonner ce que vous voulez, mais je ne vous laisserai pas réveiller ce garçon !${prompt}
  8239: Messieurs, vous avez vos ordres.${prompt}
  8240: |-
    Attendez, Wolfgang !
    Qu’allez-vous lui faire ? Je ne vous laisserai pas maltraiter mes patients comme ça !${prompt}
  8241: |-
    Que se passe-t-il !?
    … !?${prompt}
  8242: 'Il… Il a juste disparu !${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  8243: 'Ne restez pas plantés là ! Scellez la zone ! Je ne veux voir ni homme, ni femme, ni chien, ni chat quitter le Jeuno Supérieur. Ce garçon ne peut pas se cacher longtemps.${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  8244: J’ai déjà vu cet enfant quelque part…${prompt}
  8245: |-
    Je comprends pas. Aucun signe de conscience pendant des heures, puis il se réveille soudainement et s’enfuit…
    Il doit y avoir une explication…${prompt}
  8246: Je suis désolé que vous ayez dû assister à cet échange. J’aimerais mieux vous expliquer ce qui vient de se passer, mais je suis moi-même perplexe face aux événements d’aujourd’hui.${prompt}
  8247: |-
    Tout va bien ?
    Vous avez l’air un peu pâle.${prompt}
  8248: Eh bien, j’espère que ce n’est rien de grave.${prompt}
  8249: |-
    Ce médaillon que vous tenez. Il appartient au garçon, n’est-ce pas ?
    Qu’est-ce que c’est ? Vous dites qu’il vous l’a donné ?${prompt}
  8250: Je vous suggère de le garder. Ça pourrait nous donner des indices sur ce qui se passe vraiment. Ça pourrait aussi…${prompt}
  8251: '… Laissez tomber.${prompt}'
  8252: |-
    Peut-être devrais-je commencer mes rondes dans les Jardins de Ru’Lude. Je pourrais glaner des informations précieuses.
    J’ai le sentiment que la situation là-haut est encore plus tendue qu’ici…${prompt}
  8253: |-
    D’un point de vue médical, c’est un miracle que ce garçon se soit réveillé.
    Je ne peux pas l’expliquer…${prompt}
  8254: Pourquoi Wolfgang tient-il tant à lui parler ?${prompt}
  8255: Peut-être devriez-vous visiter les Jardins de Ru’Lude. J’ai le sentiment que la situation là-haut est encore plus tendue qu’ici.${prompt}
  8256: Une connaissance du patient qui vient d’être admis ?${prompt}
  8257: C’est exact. Où est-elle ?${prompt}
  8258: Ah, vous connaissez aussi le patient ? Vous pouvez accompagner ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8259: Cependant, je dois vous avertir. Son état est encore très instable. Elle semble souffrir terriblement…${prompt}
  8260: Prishe !${prompt}
  8261: Attendez, vous êtes…${prompt}
  8262: Vous vous connaissez ? Ce noble guerrier est celui qui a amené notre princesse inconsciente.${prompt}
  8263: Méssire Tenzen… l’aventurier, ${name-player}, semble également connaître le patient.${prompt}
  8264: |-
    Prishe…
    Quel sombre destin s’est abattu sur toi… ?${prompt}
  8265: '… Gardienne…${prompt}'
  8266: Prishe ?${prompt}
  8267: '… de l’… Apocalypse…${prompt}'
  8268: Gardienne de l’Apocalypse ? De quoi parlez-vous ?${prompt}
  8269: '!?${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  8270: |-
    M’appeler…
    … Arrêtez !
    … Éloignez-vous !${prompt}
  8271: N-non… !${prompt}
  8272: Son amulette ! Elle a disparu !${prompt}
  8273: Vous ! N’avez-vous pas vu une amulette au cou de ma chère amie ? Sans elle, elle…${prompt}
  8274: Je suis désolé, mademoiselle, mais quand je l’ai trouvée, elle n’avait pas cette amulette dont vous parlez.${prompt}
  8275: Impossible…${prompt}
  8276: Attendez ! ${name-player}, pourriez-vous me montrer votre amulette ?${prompt}
  8277: |-
    J’ai l’impression qu’elles pourraient être liées d’une manière ou d’une autre.
    Je vous en prie ! C’est peut-être notre seul espoir de sauver Prishe !${prompt}
  8278: |-
    L’état de la patiente s’est stabilisé. Cependant, elle ne montre aucun signe de réveil de ce profond sommeil où elle est plongée.
    En toutes mes années de médecine, je n’ai jamais vu pareille chose…${prompt}
  8279: ${name-player}, pensez-vous vraiment que tout ceci est lié à cette amulette ?${prompt}
  8280: Si seulement ce mystérieux garçon qui l’a laissée tomber était encore là, il pourrait peut-être nous aider à comprendre la situation…${prompt}
  8281: Un garçon… ? Vous ne parlez pas de celui que recherche la Garde Ducale, si ?${prompt}
  8282: Qu’est-ce que c’est ? Vous aussi, vous avez entendu les rumeurs sur ce jeune homme étrange qui a disparu il y a quelques jours ?${prompt}
  8283: Lors d’une visite au palais, on m’a parlé d’un garçon soi-disant dangereux.${prompt}
  8284: |-
    Je vois…
    Donc, ce garçon portait une amulette semblable à celle de la fille. Ça pourrait expliquer pourquoi elle a été attaquée…${prompt}
  8285: Mais l’amulette de Prishe lui a été donnée par le Cardinal Mildaurion. Il est absurde de penser que le cardinal pourrait être lié à des criminels !${prompt}
  8286: Le Cardinal Mildaurion de la cathédrale de Tavnazia ?${prompt}
  8287: Oui. Il y a longtemps, le cardinal a offert cette amulette à Prishe après qu’elle a été grièvement blessée dans un accident. Elle a dit que c’était pour la protéger.${prompt}
  8288: |-
    Depuis ce jour, elle ne s’en est jamais séparée.
    Mais pourquoi quelqu’un voudrait-il la voler… ?${prompt}
  8289: Peut-être que c’est ce garçon qui a volé l’amulette de la patiente. Cela dit, il y a quelques jours, j’ai entendu qu’on l’avait aperçu récemment dans les ruines de Pso’Xja, au fin fond des redoutables Terres du Nord.${prompt}
  8290: Quoi !? Vous en êtes sûr !?${prompt} 
  8291: Un soldat que j’ai soigné pour hypothermie m’a dit que son groupe l’avait vu seul dans les ruines. Quand la Garde Ducale l’a appris, elle est partie sur-le-champ pour les Terres du Nord.${prompt}
  8292: |-
    Donc, le quatrième cristal se trouve dans les ruines de Pso’Xja…
    Je n’ai pas de temps à perdre.${prompt}
  8293: Attendez !${prompt}
  8294: Avant de partir pour votre voyage, sachez que les ruines sont sous le contrôle d’une organisation appelée le Tenshodo. Vous devriez d’abord vous adresser à eux.${prompt}
  8295: |-
    Je vois…
    Merci pour cette information.
    Bonne journée, Docteur !${prompt}
  8296: Je me demande s’il pourrait y avoir un lien entre ce garçon et cette jeune femme, Prishe.${prompt}
  8297: D’après les rumeurs au sein de la Garde Ducale, quelqu’un l’a vu dans la tour centrale des ruines nord de Pso’Xja. Mais pour pénétrer les parties les plus profondes de ces tours, il faut obtenir la permission du Tenshodo…${prompt}
  8298: Vous dites que vous connaissez l’Elvaan qui s’est effondrée ici ?${prompt}
  8299: |-
    Un voyageur vêtu de manière étrange, venu de l’Est, l’a amenée à la clinique du Docteur Monberaux.
    Oh, j’espère qu’elle va bien.${prompt}
  8300: Contrairement aux rumeurs sordides qui circulent dans les rues du Duché, l’Elvaan qui s’est effondrée ici n’a pas été attaquée par un sombre assaillant.${prompt}
  8301: Alors qu’elle s’agenouillait devant la statue de la Déesse pour prier, elle s’est soudain écroulée au sol et a commencé à convulser violemment. J’ai essayé de purifier son âme des terribles démons qui la possédaient, mais mon eau bénite n’a eu aucun effet.${prompt}
  8302: Je ne peux qu’espérer que mes prières pour sa sécurité atteignent vite la Déesse.${prompt}
  8303: |-
    …
    Je… Je m’excuse. Je ne suis plus moi-même depuis que l’Elvaan a eu son… accident.${prompt}
  8304: Je sais que Mère Chiphraix insiste sur le fait qu’il n’y avait aucune mauvaise intention, mais je jurerais avoir senti une présence obscure derrière la fille avant qu’elle ne s’effondre.${prompt}
  8305: Et maintenant, chaque fois que j’y pense, je me sens étourdi et pris de vertiges…${prompt}
  8306: Si vous êtes ici pour voir la fille, elle est réveillée depuis quelques heures.${prompt}
  8307: De quoi pensez-vous parler !? Il n’y a aucune chance que la cardinale ait pu…${prompt}
  8308: Je sais, mais même si c’était le cas, je suis sûr qu’il y a une explication raisonnable.${prompt}
  8309: Oh, ${name-player}. Je ne saurais exprimer ma gratitude pour avoir sauvé Prishe.${prompt}
  8310: Elle m’a raconté ce qui s’est passé ce jour-là.${prompt}
  8311: Possédée par une bête inconnue dans son propre rêve…${prompt}
  8312: Vous et Tenzen avez réussi à la ramener. Mais nous ignorons toujours ce qu’est devenue l’amulette qu’elle portait.${prompt}
  8313: J’ai l’impression que ce qui s’est passé ces derniers jours n’est que la partie émergée de l’iceberg.${prompt}
  8314: ${name-player}, pouvez-vous nous en dire plus ?${prompt}
  8315: C’est à vous qu’on devrait poser la question !${prompt}
  8316: Quels sont vos liens avec ce criminel que moi, le Duché et ${name-player} recherchons ?${prompt}
  8317: Ce garçon qui échappe sans cesse à la Garde Ducale – où se cache-t-il ?${prompt}
  8318: Prishe, vous devez me répondre. Pourquoi ce garçon était-il avec vous, et où a-t-il disparu ?${prompt}
  8319: |-
    Aucune idée…
    Mais une chose est sûre : je me fiche qu’il soit en tête de la liste des recherchés de Jeuno. Sans lui pour me tirer d’affaire, je serais déjà en train de pousser des pâquerettes dans la nécropole.${prompt}
  8320: De toute façon, c’est pas le garçon qui m’inquiète. Qu’est-ce que vous comptez faire pour ce monstre dans mon rêve ? Vous avez dit que vous saviez ce que c’était, non ?${prompt}
  8321: Allez ! Crachez le morceau, vieux fou ! Pourquoi cette chose s’en prend à moi ?${prompt}
  8322: Diabolos… Avatar terrestre des rêves…${prompt}
  8323: Avatar terrestre… ?${prompt}
  8324: Les avatars terrestres sont les cinq dieux puissants nés de Vana’diel, chargés de le protéger.${prompt}
  8325: Il y a des éons, les cinq avatars ont livré une bataille acharnée contre une présence maléfique qui cherchait à envelopper et étouffer notre monde.${prompt}
  8326: Il y a l’oiseau de feu de la résurrection, Phœnix, dont la lame que je porte a été bénie.${prompt}
  8327: Et puis il y a le maître des rêves, Diabolos ; le gardien de la lune, Fenrir ; le porteur d’arcs-en-ciel, Carbuncle ; et le conquérant des cieux, Bahamut…${prompt}
  8328: Ba-Bahamut !?${prompt}
  8329: |-
    Vous avez entendu parler de la légende de Bahamut ?
    Figurez-vous que j’ai traversé des malms d’océan pour venir sur ce continent afin de rencontrer Bahamut… et lui demander son aide pour arrêter le Gardien de l’Apocalypse.${prompt}
  8330: '!!!${prompt}'
  8331: Maintenant que vous en parlez, quand je suis allé au Cap Riverne, je me souviens que Bahamut a mentionné quelque chose à propos d’un gardien…${prompt}
  8332: Gardien de l’Apocalypse… Prishe ! Ce sont les mots que tu as prononcés pendant que tu étais inconsciente !${prompt}
  8333: |-
    Tout ce dont je me souviens, c'est qu'avant que vous arriviez, ce monstre Diabolos parlait d'une chanson qui parlait du gardien.
    Comment ça s'appelait déjà...? « Memoria de la S^tona » ?${prompt}
  8334: La mémoire du cristal…${prompt}
  8335: Il a aussi dit que lorsque le gardien arrivera, « notre pacte sera accompli ». Quoi que cela puisse signifier…${prompt}
  8336: Et c’est pour ça qu’il m’a dit d’aller voir Bahamut dès que possible…${prompt}
  8337: |-
    « Notre pacte »…
    Que pouvait-il bien vouloir dire… ?${prompt}
  8338: Aucune idée, et j’ai pas l’intention de retourner là-bas pour lui poser la question.${prompt}
  8339: Mais j’ai le sentiment que Bahamut pourrait nous donner des détails. C’est pourquoi nous devons retourner à Tavnazia !${prompt}
  8340: Retourner à Tavnazia ? Vous voulez dire que vous venez du Marquisat ?${prompt}
  8341: Exactement. Mais nous avons été téléportés ici par Bahamut quand nous avons essayé de lui parler…${prompt}
  8342: Quelle tournure d’événements incroyable !${prompt}
  8343: Il se trouve que j’ai demandé un transport pour Tavnazia au chef des Tenshodo, Aldo. Si c’est possible, j’aimerais que vous deux m’accompagniez pour m’aider à trouver Bahamut !${prompt}
  8344: Alors c’est toi dont Aldo parlait…${prompt}
  8345: Eh bien, plus on est de fous, plus on rit, non ? On se retrouve au Tenshodo quand vous serez prêts à partir.${prompt}
  8346: Compris !${prompt}
  8347: Oh, et toi, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8348: Je vais garder cette amulette encore un petit moment. Ça te dérange ?${prompt}
  8349: Hé, et quand tu auras fini tes affaires ici, pourquoi ne pas revenir à Tavnazia ? Tu connais le chemin, non ?${prompt}
  8350: À bientôt !${prompt}
  8351: 'Vous prêtez le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} à Prishe.${prompt}'
  8352: |-
    Je suis ravi de voir ma jeune patiente complètement rétablie.
    Elle est sacrément énergique quand elle est réveillée, pas vrai ?${prompt}
  8353: |-
    Il semble que nos visiteurs soient retournés à Tavnazia.
    J’avoue que j’ai été très surpris d’apprendre que cette nation existait encore.${prompt}
  8354: ${name-player}, on dirait que vous avez traversé une sacrée épreuve dans les Terres du Nord.${prompt}
  8355: J’ai essayé de glaner des informations auprès de la Garde Ducale ; mais aucun d’eux ne veut – ou plutôt, n’est autorisé – à parler de l’affaire, bien que la peur dans leurs yeux en dise long.${prompt} 
  8356: |-
    Et ce n’est pas tout…
    Récemment, des rumeurs inquiétantes circulent, disant que la fin du monde est proche.${prompt}
  8357: Ces rumeurs prétendent aussi que la jeune patiente que j’ai soignée – la fille à qui on a volé l’amulette – est liée à tout ça d’une manière ou d’une autre.${prompt}
  8358: J’ai même entendu dire que la Garde Ducale avait un mandat d’arrêt contre elle…${prompt}
  8359: Absurde ! Dame Prishe est simplement manipulée. Le vrai criminel, c’est ce garçon !${prompt}
  8360: Tiens, n’est-ce pas…${prompt}
  8361: Je m’excuse pour mon entrée soudaine, Docteur.${prompt}
  8362: |-
    ${name-player} !
    Quelque chose de terrible est en train de se passer !${prompt}
  8363: Je viens du Palais du Grand-Duc, où j’ai entendu parler du plan insensé du Duché. Jeuno a commencé à mobiliser la Garde Ducale pour préparer une attaque contre… Bahamut !${prompt}
  8364: Oui, Bahamut a menacé Vana’diel avec la promesse d’une apocalypse. Pourtant, il reste l’un des avatars terrestres chargés de protéger notre monde.${prompt}
  8365: Il doit y avoir un moyen de convaincre le conquérant des cieux… C’est pourquoi j’ai demandé à accompagner le commandant de cette opération, Dame Esha’ntarl. Malheureusement…${prompt}
  8366: '… le commandant n’était pas du genre à entendre raison. Elle est persuadée qu’essayer de communiquer avec Bahamut serait inutile, et que le seul moyen de sauver les habitants de Vana’diel est d’attaquer le Roi Dragon et ses sbires avant qu’ils ne frappent nos cités.${prompt}'
  8367: Excusez-moi, monsieur. Je ne suis pas sûr de bien comprendre ce que vous essayez de dire.${prompt}
  8368: Bahamut se prépare à lancer une attaque sur les quatre nations ? Ça ne peut pas être vrai !${prompt}
  8369: Mais si c’était le cas…${prompt}
  8370: Les dirigeants des nations ont-ils été informés ? Leurs armées ont-elles commencé à se préparer ?${prompt}
  8371: Malheureusement, il est probable que San d’Oria, Bastok et Windurst restent dans l’ignorance de la situation. Et même s’ils étaient prévenus, ils n’auraient aucun moyen de riposter.${prompt}
  8372: 'Bahamut est appelé le conquérant des cieux pour une raison. Le pouvoir qu’il détient, lui et ses sbires, dépasse tout ce qu’on peut imaginer : le pouvoir de contrôler le temps et l’espace.${prompt}'
  8373: Contrôler le temps et l’espace… ?${prompt}
  8374: Dès l’instant où lui et ses sbires apparaîtraient au-dessus de nos cités, ce serait notre défaite. Nous n’aurions d’autre choix que d’accepter l’anéantissement…${prompt}
  8375: '…${prompt}'
  8376: Mais je pense qu’il y a encore une solution…${prompt}
  8377: Dame Esha’ntarl a mentionné que Bahamut accumule actuellement l’énergie nécessaire pour téléporter ses congénères vers les lieux d’attaque.${prompt}
  8378: Si nous pouvions atteindre Bahamut avant qu’il n’ait assez d’énergie, nous pourrions peut-être le convaincre de ne pas lancer son assaut contre Vana’diel.${prompt}
  8379: Le convaincre ? La fin du monde est imminente, et vous voulez vous asseoir pour discuter avec celui qui la déclenche !?${prompt}
  8380: |-
    Exactement !
    Avec la Lame du Phénix et ${name-player} à mes côtés, je suis convaincu que je peux persuader Bahamut d’épargner la vie des habitants de ce monde.${prompt}
  8381: Mais pour réussir, j’ai besoin de votre aide, Docteur.${prompt}
  8382: Je dois savoir où ce garçon a été découvert pour la première fois !${prompt}
  8383: '… !${prompt}'
  8384: |-
    …
    Entendu.
    Wolfgang, capitaine de la Garde Ducale, m’a ordonné de ne révéler cette information à personne… mais je crains de ne plus avoir le choix.${prompt}
  8385: Au premier étage de la Tour de Delkfutt, il y a une grande porte qui mène aux zones plus profondes de la tour.${prompt}
  8386: C’est quelque part là-dessous que le garçon est mystérieusement apparu. Une grande salle centrale… mais c’est tout ce dont je me souviens.${prompt}
  8387: |-
    Je vous suis extrêmement reconnaissant pour tout ce que vous avez fait pour nous, Docteur.
    Venez, ${name-player}, nous n’avons pas de temps à perdre.${prompt}
  8388: Ah, mais il y a une porte – une porte verrouillée, et seul Wolfgang sait comment l’ouvrir.${prompt}
  8389: Je n’ai aucune inquiétude, car le Phénix nous guidera sur le chemin.${prompt}
  8390: ${name-player}, préparez-vous vite et retrouvez-moi à la tour.${prompt}
  8391: ${name-player}, ça pourrait être une tentative vaine, mais laissez-moi demander à Wolfgang la clé de cette salle.${prompt}
  8392: Bien que parfois mal orienté, c’est un homme qui croit fermement en la justice. Il pourrait penser que c’est à lui seul de protéger le monde à la veille de sa destruction.${prompt}
  8393: |-
    Nous devons lui faire comprendre qu’il y a parmi nous d’autres qui suivent la même voie que lui.
    Tenez. Prenez cette enveloppe au poste de garde du palais. Je prierai pour votre succès, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8394: |-
    Le garçon est d’abord apparu dans la Tour de Delkfutt.
    Au premier étage de la tour, il y a une grande porte qui mène aux zones plus profondes de la structure…${prompt}
  8395: |-
    Wolfgang saura comment ouvrir la porte au-delà.
    Prenez cette enveloppe au poste de garde du palais. Je prierai pour votre succès, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8396: Je vois à sa réaction que Wolfgang a compris le sens de la carte.${prompt}
  8397: |-
    Où devez-vous aller ? Ha ha. C’est un secret, ${name-player}.
    Mais si vous y réfléchissez bien, je pense que vous devinerez.${prompt}
  8398: |-
    Je savais que Wolfgang viendrait. C'est un bon homme, malgré son côté un peu entêté.
    Maintenant, hâtez-vous vers la Tour de Delkfutt. Tenzen devrait déjà être en route.${prompt}
  8399: Quelque part au premier étage, il y a une grande porte qui mène au sous-sol de la tour. La clé que vous avez reçue de Wolfgang ouvrira cette porte.${prompt}
  8400: Wolfgang ne devrait plus vous poser de problèmes. Je pense qu'il commence enfin à réaliser ce qui est véritablement important dans ce monde.${prompt}
  8401: |-
    Avez-vous entendu les rumeurs ?
    Certains disent que la fin du monde est proche.${prompt}
  8402: Grâce à cela, nous, ici à la clinique, avons récemment passé plus de temps à soigner l'esprit des gens que leurs fractures.${prompt}
  8403: ${name-player}, c'est bon de vous voir.${prompt}
  8404: Nous avons enfin compris toute la trame que nos récits séparés ont tissée.${prompt}
  8405: Je n'aurais jamais cru que quelque chose comme ça était possible.${prompt}
  8406: Je vous suggère de vous préparer avant l'arrivée de Dame Ulmia.${prompt}
  8407: Pourquoi tout le monde est-il si silencieux ? Quelque chose ne va pas ?${prompt}
  8408: |-
    Dame Ulmia, nous vous attendions.
    Aurez-vous le courage d'écouter l'histoire que nous avons à raconter ?${prompt}
  8409: Bien sûr, nous avons essayé de réfuter cette conclusion et de trouver une autre explication.${prompt}
  8410: Cependant, nous savons maintenant que le garçon, Selh'teus, est venu pour contrecarrer les plans des anciens et voler la lumière des cristaux.${prompt}
  8411: Nous savons aussi que la Divinité des Ténèbres qui gouverne les Kindred n'était pas Promathia après tout.${prompt}
  8412: Mais... les Moblins... ont entendu... de la Divinité des Ténèbres... que le... Gardien de l'Apocalypse... est déjà... né.${prompt}
  8413: Et vous avez sûrement vu la magicitite incrustée dans la poitrine de Prishe ?${prompt}
  8414: Selon votre explication, cette pierre contenait le Vide du Dieu du Crépuscule, Promathia.${prompt}
  8415: |-
    Dame Ulmia.
    Cela doit être un choc pour quelqu'un d'aussi proche de Dame Prishe.${prompt}
  8416: Mais je dois vous informer des faits que j'ai appris des avatars terrestres Carbuncle et Fenrir.${prompt}
  8417: Après dix mille ans, le Gardien de l'Apocalypse était destiné à naître dans la nation de Tavnazia !${prompt}
  8418: Vous ne dites quand même pas que ce gardien dont vous parlez est Prishe !${prompt}
  8419: |-
    C'est impossible !
    Je refuse de le croire !${prompt}
  8420: Nous avons été amis depuis avant la destruction de Tavnazia !${prompt}
  8421: Je peux honnêtement dire que je n'ai jamais rencontré une personne aussi pure de cœur.${prompt}
  8422: Elle a plus de foi, et plus de courage...${prompt}
  8423: Comment pourrait-elle être le Gardien de l'Apocalypse et encore encourager Diabolos à sauver le monde ?${prompt}
  8424: Il est vrai que je ne connais personne qui possède autant d'ardeur pour la vie que Prishe.${prompt}
  8425: Et si nous avions le temps et les connaissances, nous sauverions Dame Prishe de ce destin.${prompt}
  8426: Cependant, nous n'avons plus de temps.${prompt}
  8427: |-
    Un devoir nous incombe :
    Le Seigneur Bahamut et ses sbires doivent être arrêtés !${prompt}
  8428: Et si le Cardinal Mildaurion est encore en vie comme nous le croyons, elle prévoit d'utiliser Prishe pour réveiller le Dieu du Crépuscule.${prompt}
  8429: Avec Prishe et sa magicitite en possession du cardinal, le monde n'est plus qu'à un pas de l'oubli !${prompt}
  8430: Quand Promathia... se réveillera... il n'y aura... plus moyen... d'arrêter... les Moblins.${prompt}

    Arrêtez, tous.
    Vous avez vraiment l'intention de vous débarrasser de Prishe si cela signifie prévenir les plans du Roi Wyrm Bahamut ?${prompt}

  8433: Dame Ulmia !${prompt}
  8434: '...${prompt}'
  8435: |-
    Laissez-la tranquille.
    La première chose que nous devons faire est de rrressecourir Prishe du Palais du Grand Duc.
    Je vais commencer à travailler sur un plan.${prompt}
  8436: |-
    Je vais faire appel à de vieilles connaissances.
    Elles pourraient être en mesure de nous aider.${prompt}

    Quelle décision ?${prompt}
  8441: Ne laisse pas nos actions te préoccuper.${prompt}
  8442: Tu es libre de suivre ton propre chemin à partir de maintenant.${prompt}
  8443: |-
    Je ne te demande que de veiller sur Dame Ulmia.
    Elle n'a pas bien pris cette nouvelle.${prompt}
  8444: Il y a peu de choses que tu peux dire pour la réconforter, mais au moins, assure-toi qu'elle arrive saine et sauve à Tavnazia.${prompt}
  8445: Si tu demandes l'aide de Dame Esha'ntarl, je suis sûr que ton retour sera rapide.${prompt}
  8446: À bientôt !${prompt}
  8447: |-
    Comprends-tu ce à quoi nous avons tous consenti ici ?
    Nous sommes arrivés à une conclusion brutale et sanglante.${prompt}
  8448: Bien que aucune vie ne soit plus importante qu'une autre, j'ai le devoir de sauver le monde, quel qu'en soit le coût.${prompt}
  8449: |-
    Mais malgré tout...
    Je m'inquiète pour Dame Ulmia.${prompt}
  8450: Afin de sauver le monde de la destruction, nous devons vaincre celui connu comme le Gardien de l'Apocalypse.${prompt}
  8451: Même si Dame Prishe elle-même est le Gardien, je n'échouerai pas à accomplir cette tâche.${prompt}
  8452: |-
    Une belle dame vient de courir par là, des larmes coulant sur son visage.
    Je n'ai jamais rien vu de tel.${prompt}
  8453: |-
    Aujourd'hui, c'est le jour des Tarutarus au pub, et elle était une Elvaan.

  8454: Je suis content de voir que vous avez tous survécu indemnes.${prompt}
  8455: Vous... !${prompt}
  8456: Vous êtes... le prêtre... !?${prompt}
  8457: Content de vous revoir tous les deux après si longtemps.${prompt}
  8458: |-
    Cela fait vingt ans que je ne t'ai pas vu, Shikaree Z.
    Et cent ans pour toi, Jabbos, si je ne m'abuse.${prompt}
  8459: Et toi, l'homme de chance extraordinaire.${prompt}
  8460: Je suis ravi d'être de nouveau en votre présence, Cardinal Mildaurion.${prompt}
  8461: J'aimerais célébrer ces retrouvailles tant attendues ; cependant, ce n'est pas le moment.${prompt}
  8462: Lord Bahamut nous a révélé une vérité troublante - le Gardien de l'Apocalypse attend dans la capitale céleste d'Al'Taieu.${prompt}
  8463: Jusqu'à présent, la Société Armathrwn croyait que la ville d'Al'Taieu était détruite.${prompt}
  8464: Compte tenu du conseil des avatars terrestres et des mémoires de Selh'teus, cependant, nous pouvons supposer que la capitale céleste existe toujours.${prompt}
  8465: |-
    La société se concentre maintenant sur l'obtention de plus d'informations.
    À cette fin, l'objectif de notre prochaine opération est de capturer - et non de tuer - Lord Bahamut.${prompt}
  8466: Moi, Esha'ntarl, je rejoindrai la flotte principale de navires de guerre et me dirigerai une fois de plus vers les confins de la terre.${prompt}
  8467: Mais il y a une autre question importante qui nécessite notre attention immédiate - une affaire concernant le cinquième cristal mère.${prompt}
  8468: Quelqu'un a apparemment séparé le cinquième cristal de la Ligne Cristalline.${prompt}
  8469: Quand le garçon, Selh'teus, est apparu, n'était-ce pas cette Ligne Cristalline le conduit par lequel il est passé avec Lord Bahamut ?${prompt}
  8470: |-
    Juste une minute, nom de nom !
    Donc, maintenant, on ne peut plus utiliser ce gadget de pipeline pour atteindre le cinquième cristal mère !?${prompt}
  8471: Comment sommes-nous supposés aller à Al'Taieu et en finir avec le Gardien de l'Apocalypse !?${prompt}
  8472: |-
    Comment, en effet.
    Quoi qu'il en soit, nous devons chercher un autre chemin maintenant que Phoenix n'est plus avec nous.${prompt}
  8473: |-
    Attendez.
    Mildaurion, vous avez mentionné que « quelqu'un » a isolé le cinquième cristal mère ?${prompt}
  8474: Qui est rrresponsable de cet acte de sabotage ?${prompt}
  8475: |-
    Je ne sais pas.
    Les seules personnes capables d'un tel exploit seraient soit Selh'teus, soit Nag'molada...${prompt}
  8476: J'ai actuellement des troupes de Jeuno en préparation pour envahir Movalpolos.${prompt}
  8477: M... Movalpolos... !?${prompt}
  8478: |-
    Les Moblins... sont en danger... !?
    Je dois... partir... immédiatement !${prompt}
  8479: Jabbos a passé un siècle à vivre avec les Moblins dans l'effort d'éviter ce genre de développement.${prompt}
  8480: C'est très préoccupant. Je vais le suivre et m'assurer qu'il ne soit pas blessé.${prompt}
  8481: Je vais vous accompagner !${prompt}
  8482: Je me rends compte que Jabbos a essayé pendant des années de convaincre les Moblins qu'ils n'étaient pas les enfants de Promathia.${prompt}
  8483: Mais pour le bien du cristal mère, les Moblins ne peuvent pas être laissés à eux-mêmes.${prompt}
  8484: S'il échoue à les persuader du contraire, ils pourraient tenter de détruire le cinquième cristal.${prompt}
  8485: Détruire le cristal !?${prompt}
  8486: Le cristal mère est au début et à la fin du voyage d'une personne dans cette vie.${prompt}
  8487: Après avoir appris ce fait de Jabbos, les Moblins croient maintenant que détruire le cristal mère signifiera la fin pour les enfants d'Altana.${prompt}
  8488: Comment Jabbos a-t-il pu ne pas mentionner quelque chose d'aussi important !?${prompt}
  8489: |-
    Il n'avait pas le choix.
    Si ce genre de chose devenait de notoriété publique, Movalpolos serait dévasté et tous les Moblins massacrés.${prompt}
  8490: '!${prompt}'
  8491: |-
    Mademoiselle Mildaurion.
    Je ne suis pas en position de donner des conseils à une personne de dix mille ans, mais écoutez-moi.${prompt}
  8492: Tuer chaque dernier Moblin pourrait rendre ce chaos bien propre, mais ce n'est pas ce que j'appellerais une solution.${prompt}
  8493: N'est-ce pas exactement ce que Bahamut essaie de faire ?${prompt}
  8494: '...${prompt}'
  8495: |-
    Vous avez raison...
    Rien de bon ne peut sortir de cela...${prompt}
  8496: Je vais supplier la Société Armathrwn de trouver une solution pacifique à ce problème.${prompt}
  8497: Merci, Mademoiselle Mildaurion !${prompt}
  8498: Mais à partir de maintenant, je vais rejoindre la société pour surveiller ses actions.${prompt}
  8499: |-
    Mes mouvements seront limités, mais soyez rassurés, je veillerai toujours sur vous.
    Maintenant, allez, mes braves compagnons. Le sort du monde et de ses habitants est entre vos mains.${prompt}

    D'accord !
    Ulmia, Tenzen, ${name-player} !
    Direction Movalpolos !${prompt}
  8501: Tous ceux qui veulent se battre pour la victoire ultime, suivez-moi !!!${prompt}
  8502: J'ai entendu dire que ce pub est parfois réservé par le chef du Tenshodo.${prompt}
  8503: |-
    Il n'y a qu'un momentaru, il y avait des Mithra, des Galka et toutes sortes de personnes sortant par la porte.
    Ils disaient quelque chose à propos d'aller à Movalpolos.${prompt}
  8504: |-
    Pensent-ils ramener leurs amis bêtes ici ?
    La prochaine chose que vous savez, ils auront un "Jour des Gobelins".${prompt}
  8505: Vous devez vraiment être sérieux concernant vos croyances pour choisir le Temple de la Déesse plutôt que les bruits et les visions animées de Jeuno.${prompt}
  8506: Au fil de mes longues années, j'ai découvert qu'une personne sérieuse dans ${choice-player-gender}[ses/ses] croyances est une personne à qui on peut confier une tâche sérieuse.${prompt}
  8507: Êtes-vous disposé à entendre ma requête ?${prompt}
  8508: |-
    Écouter sa requête ?
    ${selection-lines}
    J'écouterai.
    Je viens ici pour la paix et le calme.${prompt}
  8509: "Merci, aventurier. \nPeut-être avez-vous entendu parler des ruines de Pso'Xja, que l'on trouve sur le Glacier de Beaucedine ?${prompt}"
  8510: On murmure que ces ruines sont profondément liées à l'histoire des anciens.${prompt}
  8511: Lorsque des voleurs ont découvert ces structures mystérieuses dans les années suivantes, ils ont été rapides à installer des grilles en fer aux entrées des tours et à emporter les reliques à l'intérieur.${prompt}
  8512: Cependant, ils n'ont jamais réussi à ouvrir la porte décorée qui se trouve dans la partie la plus profonde des ruines. Les voleurs ont cherché un moyen d'ouvrir ce portail pendant de nombreuses années.${prompt}
  8513: |-
    Ce n'est que récemment qu'ils ont finalement découvert la clé de cette porte.
    Ce qu'ils ont trouvé à l'intérieur n'a apparemment pas répondu à leurs attentes.${prompt}
  8514: Croyant avoir réclamé tous les trésors à trouver, le Tenshodo a ouvert presque toutes les zones des six tours aux aventuriers.${prompt}
  8515: |-
    Je ne suis pas d'accord avec l'évaluation finale du Tenshodo de leur découverte.
    Le dispositif magique caché derrière cette porte ressemble étroitement à ceux qui existent dans les tours de Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
  8516: Cela ne signifierait-il pas que les tours de Pso'Xja ont une fonction similaire aux ruines de Sarutabaruta ?${prompt}
  8517: J'ai envoyé plusieurs fois des aventuriers partageant votre intégrité explorer les ruines pour enquêter sur cette possibilité.${prompt}
  8518: |-
    Je ne pense pas que le Tenshodo ait donné à cette question la considération qu'elle mérite.
    Un dispositif magique a été trouvé de l'autre côté de cette porte.${prompt}
  8519: Personne ne connaît le but de la construction des tours, et il est bien trop dangereux de permettre à la population générale d'accéder aux ruines sans plus de recherches.${prompt}
  8520: C'est pourquoi j'ai décidé de demander à des aventuriers partageant votre intégrité de sceller cette porte.${prompt}
  8521: |-
    Le seul problème est qu'aucun aventurier n'a pu l'atteindre.
    Il y a deux autres portes qui bloquent le chemin vers la section la plus profonde de la tour sud-ouest.${prompt}
  8522: Allez-vous tenter de trouver un chemin vers le cœur de la tour sud-ouest ?${prompt}
  8523: |-
    Allez-vous y aller ?
    ${selection-lines}
    J'irai.
    Je ne pense pas.${prompt}
  8524: |-
    Vous pourrez ouvrir la porte finale avec ce ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.
    Il devrait également activer le dispositif magique qui se trouve au-delà.${prompt}
  8525: |-
    Une fois le dispositif activé, revenez ici pour votre récompense.

  8526: |-
    Scellez la porte finale en utilisant ce ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.
    Je prie pour votre succès.${prompt}

    Je prie pour votre succès.${prompt}
  8529: |-
    Ça a été trop juste...
    Heureusement, le dispositif a été activé avant l'arrivée de ces savants gênants de Windurst.${prompt}
  8530: |-
    Mais mon travail n'est pas terminé.
    Je dois trouver un moyen de sceller le dispositif pour que personne ne puisse l'arrêter...${prompt}
  8531: |-
    Vous avez ma gratitude.
    Il semble que les obstacles dans la tour ne vous ont pas empêché d'activer le dispositif.${prompt}
  8532: |-
    Les dispositifs dans les autres tours sont également activés, un par un.
    Veuillez accepter votre récompense.${prompt}
  8533: |-
    Vous avez ma gratitude.
    Il semble que les obstacles dans la tour ne vous ont pas empêché de sceller la porte.${prompt}
  8534: |-
    Ne vous inquiétez pas ; les portes dans les autres tours sont en train d'être scellées en ce moment même.
    Veuillez accepter votre récompense.${prompt}
  8535: |-
    Ah, la porte ne s'est pas ouverte pour vous ?
    C'est parce qu'un aventurier plus expérimenté a activé le dispositif avant votre arrivée.${prompt}
  8536: |-
    Cependant, je souhaite toujours reconnaître votre sincère désir d'exécuter ma demande.
    Veuillez accepter ce témoignage de ma reconnaissance.${prompt}
  8537: |-
    Que se passerait-il si tous les dispositifs étaient activés ?
    Je ne pourrais vraiment pas dire.${prompt}

  8599: Les règles de base de Brenner sont les suivantes :${prompt}
  8600: D'abord, les participants se divisent en deux équipes. Chaque camp contient le même nombre de “Flammen-Brenner”.${prompt}
  8601: Au début du match, la moitié des Flammen-Brenner de chaque côté sera allumée avec une "Flamme", tandis que l'autre moitié restera éteinte.${prompt}
  8602: Les participants peuvent saisir une Flamme des Flammen-Brenner de l'équipe adverse et la transporter autour de l'île.${prompt}
  8603: L'objectif est de voler la Flamme de l'adversaire et de l'utiliser pour allumer les Flammen-Brenner de votre côté.${prompt}
  8604: L'équipe qui réussit à allumer tous ses Flammen-Brenner sera déclarée gagnante après un temps spécifié.${prompt}
  8605: Si aucune équipe ne remporte la victoire avant la fin du match, le résultat sera jugé en fonction du score. La section "score du match" du règlement contient plus d'informations à ce sujet.${prompt}
  8606: Brenner est nettement divisé en matchs publics et privés. Les matchs officiels sont organisés périodiquement selon le niveau et permettent une participation générale.${prompt}
  8607: Vous ne pouvez pas réserver l'île lorsqu'un match officiel est en cours.${prompt}
  8608: Aucun objet n'est nécessaire pour participer, mais une petite taxe sera perçue. Vous ne pourrez pas participer si votre niveau est trop bas.${prompt}
  8609: 'Le résultat du match sera enregistré sauf si le nombre de participants ne dépasse pas ${number: 0} membres, ou s''il y a moins de ${number: 1} membres dans un match où le nombre des deux côtés diffère. Dans ces cas, le jeu sera considéré comme un match d''entraînement et ne sera pas enregistré.${prompt}'
  8610: 'Les matchs privés nécessitent une réservation et la participation peut être limitée. Le ${color: 5}Maître de Cérémonie${color: 1} (MC) peut ajuster librement les règles et contrôler le déroulement du match.${prompt}'
  8611: “LS Liga” est une forme de match privé. Vous pouvez en apprendre plus sur LS Liga en parlant à un Maréchal.${prompt}
  8612: Un Flammen-Brenner est un dispositif qui contient une Flamme. Le Flammen-Brenner est couvert par une grille qui s'ouvrira après avoir subi une certaine quantité de dégâts, exposant la Flamme.${prompt}
  8613: Les participants doivent saisir cette chance pour capturer la Flamme avant que la grille ne se referme. Une fois la grille fermée, le Flammen-Brenner commencera à récupérer des dégâts subis.${prompt}
  8614: Si vous parvenez à ouvrir le Flammen-Brenner de l'équipe adverse et à capturer leur Flamme, vous devriez vous dépêcher d'allumer l'un des Flammen-Brenner de votre côté.${prompt}
  8615: Après un certain temps, la Flamme s'éteindra et le Flammen-Brenner de l'équipe adverse sera rallumé.${prompt}
  8616: Notez également que vous ne pouvez pas accélérer votre allure en utilisant des capacités spéciales tant que vous possédez une Flamme.${prompt}
  8617: Dans le cas où aucune des deux équipes ne remplit les conditions de victoire, le résultat du match sera évalué en fonction du score.${prompt}
  8618: Dix points sont attribués à chaque équipe pour chaque Flammen-Brenner allumé, tandis qu'un point est attribué chaque fois qu'une Flamme est capturée, utilisée pour allumer un Flammen-Brenner, ou reprise à un adversaire. Un point est également attribué pour la protection d'un Flammen-Brenner pendant une certaine période de temps.${prompt}
  8619: 'Comme pour Ballista, ${color: 5}prospection${color: 1} (/quarry) peut être utilisé pendant que vous jouez à Brenner. Les participants peuvent utiliser cette capacité pour déterrer des ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} et des objets temporaires.${prompt}'
  8620: 'Cependant, contrairement aux Petras de Ballista, les Petras de Brenner n''ont aucun effet sur le score du match. Vous pouvez ${color: 5}échanger${color: 1} une Petra à un Pursuivant pour récupérer votre HP et MP sans coût pour le TP.${prompt}'
  8621: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} ne peut pas être utilisé en portant une Petra. Notez également que la capacité ${color: 5}éclaireur${color: 1} ne peut pas être utilisée dans Brenner.${prompt}'
  8622: Les Petras seront perdues en cas de KO, mais peuvent être conservées d'un match à l'autre.${prompt}
  8623: 'La capacité ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) peut être utilisée pour augmenter la vitesse du joueur lorsqu''il ne possède pas de Flamme ou de Petras.${prompt}'
  8624: En cas de KO, vous serez ramené au camp de votre équipe. Cependant, la récupération prendra plus de temps plus souvent vous tombez au combat.${prompt}
  8625: En d'autres termes, vous recevrez une pénalité si vous tombez immédiatement après vous être remis d'un KO. De plus, votre TP sera réduit à zéro et vous perdrez toutes les Petras en votre possession.${prompt}
  8626: Pardon. Je n'écoutais pas. Pouvez-vous recommencer du début ?${prompt}
  8627: Je pensais à voix haute quand une fille Elvaan passant par là s'est arrêtée pour me parler.${prompt}
  8628: |-
    Mais qu'en est-il des mog ? Ils ont des ailes, et ils peuvent voler, mais on ne les appellerait pas des oiseaux.
    Ils ont aussi ces drôles d'antennes, mais ce ne sont pas des insectes non plus.${prompt}
  8629: Quand j'ai répondu à sa remarque en disant que les mog et les chocobos sont tous deux des animaux, voici ce qu'elle a demandé :${prompt}
  8630: Alors, quelle est la différence entre les animaux et les gens ?${prompt}
  8631: |-
    J'ai répondu : “Les gens sont plus intelligents que les animaux.”
    Et ensuite, elle a rétorqué : “Les gens sont sûrement plus rusés !”${prompt}
  8632: |-
    Ahahaha, ne te mets pas en colère !
    Je me suis arrêtée pour parler parce que ce que tu disais était important.${prompt}
  8633: |-
    Les gens sont tous différents les uns des autres. Ils sont différents des animaux, et différents des plantes.
    C'est cette différence qui donne de la valeur à tout.${prompt}
  8634: |-
    Il y a beaucoup de façons de penser et de ressentir, et des choses à connaître et à croire.
    Mais à la fin, nous venons tous de la même source.${prompt}
  8635: C'est vrai pour les gens comme pour les animaux.${prompt}
  8636: |-
    Nous avons tous ce qu'on appelle une âme.
    Les âmes des animaux sont pures et simples.${prompt}
  8637: |-
    Regarde là-bas.
    Ce chocobo en est la preuve vivante.${prompt}
  8638: |-
    Tu devrais demander à quelqu'un comment ce chocobo est né.
    Alors tu auras tes réponses.${prompt}
  8639: '...Et puis elle est partie.${prompt}'
  8640: J'ai essayé de découvrir comment ce chocobo était né, mais personne n'a pu me le dire.${prompt}
  8641: Shalott a dit que la mère du chocobo venait des écuries de Bastok.${prompt}
  8642: Elle a dit que c'était un chocobo spécial avec des plumes argentées sur le cou.${prompt}
  8643: Comme j'aimerais aller à Bastok pour la voir moi-même.${prompt}
  8644: Je me demande si cette fille Elvaan repassera dans le coin bientôt...${prompt}
  8645: |-
    Cette fille Elvaan m'a dit que les gens et les animaux avaient tous une âme.
    Elle a dit que les âmes des animaux étaient bien plus pures que celles des gens.${prompt}
  8646: Elle m'a aussi dit que je comprendrais ce qu'elle voulait dire si je découvrais comment ce chocobo était né.${prompt}
  8647: |-
    Selon Shalott, la mère du chocobo vient des écuries de Bastok.
    Comme j'aimerais pouvoir y aller pour la voir moi-même...${prompt}
  8648: |-
    Que puis-je faire pour vous ?
    Si vous voulez monter un chocobo, une des filles là-bas peut vous aider.${prompt}
  8649: Récemment, beaucoup d'aventuriers semblent oublier qu'un chocobo est un animal, pas un objet.${prompt}
  8650: |-
    Gardez cela à l'esprit en profitant de cette promenade facile à travers des terres désolées pleines de monstres.
    Bon voyage.${prompt}
  8651: Un chocobo avec des plumes argentées... ?${prompt}
  8652: Ah, vous parlez de Silver Comet.${prompt}
  8653: Elle était autrefois la monture d'un général hautement gradé dans la marine bastokienne.${prompt}
  8654: Le fils du général a reçu le chocobo comme cadeau de majorité, qu'il a aussitôt utilisé pour quitter Bastok.${prompt}
  8655: Pendant longtemps, personne n'a vu ni l'homme ni la bête, jusqu'à ce que, finalement, Silver Comet revienne en ville... seule.${prompt}
  8656: J'ai appris plus tard que le fils du général avait perdu la vie quelque part dans les terres sauvages.${prompt}
  8657: Seule Silver Comet est revenue indemne.${prompt}
  8658: En mémoire de son fils, le général nous a demandé de prendre soin du chocobo...${prompt}
  8659: |-
    Mais un jour, Silver Comet a disparu.
    Un voleur de chocobos l'avait enlevée.${prompt}
  8660: |-
    Hm ?
    Vous dites qu'un poussin de Silver Comet est gardé dans les écuries de Jeuno ?
    Vous devez vous tromper.${prompt}
  8661: Quoi qu'il en soit, après le vol, le général a exploré toutes les pistes possibles pour retrouver le chocobo de son fils.${prompt}
  8662: Il a finalement trouvé un aventurier qui aurait vu un chocobo en train de se noyer dans les marais de Pashhow.${prompt}
  8663: Ce chocobo avait les mêmes marques que Silver Comet.${prompt}
  8664: Si vous voulez essayer de parler à cet aventurier, vous devriez aller au poste avancé des marais.${prompt}
  8665: |-
    Il semble qu'il ait abandonné la vie d'aventurier.
    Maintenant, il gagne son pain quotidien en s'occupant des besoins des soldats au poste avancé.${prompt}
  8666: La porte est verrouillée.${prompt}
  8667: |-
    Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?
    Je n'ai pas de temps pour les aventuriers.${prompt}
  8668: |-
    Hein ? Où avez-vous entendu...
    Enfin, peu importe.${prompt}
  8669: Vous dites que vous avez des affaires avec moi ?${prompt}
  8670: |-
    Silver Comet...
    Pourquoi venez-vous m'ennuyer avec cette vieille histoire de chocobo ?
    Vous êtes un illuminé ou quoi ?${prompt}
  8671: Laissez-moi tranquille, fou que vous êtes.${prompt}
  8672: "Ne voyez-vous pas que je suis occupé ? \nCe lieu devient trop humide et trop sombre trop vite pour perdre du temps à discuter.${prompt}"
  8673: |-
    Attendez une minute.
    Si vous m'apportez quelques ${item-plural: 1[2]}, je pourrais être disposé à vous accorder un peu de temps.${prompt}
  8674: |-
    Oui, trois de ceux-là devraient suffire.
    Je vous donne jusqu'à après-demain.${prompt}
  8675: |-
    Vous avez apporté ce que j'ai demandé ?
    Faites attention avec ça, c'est vraiment nauséabond.${prompt}
  8676: |-
    Ça sert à masquer l'odeur d'une personne, voyez-vous.
    Ça m'aide à me déplacer.${prompt}
  8677: |-
    Maintenant, alors.
    Vous vouliez entendre parler de ce chocobo, c'est ça ?${prompt}
  8678: |-
    C'était l'un des chocobos les plus rapides sur lesquels j'ai jamais monté, mais quasiment incontrôlable.
    Je ne sais pas comment le propriétaire de Silver Comet la maniait.${prompt}
  8679: |-
    Je suppose que la mort de son ancien propriétaire l'a fait disjoncter.
    Ce chocobo n'avait plus toute sa tête.${prompt}
  8680: |-
    Elle s'est jetée tête baissée dans les marais.
    J'ai pensé que c'était la fin pour moi, je peux vous le dire !
  8681: Quand je l'ai vue dans les écuries, elle portait un collier attaché à une chaîne.${prompt}
  8682: Ce n'était pas pour empêcher le monture du général d'être volée - c'était pour empêcher Silver Comet de s'enfuir, en quelque sorte.${prompt}
  8683: |-
    Ce général est un vrai stratège.
    Il a dit que si on relâchait Silver Comet, elle serait capable de retrouver Shooting Star.${prompt}
  8684: C'est de sa faute si j'ai failli être tué !${prompt}
  8685: |-
    Hein ?
    Qui est Shooting Star ? C'est aussi un chocobo.${prompt}
  8686: Shooting Star était le compagnon de Silver Comet.${prompt}
  8687: Leur amour était une chose pure et sans complications, bien plus que ce que ressentent les gens.${prompt}
  8688: |-
    Ahahaha !
    Je crois que cet huile commence à embrouiller mes sens.
    À la prochaine, aventurier.${prompt}
  8689: Avez-vous pu rencontrer cet aventurier ?${prompt}
  8690: |-
    ...Est-ce vrai ?
    Je pense que vous êtes resté un peu trop longtemps près de ce ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  8691: On dirait que cet aventurier était celui qui a volé Silver Comet en premier lieu.${prompt}
  8692: Ou du moins, on pourrait le croire, si le voleur n'était pas censé s'être noyé dans les marais également.${prompt}
  8693: |-
    Vous avez mentionné un “Shooting Star” ?
    Je connais ce nom.${prompt}
  8694: |-
    Ce chocobo a été élevé aux côtés de Silver Comet.
    Ces deux-là étaient presque inséparables quand ils étaient poussins.${prompt}
  8695: Malheureusement, contrairement à Silver Comet, Shooting Star est mort en sauvant son maître.${prompt}
  8696: |-
    Je suppose que Silver Comet essayait de le retrouver quand elle s'est jetée dans ce marais.
    Le général a mentionné quelque chose de similaire à cette époque, je me souviens.${prompt}
  8697: |-
    Hm ?
    Vous essayez toujours de me convaincre que son poussin est à Jeuno ?${prompt}
  8698: |-
    Je suis désolé, mais je pense vraiment que vous vous trompez.
    Enfin, le général avait même le collier de Silver Comet.${prompt}
  8699: Il a dit qu'il allait le poser sur la tombe de son fils dans les Plaines de Batallia.${prompt}
  8700: |-
    Mais, attendez.
    Je me souviens que ce collier a été envoyé par un homme nommé Brutus.
    Il dirige une écurie de chocobos à Jeuno...${prompt}
  8701: Pourquoi ce collier aurait-il été envoyé de Jeuno si Silver Comet s'était noyée dans les marais de Pashhow ?${prompt}
  8702: Vous êtes attaqué !${prompt}
  8703: Ce n'est pas le moment pour ça !${prompt}
  8704: Vous sentez que quelque chose ne va pas tout à fait...${prompt}
  8705: Vous ne trouvez rien.${prompt}
  8706: Je... Je ne sais pas de quoi vous parlez.${prompt}
  8707: |-
    Waouh...
    Donc ce collier appartenait à la mère de ce chocobo, Silver Comet ?${prompt}
  8708: Je le poserais sur la tombe de son compagnon, Shooting Star, si seulement je savais où elle se trouve.${prompt}
  8709: Donc vous êtes les deux fouineurs qui posaient des questions sur Silver Comet à Shalott.${prompt}
  8710: Ce collier... !?${prompt}
  8711: |-
    Vous avez bien creusé dans cette vieille histoire.
    On dirait qu'après vingt ans, les gens commencent à laisser échapper des choses.${prompt}
  8712: S'il vous plaît, ne soyez pas en colère, Brutus.${prompt}
  8713: J'ai découvert que les chocobos peuvent tomber amoureux, tout comme les gens.${prompt}
  8714: Il y avait une fille qui m'a appris que les animaux et les gens sont pareils.${prompt}
  8715: Je pense que l'histoire de Silver Comet et Shooting Star m'a vraiment aidé à comprendre ce qu'elle voulait dire.${prompt}
  8716: Eh bien, alors, je suppose que je vais devoir vous raconter toute l'histoire.${prompt}
  8717: Silver Comet et Shooting Star n'ont jamais vraiment péri.${prompt}
  8718: Vraiment !?${prompt}
  8719: Shooting Star était un chocobo spécial qui a été attaqué par un homme maléfique.${prompt}
  8720: Il était gravement blessé quand on l'a amené ici, et nous avons tous travaillé dur pour le remettre sur pied.${prompt}
  8721: Mais Shooting Star était toujours poursuivi par cet homme maléfique, alors nous avons dû le cacher.${prompt}
  8722: Nous l'avons emmené dans un endroit à l'ouest des Plaines de Batallia, où ce méchant ne le trouverait jamais.${prompt}
  8723: Mais cet homme était malin. Il savait que s'il avait Silver Comet, son lien avec Shooting Star les conduirait directement à la cachette du chocobo.${prompt}
  8724: Silver Comet était un chocobo très intelligent, cependant.${prompt}
  8725: Elle s'est délibérément jetée dans les marais pour forcer le méchant à descendre de son dos.${prompt}
  8726: C'était extrêmement dangereux pour Silver Comet de faire ça.${prompt}
  8727: |-
    Mais elle n'a jamais abandonné.
    Elle devait protéger son compagnon de l'homme qui voulait lui faire du mal.${prompt}
  8728: |-
    Silver Comet a nagé à travers la boue et s'est dégagée des marais.
    Elle a finalement pu rejoindre Shooting Star.${prompt}
  8729: C'est à ce moment-là que j'ai enlevé son collier et l'ai libérée.${prompt}
  8730: Qu'est-ce qui leur est arrivé après ça ?${prompt}
  8731: Ont-ils vécu heureux pour toujours ?${prompt}
  8732: |-
    Exactement.
    Et le plus jeune de la couvée qu'ils ont élevée ensemble est ce chocobo juste là.${prompt}
  8733: Quelle belle histoire...${prompt}
  8734: |-
    Ce n'est pas fini.
    Le méchant de cette histoire rôde encore quelque part.${prompt}
  8735: "C'est pourquoi vous ne devez jamais dire à qui que ce soit ce que vous avez entendu ici aujourd'hui. \nVous voulez garder ce chocobo en sécurité, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}"
  8736: D'accord !${prompt}
  8737: Je ne dirai jamais rien, je le promets !${prompt}
  8738: |-
    Content de l'entendre.
    Et encore une chose...${prompt}
  8739: N'oublie pas comment Silver Comet n'a jamais abandonné son compagnon.${prompt}
  8740: Même quand ceux qu'ils aiment et en qui ils croient sont partis, les animaux continueront à se battre.${prompt}
  8741: |-
    Exactement.
    C'est parce que les animaux viennent de la même source que les gens.${prompt}
  8742: |-
    Aventurier, tu peux prendre ceci.
    Garde cette histoire pour toi.${prompt}
  8743: |-
    Merci beaucoup !
    Et ceci, c'est de ma part.${prompt}
  8744: Je me demande si cette fille Elvaan sait comment Silver Comet et Shooting Star se sont mariés.${prompt}
  8745: J'aimerais la rencontrer à nouveau un jour...${prompt}
  8746: Appuyez sur n'importe quel bouton pour continuer.${prompt}
  8747: À la demande d'une certaine société, j'enquête sur les effets du redoutable “Vide” sur les êtres vivants.${prompt}
  8748: |-
    Vous semblez être un aventurier bien expérimenté.
    Peut-être avez-vous vu l'une des créatures ravagées par le Vide dont je parle ?${prompt}
  8749: Nous avons étiqueté ces monstruosités “Monstres Notoires du Vide,” ou ENM...${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}

  8751: |-
    Aha, donc vous avez une expérience directe.
    Vous n'avez probablement pas besoin d'explications d'un savant, mais permettez-moi...${prompt}
  8752: La présence matérielle des ENM est devenue temporaire et insubstantielle, ce qui signifie que ceux qui ont été témoins de l'existence d'un ENM particulier ne pourront pas le rencontrer à nouveau avant qu'un certain temps ne soit passé.${prompt}
  8753: |-

    Yes. One of the mirrors was being kept in the Empire of Aht Urhgan, but was eventually lost to the world.
    Or so the tale goes...${prompt}
  9820: It was once stored within a small chest and strrrictly guarded, with only selected people permitted to view the mirror itself.${prompt}
  9821: This looking glass supposedly emitted a light of such heart-stopping beauty, it was almost blinding.${prompt}
  9822: This light was so dazzling, it spilled from the chest and soothed the souls of all who gazed upon it.${prompt}
  9823: And so we can deduce from these properties that the mirror lost to the Aht Urhgan Empire was most likely the Glass of Blessed Radiance.${prompt}
  9824: If this mirror still exists somewhere in the world, I would do anything to track it down!${prompt}
  9825: I'm a sucker for beautiful artifacts. And this tale of divine rrradiance makes me want it even more!${prompt}
  9826: '...This book appears to be of considerable age. You did well to discover such a valuable resource.${prompt}'
  9827: Let's see what it has to say.${prompt}
  9828: “Worshipped in the Near East, there is a small mirror whose creation was ordered by a king, now long deceased.”${prompt}
  9829: “As time passed, the looking glass came to be revered as a holy object, and even while it was kept under guard...”${prompt}
  9830: “...people began to call it the Mirror of Blighted Gloom.”${prompt}
  9831: “The blackened metal of the mirror emits a dim, dark light that conjures images of early evening.”${prompt}
  9832: Hmmm...${prompt}
  9833: |-
    That would suggest to me that the brrroken glass I have now is this Mirror of Blighted Gloom.
    The description fits perfectly.${prompt}
  9834: The explanation continues...${prompt}
  9835: “This metal is like no other substance we have ever encountered.”${prompt}
  9836: “Expert scientists concur that while this substance gives off a metallic glint...”${prompt}
  9837: “...it has a malleable structure at room temperature almost like a liquid. However, for reasons unknown, it is able to maintain its shape.”${prompt}
  9838: “The metal used by the creators of the mirror no longer exists, and as such, it would be impossible to duplicate its creation today.”${prompt}
  9839: |-
    No longer exists...!
    Then how am I supposed to...?${prompt}
  9840: What else does it say?${prompt}
  9841: What else does it say?${prompt}
  9842: What else does it say?${prompt}
  9843: Does it say anything further?${prompt}

  9851: Is there more to the passage?${prompt}
  9852: It continues...${prompt}
  9853: “However, the method for crafting the mirror has been discovered and follows these steps:”${prompt}
  9854: “One. Prepare the metal that is to become the body of the mirror.”${prompt}
  9855: “Two. Find a spring with a surface as smooth as glass. The spring must be filled with clear water.”${prompt}
  9856: |-
    “Three. Chant the charm, and offer a prayer.
    The charm is only known by the guardians of the mirror...”${prompt}
  9857: “If the above steps are followed correctly, an enchanted mirror will be created.”${prompt}
  9858: |-

  10900: Even so, soldiers must be able to follow their commander's orders and fulfill their given roles. Arbitrary decisions can lead an entire army to its doom.${prompt}

    Harumph, do we look like children to you?
    You could have cut that explanation in half and it would have been more than sufficientaru!${prompt}
  10906: All right then. I'll get straight to the point now.${prompt}
  10907: |-
    Oh, give us a break!
    What point could you make?
    All your vague statements and whatnot!
    Why not lend an ear to what I've got?${prompt}
  10908: |-
    No thanks...
    Well then, I shall be frank.${prompt}
  10909: I propose the reinstatement of “Brenner” as a new form of Conflict!${prompt}
  10910: Brenner!?${prompt}
  10911: |-
    I remember that name. Before the Great War, Brenner was used in the selection of the Gold Musketeers.
    However, the competition was extraordinarily fierce, and it is said that the casualties always exceeded the number of successful candidates.${prompt}
  10912: Those stories were fabricated simply to exaggerate the danger of Brenner.${prompt}
  10913: |-
    Brenner was originally created as a training exercise for mineworkers.
    The outcome of each match relied on the participants' skill in role management and encouraged team competition.${prompt}
  10914: Of course, I am not suggesting that we abolish Ballista. I simply advise that we add Brenner to the list of training options in order to supply the elements of teamwork that I find lacking in current matches.${prompt}
  10915: |-
    Hmph, so you wish to fortify your army by tying them tightly together in iron bonds.
    How very-wery Bastokan!${prompt}
  10916: |-
    Ohohoho!
    Still, the idea makes my heart race!
    I even support it. You make a good case!${prompt}
  10917: |-
    Ohohoho!
    So if your weaklings unite,
    you think you can win any fight?${prompt}
  10918: |-
    Oho, this is rich!
    May your plan go without hitch!${prompt}
  10919: |-
    I will support your plan, but please be aware
    that against the black mages, no one's got a prayer!${prompt}
  10920: |-
    If it will supplement Ballista, I believe that even Excenmille would have no argument.
    You have my approval.${prompt}
  10921: |-
    I appreciate your decision.
    Now I also would like to suggest that we do away with the license requirement and nationality restrictions for Brenner.${prompt}
  10922: |-
    Quite a bold statement.
    However, teams would be composed of complete strangers if we enforce what you propose. Is that your desire?${prompt}
  10923: The adventurers have taught me much, but one of the greatest lessons I have learned is the strength of the bond between linkshell members.${prompt}
  10924: Linkshells provide an exemplary model of unity. The cooperation and friendly competition of these groups are like those of the closest companions or even family. And thus, I propose that we introduce matches divided by linkshell rather than nation.${prompt}
  10925: |-
    Interesting. You seem to have worked out these plans more thoroughly than I expected.
    Have you also given consideration to where the matches will be held?${prompt}
  10926: |-
    Of course.
    Wolfgang, shall we invite our guest in now?${prompt}
  10927: A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am called Afdeen.${prompt}
  10928: I have come to your lands by order of the great Abdhaljs.${prompt}
  10929: |-
    By Altana!
    Do you mean to suggest that you are a direct disciple of Sir Abdhaljs? I believe I have heard your name before.${prompt}
  10930: |-
    Is your master in good health?
    He deserves our gratitude for the Diorama...${prompt}
  10931: Yes, he is quite well. However, he desires no reward. He is quite pleased with the Ballista matches that take place each day in the Diorama.${prompt}
  10932: On another note, he has expressed interest in a new form of Conflict. He has entrusted me with matters regarding his new diorama, which is designed after Purgonorgo Isle.${prompt}
  10933: The great Abdhaljs has created a new diorama specifically for this new form of Conflict? Magnificent! You will hear no argument from me.${prompt}
  10934: That's dandy-wandy, but don't forget that Windurst won't lend a single gil to the project!${prompt}
  10935: |-
    Well, there you have it. The preparations sound fine!
    Okay then, inform me when Windurst is next in line!${prompt}
  10936: The reinstatement of Brenner has now been approved!${prompt}
  10937: I will send a detailed explanation of the rules to each of you. If you should have any objections, please take them up with Sir Wolfgang.${prompt}
  10938: Obviously, the citizens of Windurst have the closestaru bond. Our adventurers will have to teach the rest of you a thing or two about teamwork now.${prompt}

    I am simply beside myself--my prayers will not cease!
    Wishing your people get through this in one piece!
    Ohohoho～!${prompt}

    I will not stand for these meaningless insults against the Royal Knights!
    Our records in Ballista prove our prowess in working as a team.${prompt}
  10941: I think it is time to call this meeting to a close. Thank you all for your participation.${prompt}
  10942: How can any idea be interesting when Bastok thoughtaru of it first?${prompt}
  10943: |-
    You're missing the point--this'll make them prepared
    for the time that they're needed, my plans unimpaired!${prompt}
  10944: Your plans? You can't mean...${prompt}
  10945: |-
    Now to just wait and see
    what Brenner will bring to me!${prompt}
  10946: |-
    I'll need many a strong adventurer
    for my grand plans, that's for sure!
    Ohohoho!${prompt}

    Notre compagnie est également autorisée par l'impératrice d'Aht Urhgan.

  11124: Les rumeurs de l'approbation de l'archiduc pour les recruteurs de mercenaires ont augmenté la confiance des gens. C'est peut-être pour cela qu'il y a autant de candidatures pour les Salaheem's Sentinels... malgré leur emplacement lointain, à travers le Gugru Blue.${prompt}
  11125: Peut-être que si je deviens célèbre là-bas en tant que Jeunoan, l'archiduc m'invitera à le rencontrer et me rendra honneur en tant que fierté de son peuple !${prompt}
  11126: Les habitants d'Aht Urhgan ne vénèrent pas Altana. Au lieu de cela, ils adressent leurs prières à une divinité païenne. Quelle pratique vile.${prompt}

  11142: Mais les chocobos sauvages n'existent plus maintenant.${prompt}

  11173: Ils sont beaucoup plus mignons comme ça.${prompt}
  11174: Grâce à vous, les écuries de chocobos vont mieux que jamais. Vous, les aventuriers, faites un excellent travail... Je n'ai jamais vu des animaux aussi beaux !${prompt}

    Voici un petit signe de ma gratitude.
    Je suis sûr que vous pourrez élever un gagnant !${prompt}

  11177: Je vais avoir une autre discussion avec la VCS au sujet de tout ce qui s'est passé. Revenez plus tard et je vous dirai comment ça s'est passé.${prompt}
  11178: Bien joué, ${name-player} ! J'ai une bonne nouvelle à vous annoncer ! La Vana'diel Chocobo Society a pris une grande décision...${prompt}
  11179: Grâce à ${name-player}, le comportement des chocobos est revenu à la normale.${prompt}
  11180: Il est fort probable que nous ayons besoin de l'aide des aventuriers pour d'autres choses à l'avenir.${prompt}

  11186: Eh bien, par consentement unanime, j'approuve désormais la participation des aventuriers à l'élevage de chocobos !${prompt}
  11187: La session est levée !${prompt}
  11188: |-
    ...Et voilà comment cela s'est passé.
    Laisser les aventuriers participer devrait vraiment dynamiser les écuries de chocobos !${prompt}

  11423: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  11424: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  11425: “Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt}
  11426: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  11427: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}
  11428: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt}
  11429: 'If you really want to raise your chocobo''s affection quickly, you can give it ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but I can''t recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.${prompt}'
  11430: “Satisfaction” is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.${prompt}
  11431: However, when the chocobo is very hungry, its energy will hardly recover at all and its affection will rapidly decrease.${prompt}

    Nothing.${prompt}
  11433: A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.${prompt}
  11434: How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.${prompt}
  11435: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt}
  11436: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt}
  11437: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt}
  11438: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt}
  11439: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  11440: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  11441: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  11442: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  11443: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  11444: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  11445: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11446: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt}
  11447: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11448: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  11449: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  11450: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11451: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  11452: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  11453: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  11454: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  11455: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt}
  11456: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}
  11457: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt}
  11458: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  11459: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  11460: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt}
  11461: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt}
  11462: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  11463: You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.${prompt}
  11464: You will receive payment in accordance with the chocobo's performance. However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}

    Taking a walk.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  11466: In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  11467: Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt}
  11468: On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt}
  11469: However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt}
  11470: You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  11471: Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt}
  11472: You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.${prompt}
  11473: I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt}
  11474: Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt}
  11475: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt}
  11476: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt}
  11477: You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt}
  11478: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt}
  11479: Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!${prompt}

    Vegetables.
    Wildgrasses.
    Carrots.
    Worms.
    Medicines.
    Pastes.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  11481: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt}
  11482: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt}
  11483: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  11484: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  11485: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}
  11486: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt}
  11487: 'Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt}'

  11489: 'Chocobos also seem to enjoy ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  11490: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt}
  11491: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt}
  11492: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt}'
  11493: 'In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It''s a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt}'
  11494: Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.${prompt}
  11495: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, for example, affect the chocobo''s physical attributes, and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are good for its mental attributes. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are in a category of their own.${prompt}'
  11496: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  11497: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  11498: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'
  11499: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt}
  11500: 'The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt}'
  11501: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  11502: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo''s energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt}'
  11503: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt}'
  11504: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt}
  11505: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}
  11506: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt}

    Which would you like to ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Abilities.
    Temperament.
    Weather preferences.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  11509: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  11510: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  11511: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  11512: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  11513: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  11514: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  11515: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  11516: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  11517: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  11518: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}
  11519: 'When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  11520: 'You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  11521: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt}
  11522: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt}
  11523: 'You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}'
  11524: 'You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11525: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt}
  11526: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11527: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  11528: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt}

    Tu veux devenir danseur ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui, sûrement.
    Non, j'ai deux pieds gauches.${prompt}
  11802: |-
    Merveilleux.
    Essaye de ne pas trébucher sur toi-même en sortant.${prompt}
  11803: <Soupir>... encore un autre.${prompt}
  11804: Écoute bien. J'ai sélectionné chaque membre de la Troupe Brilioth pour des raisons de style et de grâce.${prompt}
  11805: Ce n'est pas un melting-pot d'animation comme une certaine Troupe Valeriano.${prompt}
  11806: |-
    Je ne peux pas laisser entrer n'importe quel Galka lourd ou Hume sans rythme qui passe la porte.
    Si c'est des cours de danse que tu veux, va demander à ta tante.${prompt}

    Je vais aller rendre visite à Tante...
    Jamais !${prompt}

    Tu es un ${choice-player-gender}[garçon/fille] têtu, c'est sûr.

    Et quel genre de roche est-ce, tu demandes ?
    Eh bien, ça, c'est à toi de le découvrir.${prompt}

  11811: Régale-toi des magnifiques pas de la Troupe Brilioth !${prompt}
  11812: |-
    J'ai commencé à étudier ici après qu'une des performances de Laila m'ait émue aux larmes.
    Tellement de grâce...tellement de talent...${prompt}
  11813: |-
    J'ai entendu que tu parlais avec Laila.
    Donc, tu penses pouvoir danser ?${prompt}
  11814: Tu devras montrer que tu es absolument déterminé avant qu'elle ne pense même à t'adopter sous son aile.${prompt}
  11815: 'Peut-être que je pourrais demander à Laila des indices sur ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. Mais comment puis-je être sûr que tu es vraiment sérieux...?${prompt}'
  11816: |-
    Je sais !
    As-tu entendu parler de la taverne Lion Springs à San d'Oria ?${prompt}
  11817: Si tu as le courage de danser sur cette scène, cela prouvera que tu as une passion pour la performance.${prompt}
  11818: 'Si tu as le courage de danser sur la scène de la taverne Lion Springs, je demanderai à Laila ce que je sais sur ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  11819: Cela devait être une performance incroyable que tu as donnée à la taverne Lion Springs. La nouvelle de ton “style de danse unique” est allée jusqu'à Jeuno.${prompt}
  11820: Eh bien, je suppose que je dois tenir ma parole et te dire ce que j'ai appris sur cette pierre.${prompt}
  11821: 'Je déteste te briser la nouvelle, mais trouver ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} pourrait être presque impossible.${prompt}'
  11822: 'Il y a vingt ans, ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} pouvaient être trouvés au fond du lac Mechieume dans la forêt de Jugner.${prompt}'
  11823: Mais leur éclat éblouissant en a fait un objet de collection tellement prisé qu'il n'en reste plus un seul aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  11824: Je crois que notre leader impitoyable t'a assigné une tâche impossible à réaliser.${prompt}
  11825: |-
    C'est dommage.
    Bien que tu manques encore de compétence, tu as certainement l'esprit d'un danseur...${prompt}
  11826: Tu es encore là ?${prompt}
  11827: "Tu m'as rapporté ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} ?\nSi tu penses pouvoir me tromper avec un morceau peint de...${prompt} "

  11831: |-
    <Soupir>...
    Eh bien, tu as été à la hauteur de la tâche, sans aucun doute.
    Bienvenue dans la Troupe Brilioth.${prompt}
  11832: 'Tu sais, j’ai un autre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, mais sa lumière s’est éteinte il y a des années...${prompt}'

  11835: '...?${prompt}'
  11836: Tu me sembles étrangement familier pour une raison...${prompt}
  11837: Non, ça ne peut pas être...${prompt}
  11838: Maintenant, avant de commencer ton entraînement, laisse-moi te raconter un peu l'origine de notre danse.${prompt}
  11839: C'est un style martial basé sur le "Kriegstanz" traditionnel bastokien -- une danse utilisée lors des batailles réelles.${prompt}
  11840: Bien sûr, nous avons appris à adapter ce style martial en une forme adaptée aux performances.${prompt}
  11841: Mais d'abord, tu devras travailler les mouvements de base, martiaux.${prompt}
  11842: |-
    Rhea !
    Montre à ce rookie comment faire !${prompt}
  11843: Et maintenant, ton corps a été conditionné pour les mouvements fondamentaux du Kriegstanz.${prompt}
  11844: |-
    Ne reste pas là à traîner des pieds !
    Je m'attends à ce que tu passes chaque moment libre à pratiquer ces mouvements !
    La Troupe Brilioth n'accepte que les meilleurs !${prompt}
  11845: Tu peux maintenant devenir danseur !${prompt}
  11846: |-
    La danse s'apprend en la pratiquant, pas en la regardant.
    Bouge ton corps et danse jusqu'à ce que tu tombes !${prompt}
  11847: |-
    Qu'est-ce que tu regardes ?
    Je ne distribue pas d'autographes.${prompt}
  11848: 'Je suis content que tu aies rejoint notre petit groupe, mais sois averti : le travail difficile ne fait que commencer !${prompt}'
  11849: |-
    Elles sont tellement belles !
    J'aimerais aussi devenir danseuse un jour !${prompt}
  11850: Deux jeunes filles sur le champ de bataille... et un Galka ?${prompt}
  11851: Il y a beaucoup de "danseurs", mais seuls quelques-uns sont vraiment brillants.${prompt}
  11852: |-
    Et parmi ces brillants élus, on dit que le plus talentueux et gracieux est visité par la Divinité de la Danse.
    Cela pourrait-il être vrai ?${prompt}
  11853: J'ai beaucoup appris sur la Guerre du Cristal en m'occupant d'Ilumida.${prompt}
  11854: Elle m'a même parlé de ces horribles statues que les gens appellent "les gouffres".${prompt}
  11855: Je n'ai pas vécu cette expérience moi-même, mais on dit que rien que la vue de ces idoles ravive les souvenirs les plus horribles de la guerre...${prompt}
  11856: |-
    Je me demande s'il existe d'autres choses dans le monde qui rappellent aux gens cette époque horrible.
    Si seulement de telles atrocités pouvaient être enterrées pour toujours.${prompt}
  11857: Est-ce que les bêtes ont aussi un dieu à qui elles prient, de la même manière que nous demandons les bénédictions d'Altana ?${prompt}
  11858: |-
    Bien que je ne sois pas sûr de vouloir savoir quelles prières tordues les bêtes pourraient faire.
    Et toi ?${prompt}
  11859: Pourquoi, ce n'est pas ${name-player} ? T'as bien travaillé sur tes pas, hein ?${prompt}
  11860: Pourquoi tu ne me montres pas quelques-uns de tes mouvements ? Allez, laisse-moi voir.${prompt}
  11861: Hmmm... des pas nets, confiants, et un excellent équilibre du haut du corps en prime. Sans aucun doute, tu t'es amélioré.${prompt}
  11862: On dirait que tu as fidèlement répété les bases de notre style martial, le “Kriegstanz”.${prompt}
  11863: Mais ta danse manque encore d'un certain... "éclat".${prompt}
  11864: Écoute bien. Ce que la Troupe Brilioth cherche, c'est un style de danse qui captive et envoûte.${prompt}
  11865: Je veux que tu réfléchisses à comment tu pourrais faire briller ta danse.${prompt}
  11866: Ce que la Troupe Brilioth cherche, c'est un style de danse qui captive et envoûte.${prompt}
  11867: Quoi ? Tu veux savoir ce qui manque dans ta danse ?${prompt}
  11868: C'est une question difficile... Personnellement, je crois que tu t'es énormément amélioré.${prompt}
  11869: Laila m'a un jour parlé de son enfance. Le Witchfire Glen, à Grauberg, était l'endroit où sa mère lui apprenait à danser. Elle disait que c'était là qu'elle avait appris l'essence véritable de la danse.${prompt}
  11870: Pendant la Grande Guerre, on disait que le Witchfire Glen était un lieu mystique, où des fées pouvaient être vues en train de gambader.${prompt}
  11871: La mère de Laila ne sélectionnait que les danseurs les plus talentueux, et les formait là-bas. J'aurais adoré faire partie de ces leçons !${prompt}
  11872: Désolé de ne pas avoir pu t'aider à pimenter tes pas...${prompt}
  11873: La mère de Laila ne sélectionnait que les danseurs les plus talentueux, et les formait au Witchfire Glen, à Grauberg.${prompt}
  11874: Alors, ${name-player}. As-tu trouvé comment faire briller ta danse ?${prompt}
  11875: Tu penses avoir ce qu'il faut maintenant ? Allez, montre-nous un peu.${prompt}
  11876: Eh bien, eh bien, c'était quelque chose.${prompt}
  11877: |-
    “Une danse magistrale peut être l'arme la plus létale ; un combat habile, la danse la plus élégante.”
    Ce sont les mots de ma chère mère.${prompt}
  11878: Mais il y a une différence essentielle entre danser sur scène, et danser au combat.${prompt}
  11879: Sur scène, tu danses devant un public, dans le but de leur apporter un sourire.${prompt}
  11880: Ton désir de divertir et de plaire au public est ce qui fait briller ta danse. N'oublie pas ça.${prompt}
  11881: Laila ! Je viens de rencontrer Wyatt, le gars qui gère une entreprise de promotion de troupes de performance...${prompt}
  11882: Il m'a dit que la Troupe Valeriano est la prochaine à se produire ici, à Jeuno.${prompt}
  11883: La Troupe Valeriano... à Jeuno !?${prompt}
  11884: Apparemment, le chef de la troupe veut venir te parler quand ils arriveront.${prompt}
  11885: Quel genre d'affaire une troupe comme Valeriano pourrait-elle bien avoir avec moi ?${prompt}
  11886: '...${prompt}'
  11887: Hé hé, ça suffit les rêveries ! Retourne à tes répétitions !${prompt}
  11888: Je ne tolérerai pas que tu te ridiculises devant la Troupe Valeriano !${prompt}
  11889: Je me demande pourquoi elle est devenue si grincheuse tout à coup.${prompt}
  11890: Il y a à peine un instant, elle chantait tes louanges, ${name-player}, et elle m'a même demandé de préparer quelque chose pour toi.${prompt}
  11891: Je ne pensais pas que la nouvelle la contrarierait autant... Pas de nouvelles, bonnes nouvelles, hein ?${prompt}
  11892: Assez de rêveries ! ${name-player}, je veux voir plus de “brillance” dans cette danse !${prompt}
  11893: Je me demande pourquoi elle est devenue si grincheuse tout à coup...${prompt}
  11894: Tu répètes dur, ${name-player} ?${prompt}
  11895: Montre-moi tes progrès de temps en temps, hein ?${prompt}
  11896: Hmmm...${prompt}
  11897: Pas mal, mais tu as encore du chemin à faire si tu veux devenir la diva de la troupe de danse.${prompt}
  11898: As-tu déjà dansé sur la musique d'un musicien ?${prompt}
  11899: Sur scène, un danseur doit être en harmonie avec les musiciens qui jouent l'accompagnement.${prompt}
  11900: Même quand tu répètes, tu dois visualiser la musique dans ta tête, sinon tu deviendras un danseur égocentrique.${prompt}
  11901: Et je te garantis que les danseurs égocentriques ne vont pas très loin.${prompt}
  11902: Pour devenir un danseur de haut niveau, tu dois travailler avec un musicien de haut niveau. Je te conseille de trouver un bon musicien qui jouera une mélodie pour que tu danses.${prompt}
  11903: Laisse-moi te raconter une histoire. Quand j'étais petite, une fois j'ai sauté une répétition et me suis faufilée vers un lac dans la forêt de Jugner. C'est là que mes oreilles ont été envoûtées par une mélodie de pipe merveilleuse. Sa mélodie envoûtante est encore vive dans mon esprit à ce jour.${prompt}
  11904: Même si je n'ai jamais vu la personne qui jouait, cette rencontre fortuite m'a fait devenir la danseuse que je suis aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  11905: Si seulement je savais qui jouait cette mélodie, je pourrais partager son inspiration avec toi, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11906: "<Soupir> \nC'était il y a tellement longtemps...${prompt}"
  11907: Si tu veux devenir une danseuse de premier plan, tu ferais bien de trouver un musicien de premier plan avec qui travailler.${prompt}
  11908: J'aimerais pouvoir rencontrer un musicien splendide qui saurait jouer sur mes cordes sensibles.${prompt}
  11909: Tu dis que tu as rencontré un barde qui a joué une mélodie pour que tu danses ?${prompt}
  11910: Eh bien, voyons voir comment tu t'es améliorée.${prompt}
  11911: '...!${prompt}'
  11912: C-c'était incroyable !${prompt}
  11913: Ce barde que tu as rencontré devait vraiment être quelque chose.${prompt}
  11914: Il est grand temps que tu reçoives ceci.${prompt}
  11915: Tu as fait du chemin, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11916: 'Honnêtement, le jour où tu as apporté le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} et que j’ai dû t’accepter dans la Troupe Brilioth, je ne savais pas comment tu allais tourner.${prompt}'
  11917: Mais tu as dépassé toutes les attentes.${prompt}
  11918: Oui, c'est dommage, mais la pierre que tu as apportée a perdu son éclat.${prompt}
  11919: La même chose est arrivée à la pierre que j'ai avec moi depuis des années. Vois-tu ?${prompt}
  11920: Quoi...!?${prompt}
  11921: Excusez-moi, mais vous êtes la Troupe Brilioth, n'est-ce pas ? C'est un honneur de vous rencontrer.${prompt}
  11922: V-Valeriano !${prompt}
  11923: Quoi ? C'est vraiment... Laila ? C'est bien toi, n'est-ce pas !${prompt}
  11924: Vous vous connaissez, Laila ?${prompt}
  11925: N-non...${prompt}
  11926: Tu ne te souviens pas ? Il y a dix ans... tu es venue me voir en voulant rejoindre la Troupe Valeriano.${prompt}
  11927: Impossible !!!${prompt}
  11928: C'est vrai, Laila ?${prompt}
  11929: "<Soupir> \nJe suppose qu'il n'y a pas de raison de le cacher...${prompt}"
  11930: Mon, mon, quelle danseuse splendide tu es devenue ! Quand j'ai entendu la nouvelle de Wyatt à propos de la prometteuse nouvelle troupe de danse, j'ai eu un pressentiment que tu en serais la responsable, Laila.${prompt}
  11931: Et une si belle troupe de danse sous tes ailes ! Maintenant, je suis certain que c'était la bonne décision de te refuser il y a dix ans.${prompt}
  11932: J'attendais avec impatience de te voir danser à nouveau, Laila. Je te verrai bientôt sur scène !${prompt}
  11933: Laila... Ce qu'il vient de dire...${prompt}
  11934: Tout ça est vrai, Rhea.${prompt}
  11935: Sauf une chose... Il ne m'a jamais, jamais vue danser. Comment peut-il attendre de me voir « à nouveau » danser s'il ne m'a même jamais vue... ne serait-ce qu'une fois ?${prompt}
  11936: Quelle horreur !${prompt}
  11937: Il y a dix ans, ma mère a monté une grande production de danse, et j'ai été choisie pour le rôle principal.${prompt}
  11938: C'était le moment le plus fier de ma vie. C'était d'autant plus spécial que Maman était une professeure stricte qui ne faisait aucun privilège à personne, pas même à sa propre fille.${prompt}
  11939: Peu de temps après mes débuts en tant que tête d'affiche, la Troupe Valeriano est arrivée en ville.${prompt}
  11940: À l'époque déjà, la Troupe Valeriano était un cirque d'envergure, avec des musiciens ainsi que des danseurs dans son répertoire.${prompt}
  11941: Leurs performances étaient un succès tant auprès des jeunes que des vieux.${prompt}
  11942: C'était le premier cirque que j'avais jamais vu de ma vie, et j'étais complètement sous le charme.${prompt}
  11943: Lorsque le moment est venu de plier bagage et de partir, j'étais déterminée à les rejoindre. Je voulais tellement rejoindre la Troupe Valeriano que je ne tenais pas compte des objections autour de moi.${prompt}
  11944: Attendez !${prompt}
  11945: Et vous êtes...?${prompt}
  11946: Je m'appelle Laila Brilioth, et je suis la meilleure danseuse de la ville !${prompt}
  11947: Ah, oui...${prompt}
  11948: Je suis allé voir les performances de votre troupe, et j'ai bien aimé ce que j'ai vu !${prompt}
  11949: Eh bien, je suis heureux de l'entendre. Merci.${prompt}
  11950: J'ai donc décidé de vous rejoindre.${prompt}
  11951: Vraiment...${prompt}
  11952: Votre troupe sera tellement mieux avec moi en danseuse.${prompt}
  11953: Merci pour votre offre...${prompt}
  11954: Mais, non merci.${prompt}
  11955: Hein...?${prompt}
  11956: Je suis désolé, mais je ne peux pas vous accepter dans notre troupe.${prompt}
  11957: Je ne comprends pas... Pourquoi ne voulez-vous pas m'accepter ?${prompt}
  11958: Si vous me regardiez danser, vous verriez à quel point je suis douée !${prompt}
  11959: J'ai déjà pris ma décision, donc cela ne sera pas nécessaire. Je suis vraiment désolé...${prompt}
  11960: '...${prompt}'
  11961: "<Reniflement> \nQuelle histoire bouleversante...${prompt}"
  11962: Pas longtemps après, un grand incendie a détruit la tente de la Troupe Valeriano et tout leur matériel. Les membres ont été forcés de se séparer.${prompt}
  11963: Tous les danseurs sont partis aussi.${prompt}
  11964: Ce fut un grand revers, et je ressens sincèrement leur malheur. Mais, je n'ai jamais oublié l'humiliation que j'ai ressentie quand j'ai été rejetée.${prompt}
  11965: Après l'incident, j'ai quitté la maison et formé la Troupe Brilioth.${prompt}
  11966: J'étais déterminée à surpasser la Troupe Valeriano, et j'ai fait tout ce que je pouvais pour arriver là où je suis aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  11967: Je suis fière de ce que j'ai accompli. Mais par-dessus tout, je suis fière de vous tous.${prompt}
  11968: Je n'ai jamais oublié l'humiliation que j'ai ressentie quand j'ai été rejetée par Valeriano.${prompt}
  11969: Je ne savais pas que Laila avait croisé la route de la Troupe Valeriano dans le passé...${prompt}
  11970: Je n'arrive pas à croire que la Troupe Valeriano ait rejeté une grande danseuse comme Laila... Qu'est-ce qu'ils pensaient ?${prompt}
  11971: ${name-player}, juste l'aventurier que je cherchais.${prompt}
  11972: Je pensais qu'il était temps que tu montes sur scène, et...${prompt}
  11973: '...?${prompt}'
  11974: Salut tout le monde ! Vous devez être la Troupe Brilioth !${prompt}
  11975: Et qui êtes-vous donc ?${prompt}
  11976: Le nom est Wyatt, et je travaille dans le secteur des spectacles. Boy, j'ai une proposition pour vous !${prompt}
  11977: Pour ma prochaine production, j'ai organisé la venue de la Troupe Valeriano pour se produire ici à Jeuno.${prompt}
  11978: Et je pensais à moi-même, ce serait magnifique si les troupes Brilioth et Valeriano pouvaient collaborer dans un spectacle de cirque et de danse !${prompt}
  11979: Voici les détails de ma proposition... Alors, qu'en pensez-vous ?${prompt}
  11980: Ça semble intéressant... Mais qu'en pense la Troupe Valeriano ?${prompt}
  11981: Eh bien, madame, c'est justement le problème... La Troupe Valeriano est occupée à faire la tournée des trois nations, donc je n'ai pas encore eu l'occasion de leur en parler correctement.${prompt}
  11982: Pourquoi ne nous laissez-vous pas faire ça ? On ira les informer pour vous.${prompt}
  11983: Eh bien, n'est-ce pas gentil ! Je vous serais très reconnaissant si vous pouviez leur transmettre la proposition. Je suppose qu'on se verra plus tard alors.${prompt}
  11984: ${name-player}, je veux que tu prennes cette proposition et que tu la remettes au magasin de musique des Marchés de Bastok, et que tu la passes au propriétaire de l'établissement.${prompt}
  11985: Valeriano va souvent là-bas, m'a-t-on dit.${prompt}
  11986: 'Passe ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} au propriétaire du magasin de musique des Marchés de Bastok. Valeriano est censé être un client habituel.${prompt}'
  11987: Pourquoi Laila a-t-elle accepté une collaboration ? Je pensais qu'elle n'aimait pas la Troupe Valeriano...${prompt}
  11988: Oh là là... Rien que d'y penser, danser aux côtés de la Troupe Valeriano me donne des papillons dans le ventre.${prompt}
  11989: Quoi ? Tu as rencontré Valeriano lui-même au magasin de musique ?${prompt}
  11990: Alors... qu'est-ce qu'il a pensé de la proposition ?${prompt}
  11991: Vraiment ? Il était aussi enthousiaste ? Eh bien, n'est-ce pas adorable...${prompt}
  11992: Hahahahahaaa !${prompt}
  11993: J'ai attendu ce jour pendant si longtemps... le jour où je surpasserai Valeriano.${prompt}
  11994: Quand Wyatt est venu ici et nous a parlé de son plan, j'ai à peine pu contenir mon excitation.${prompt}
  11995: Inutile de dire que tu danseras avec nous aussi, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11996: C'est l'occasion rêvée...${prompt}
  11997: Nous allons montrer à la Troupe Valeriano qui le public préfère.${prompt}
  11998: Ça me rappelle, tu n'as jamais joué sur scène avant, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  11999: Si tu demandes à Rhea Myuliah, elle te donnera des astuces et des conseils pour plaire au public quand tu danses.${prompt}
  12000: Nous dansons pour de vrai cette fois, alors pas de paresse avant la performance !${prompt}
  12001: Pas de paresse avant la performance !${prompt}
  12002: Une collaboration, c'est une chose, mais un face-à-face ? Que peut bien penser Laila ?${prompt}
  12003: Pour la prochaine performance, nous danserons avec la Troupe Valeriano qui se produira à côté de nous.${prompt}
  12004: "Le but de cette collaboration est de permettre au public de profiter à la fois de spectacles de cirque et de danse simultanément... \nMais Laila est déterminée à surpasser la Troupe Valeriano.${prompt}"
  12005: Nous devons donc performer un style de danse qui plaira et attirera l'attention du public.${prompt}
  12006: Juste pour vous donner une idée générale...${prompt}
  12007: Les jeunes préfèrent généralement la valse, les personnes âgées sont plus fans de samba, tandis que les petits ne se lassent pas des jigs.${prompt}
  12008: Pendant que tu danses, observe quel type de public regarde la performance du cirque de la Troupe Valeriano, puis danse un style qui correspond à leurs goûts.${prompt}
  12009: Si tu fais cela, le public tournera sûrement son attention vers la performance de la Troupe Brilioth à la place.${prompt}
  12010: Mais tu ne dois pas négliger ceux qui nous regardent déjà.${prompt}
  12011: Si un style de danse n'est pas à leur goût, ce n'est qu'une question de temps avant que le public ne tourne son attention ailleurs.${prompt}
  12012: Est-ce que ça a du sens ? Tu veux t'entraîner ?${prompt}
  12013: |-
    Pratiquer pour plaire au public ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Allons-y !
    Peut-être plus tard...${prompt}
  12014: Je sais ce que tu ressens... Compétir pour le public n'est pas ma conception du plaisir non plus, mais faisons de notre mieux, d'accord ?${prompt}
  12015: Très bien, je vais faire semblant d'être la Troupe Valeriano... bien que je ne sache pas jongler ou quoi que ce soit.${prompt}
  12016: |-
    Qu'est-ce que tu vas danser ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Valse
    Samba
    Jig${prompt}
  12017: Hrrrm... Sans vouloir t'offenser, ${name-player}, mais à ce rythme, je pense que mon jonglage attirera plus de monde.${prompt}
  12018: C'était génial, ${name-player} ! Laila sera contente si tu continues sur cette lancée.${prompt}
  12019: Excusez notre retard. J'espère que vous n'avez pas trop attendu.${prompt}
  12020: J'ai attendu dix longues années. Quelques minutes de plus ne feront aucune différence.${prompt}
  12021: Hm...? Je ne suis pas sûr de comprendre.${prompt}
  12022: Valeriano, aujourd'hui c'est le jour où je vais te faire regretter de m'avoir rejetée !${prompt}
  12023: L-Laila...${prompt}
  12024: ${name-player}, tu te souviens comment plaire au public ?${prompt}
  12025: |-
    Tu te souviens ?
    ${selection-lines}

    Euh...${prompt}
  12026: Je ne t'avais pas demandé de te préparer pour aujourd'hui ? Rhea, donne à ${name-player} un petit rappel !${prompt}
  12027: Tout de suite, Laila.${prompt}
  12028: Tu as compris ?${prompt}
  12029: Donne au public ce qu'il veut pour qu'il nous regarde et non la Troupe Valeriano !${prompt}
  12030: Assez parlé. ${name-player}, montre-leur ce que tu as !${prompt}
  12031: "Très bien alors... \n${name-player} ! C'est l'heure du spectacle !!!${prompt}"
  12032: Laila, on a perdu presque tout le public au profit de la Troupe Valeriano !${prompt}
  12033: Grrr... On gardera le reste pour demain. Ce n'est pas encore fini...${prompt}
  12034: On leur montrera la prochaine fois.${prompt}
  12035: Perdre contre la Troupe Valeriano comme ça... <Sigh>${prompt}
  12036: On t'a laissé facile hier, mais plus maintenant ! Aujourd'hui, je vais te faire regretter de m'avoir rejetée pour rejoindre la Troupe Valeriano !${prompt}
  12037: Monsieur, les danseurs ont volé notre public...${prompt}
  12038: (Laila, qu'est-il devenu de toi... ?)${prompt}
  12039: (Ce n'est pas ce que j'avais imaginé... Ce n'est pas ce que je suis venu chercher...)${prompt}
  12040: (Ce que je voulais... c'était...)${prompt}
  12041: Cette pipe...?${prompt}
  12042: Cela pourrait-il être vrai...?${prompt}
  12043: Il y a bien des années, c'est toi qui jouais de la pipe au lac Mechieume...${prompt}
  12044: Tu as déjà entendu le son argenté de la pipe du boss ?${prompt}
  12045: Aye... Il y a longtemps, quand j'étais encore enfant...${prompt}
  12046: |-
    Je suis née fille d'une famille de danseurs renommée, et j'ai grandi en plein cœur de la Guerre du Cristal...
    La danse était ma vie, et tout ce que je connaissais. Mais un jour, j'en ai eu marre des entraînements sans fin, et j'ai décidé de fuir à la maison.${prompt}
  12047: C'est à ce moment-là que j'ai entendu la pipe pour la première fois, près du lac Mechieume. Sa mélodie envoûtante a traversé mon âme, guidant chaque pas, chaque tour et pirouette...${prompt}
  12048: Elle a ravivé ma passion vacillante pour la danse et m'a inspiré à continuer. Tout ce que j'ai, je le dois à cette pipe.${prompt}
  12049: Je n'ai pas oublié ce jour, Laila... le jour où je t'ai vue danser pour la première fois.${prompt}
  12050: Tu nous observais...?${prompt}
  12051: C'était la plus belle chose que j'aie jamais eu le privilège de voir.${prompt}
  12052: Quand ${name-player} m'a remis la proposition à Bastok, j'ai remercié la Déesse de m'avoir donné la chance de te voir danser à nouveau.${prompt}
  12053: '......${prompt}'
  12054: B-bien sûr, mais je ne peux pas le faire... Je n'en ai plus la force. Depuis le jour où tu m'as rejetée, mon seul but dans la vie a été de te surpasser.${prompt}
  12055: La seule raison pour laquelle j'ai dansé toutes ces années, c'était pour pouvoir te regarder de haut. Je-je ne mérite pas d'être danseuse...${prompt}
  12056: C'est moi qui suis responsable de t'avoir causé tant de douleur. S'il te plaît, pardonne-moi, Laila.${prompt}
  12057: Mais... je crois toujours fermement que j'ai pris la bonne décision. Ce serait mal d'accepter la danseuse la plus prometteuse que Vana'diel ait jamais vue dans notre troupe.${prompt}
  12058: Quoi...?${prompt}
  12059: Tu as grandi entourée de gens qui t'aimaient, et tu étais destinée à devenir la successeure du fameux style Brilioth.${prompt}
  12060: Bien que jeune, ton talent était déjà incomparable. Jamais une danseuse aussi jeune n'avait été choisie pour diriger la production de ta mère--même moi, je le savais...${prompt}
  12061: Mais je n'avais pas le droit de t'arracher à l'endroit où tu devais être.${prompt}
  12062: Tu méritais bien plus que ce que j'aurais pu t'offrir dans ma troupe.${prompt}
  12063: Aucun chapiteau de cirque ne pourrait jamais être assez grand pour que tu puisses grandir et réaliser ton potentiel, Laila...${prompt}
  12064: Alors... tu m'as rejetée non pas parce que tu pensais que je n'étais pas assez bien ?${prompt}
  12065: La réponse est claire, Laila. Tu es tout ce qu'un danseur pourrait rêver d'être.${prompt}
  12066: Je regrette de ne pas avoir expliqué ma décision plus clairement quand je t'ai rejetée.${prompt}
  12067: Même si tu l'avais fait, je ne pense pas que j'aurais compris...${prompt}
  12068: Je voulais tellement rejoindre la Troupe Valeriano, j'ai perdu de vue tout ce qui comptait pour moi...${prompt}
  12069: J'étais--et je suis--juste une stupide fille...${prompt}
  12070: Tu n'as pas à avoir honte.${prompt}
  12071: Regarde juste la merveilleuse troupe de danse que tu as créée ! Jette un œil à tous ces fans qui t'aiment !${prompt}
  12072: V-Valeriano...${prompt}
  12073: Laila... Accepteras-tu l'honneur de danser pour moi ? Comme à cette époque, il y a tant d'années ?${prompt}
  12074: Oui !${prompt}
  12075: Je n'ai jamais autant pris de plaisir à performer qu'aujourd'hui. J'ai vraiment hâte de notre prochaine collaboration.${prompt}
  12076: D'accord tout le monde, il est temps de partir.${prompt}
  12077: Hm ?${prompt}
  12078: Ce caillou...${prompt}
  12079: 'Le jumeau de mon ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}... Alors tu l’avais avec toi tout ce temps.${prompt}'
  12080: Ils se sont enfin retrouvés...${prompt}
  12081: Je vais repartir à zéro. Comme le jour où j'ai trouvé ce caillou près du lac.${prompt}
  12082: Je suis sûr qu'il ne faudra pas vingt autres années avant que je ne te voie danser à nouveau. Je te souhaite tout le meilleur, Laila.${prompt}
  12083: Est-ce que mes yeux me jouent des tours ? Est-ce que cela pourrait réellement être... vrai ?${prompt}
  12084: De quoi je parle ?${prompt}
  12085: Tu vois, il y a une légende qui dit que les danseurs les plus talentueux et gracieux sont visités par la Divinité de la Danse.${prompt}
  12086: Mais je n'y ai jamais vraiment cru jusqu'à aujourd'hui... Juste maintenant, quand Laila dansait, j'aurais juré...${prompt}
  12087: Mais avant que j'oublie, Laila voulait te donner quelque chose, ${name-player}. Pourquoi ne pas aller lui parler ?${prompt}
  12088: Ce fut une sacrée première performance, ${name-player}. Tu ne cesses de m'impressionner.${prompt}
  12089: Rien n'est plus vrai que "l'entraînement fait le maître". Tiens, ceci est pour tout ton travail acharné.${prompt}
  12090: J'ai été un idiot toutes ces années, en utilisant la danse juste pour essayer de réparer mon ego brisé.${prompt}
  12091: C'est un peu embarrassant à admettre, mais cela fait longtemps que je n'ai pas pris autant de plaisir à danser.${prompt}
  12092: Comme j'aimerais pouvoir danser à nouveau aux côtés de Valeriano...${prompt}
  12093: Tiens, prends ceci. Tu le mérites pour tout ton travail acharné.${prompt}
  12094: La danse peut parfois être insaisissable--plus tu cherches, plus tu perds de vue ce que tu veux...${prompt}
  12095: Quand cela arrive, vide tous les pensées inutiles de ton esprit et tout ira bien.${prompt}
  12096: Je vais m'efforcer de devenir une grande danseuse comme Laila.${prompt}
  12097: Mon dieu ! Je ne me souviens pas de la dernière fois où je me suis autant amusée !${prompt}
  12098: |-
    Tu es tellement jolie !
    J'aimerais être danseuse comme toi un jour !${prompt}
  12099: Je me souviens d'une époque pendant la Guerre des Cristaux où je me suis retrouvé entouré par l'ennemi au combat. J'avais perdu tout espoir quand les danseurs Musiciens de Terrain sont venus à ma rescousse.${prompt}
  12100: Avec à peine plus qu'un geste gracieux de leurs bras, mes blessures ont été guéries et mes douleurs apaisées. On aurait dit que la Déesse elle-même était descendue de son royaume céleste...${prompt}
  12101: |-
    La performance était émouvante au-delà des mots.
    Je n'ai pas un doute dans mon cœur que la Divinité de la Danse existe...${prompt}
  12102: Tu t'entraînes dur comme d'habitude, ${name-player} ?${prompt}
  12103: 'J’ai voulu te demander, as-tu déjà entendu parler de ${item-plural: 0[2]} ?${prompt}'
  12104: Ce sont des marques que la Divinité de la Danse accorde aux danseurs jugés dignes.${prompt}
  12105: Tu as traversé bien des terres pendant ton entraînement pour devenir danseur.${prompt}
  12106: 'Si tu retraces tes pas, la Divinité de la Danse pourrait apparaître devant toi et te remettre ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12107: 'Si cela arrive, ramène le ${item-singular: 0[2]} ici et montre-le moi.${prompt}'
  12108: 'Tu as trouvé ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, dis-tu ? Montre-moi ça.${prompt}'
  12109: Il n'y a pas de doute, c'est le vrai de vrai...${prompt}
  12110: Cela signifie que la Divinité de la Danse t'a jugé digne. Tu as gagné le droit de passer le test pour devenir Diva de la Troupe de Danse.${prompt}
  12111: C'est un titre donné aux danseurs bénis par la Divinité de la Danse. Le hic, c'est qu'il ne peut y avoir qu'un seul danseur de ce genre dans une troupe.${prompt}
  12112: Tu peux maintenant défier pour devenir la "diva" de la Troupe Brilioth.${prompt}
  12113: Qui va te tester ? Eh bien, ce sera bien sûr moi. Je n'aurais jamais imaginé que ce jour viendrait.${prompt}
  12114: Dans notre style martial, il n'y a pas de meilleur moyen de tester ses capacités que de se confronter face à face. Mais ne crois pas que je vais te ménager, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12115: Nous allons nous affronter à l'Arène de Qu'Bia. Tu es prêt ?${prompt}
  12116: |-

  12118: 'Bien. Quand tu arriveras, utilise ton ${item-singular: 0[2]} pour entrer dans l’arène.${prompt}'
  12119: 'Ton ${item-singular: 0[2]} est déchiré...${prompt}'
  12120: Ton destin est de chercher de plus grandes scènes jusqu'à ce qu'un jour tu deviennes la diva de tout Vana'diel.${prompt}
  12121: Promets-moi que tu reviendras danser avec nous, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12122: “Diva de la Troupe de Danse”… \nÇa sonne tellement comme un rêve... <Soupir>${prompt}
  12123: Oh salut, ${name-player}. Je me demandais où tu étais.${prompt}
  12124: Ça faisait un moment que je voulais avoir une discussion sincère avec toi. \nNe prends pas ça mal, mais... as-tu déjà envisagé de te faire confectionner un costume de danseur sur mesure ? Hmmm ?${prompt}
  12125: En tant que professionnels, nous devons porter une attention particulière à notre apparence, tu sais. \nEt il se trouve qu’il y a ce tailleur que je sais que tu adorerais !${prompt}
  12126: Il s'appelle Matthias. Les vêtements qu'il fabrique dans sa boutique à Bastok Markets sont tout simplement sublimes !${prompt}
  12127: 'Nous avons tous fait confectionner nos tenues par Matthias, même celle que ${item-singular: 0[2]} Laila porte. Elles sont juste magnifiques, non ?${prompt}'
  12128: Tu devrais absolument faire confectionner une tenue par Matthias aussi. Je te promets que tu ne le regretteras pas !${prompt}
  12129: Tu devrais absolument lui demander de te faire une tenue, aussi. Je te promets que tu ne le regretteras pas !${prompt}
  12130: |-
    Eh bien, eh bien, ne serais-tu pas ${choice-player-gender}[charmant(e)/magnifique] aujourd'hui ?

    Ne te méprends pas, les spectacles de danse qui se font de nos jours sont tous bien et bons.

    C'était l'une des troupes de danse les plus populaires à l'époque de la Guerre des Cristaux.${prompt}

    On en parle encore à San d'Oria aujourd'hui de sa performance solo à Lion Square il y a toutes ces années.${prompt}

    J'ai eu la chance de me procurer un billet pour ce spectacle.
    Je suis allé jusqu'à la taverne avant que ma femme ne réussisse à me retrouver et à me ramener à la maison.${prompt}
  12137: <Soupir>... C'est un regret qui restera avec moi jusqu'à la fin de mes jours.${prompt}
  12138: Même maintenant, je porte encore le billet avec moi. Juste comme un souvenir de la perfection que j'ai failli voir sur scène.${prompt}

  12361: Anyway, let's take a swift survey of the area, shall we?${prompt}

    I'm afraid it's just as I feared, kupo.
    This place needs some serious sprucing up!${prompt}
  12364: |-
    First, let's take care of this gaping gash in the ceiling.
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]} should do the trick, don't you think?${prompt}
  12365: |-
    An adventurer with your mining mastery should be able to find it in a flash, kupo!
    You wouldn't object to obtaining it for me, would you?${prompt}
  12366: |-
    While you're out, I'll take up my tools and get cracking.
    Happy hunting!${prompt}
  12367: Yes, Master?${prompt}
  12368: |-
    I'm all tied up making repairs at the moment.
    Do forgive me, kupo!${prompt}

    Incredible! What speed! What alacrity!
    I knew I could count on you, kupo!
    Now all it'll take is a tippity-tap here, a nudgety-nudge there, and...${prompt}
  12373: |-
    There! And sublimely done, if I do say so myself.
    But no rest for the weary moogle, kupo!
    To replace these rotting roofboards, we're going to need...
    Yes, ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} should do the trick.${prompt}

  12375: |-
    Phew! That'll do it.
    Truly, I'm shocked--stupefied, even--that our union-run Mog Houses are in a state of such disrepair!
    Something must be done...and soon, kupo!${prompt}
  12376: I know! I'll talk to Dom Kupeliaure!${prompt}
  12377: |-
    Knowing him, he'll fix these right up into lavish three-bedroom suites fit for King Kupofried himself!
    That's just the magnanimous moogle he is, kupo.${prompt}
  12378: |-
    Just leave it to me! I'll draft up an official renovation request.
    Why, we'll be living in the lap of luxury before you know it, kupo!${prompt}
  12379: As for the pressing repairs at hand...${prompt}
  12380: |-
    Yes, yes...
    Why, it looks as if we're just about--${prompt}

    Er--wait one minute. Yes, I...ah...almost forgot.
    One last piece of material to put on the critical coup-de-grace!
    A...${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, kupo.${prompt}
  12382: |-
    Don't worry. Preoccupied predators are leaving their hard-earned catches all over the place these days.
    Succulent slabs of meat are literally lying around waiting to be harvested by a keen-eyed adventurer like yourself!${prompt}
  12383: |-
    What's that, Master?
    Why, of course it's required for the repairs!
    Whatever are you insinuating, kupo!?${prompt}
  12384: |-
    I wouldn't dream of roasting it medium-rare, glazed with a delectable dragon-fruit-and-rolanberry sauce, and serving it on a romantic candlelit dinner date with my darling Kupiruru!
    That's the furthest thing from my innocent moogle mind!
    Please, Master! You're the only one who can save my romantic prospects--I mean, this dilapidated dwelling, kupo!${prompt}
  12385: |-
    ...and that should do it! Feast your eyes on this craftsmanship, Master!
    The precision! The perfection! Not a single bent nail! Not a single warped plank!${prompt}

    And I couldn't have done it without you, Master.

    How odd... He was always such an affable chap.
    Could the stress of dealing with disgruntled boarders be getting to him in his advanced age, kupo?${prompt}

    <Sigh>
    It seems we have a sticky situation on our hands...
    Whatever shall we do?${prompt}

    Hmm? What's this?
    A mysterious message mystically aglow atop the parchment?${prompt}

    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  12639: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  12640: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}

    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}

    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  12643: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  12644: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  12645: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  12646: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  12647: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  12648: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12649: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  12650: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  12651: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  12652: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  12653: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  12654: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  12655: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  12656: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  12657: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12658: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  12659: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  12660: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  12661: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  12662: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  12663: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  12664: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  12665: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  12666: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  12667: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  12668: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  12669: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  12670: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  12671: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  12672: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  12673: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  12674: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  12675: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  12676: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  12677: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  12678: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  12679: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  12680: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  12681: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  12682: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  12683: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12684: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  12685: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  12686: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  12687: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  12688: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  12689: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  12690: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  12691: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  12692: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  12693: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  12694: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  12695: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  12696: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12697: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  12698: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  12699: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  12700: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  12701: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  12702: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  12703: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  12704: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  12705: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  12706: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  12707: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  12708: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  12709: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  12710: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  12711: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  12712: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  12713: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  12714: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  12715: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  12716: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  12717: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  12718: |-
    A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.

  12725: |-
    Hmm...
    I'm afraid your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot house any more apertures.${prompt}

    ...Alas.
    It's a shame, but it appears your ${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be etched.${prompt}

  12737: |-
    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  12738: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  12739: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  12740: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  12741: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  12742: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  12743: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  12744: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  12745: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  12746: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  12747: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}

    Why don't we take our frustrations out on some nasty fiends, ${name-player}?${prompt}

    Aw, Luto, that's really too bad!
    Well, ${name-player}, why don't we cheer ourselves up with an adventure or two?${prompt}

  13067: |-
    Why, you! Don't play coy with me, ${name-player}.
    You know verrry well what I'm talking about!${prompt}
  13068: I have something for you, courtesy of that mangy moogle we've all grrrown to love.${prompt}
  13069: And how inexplicably convenient; I swear your comrrrade can sniff out adventure from fifty malms away.${prompt}
  13070: |-
    When you plod through the same motions three times, it's not hard to find a pattern to them.
    I suppose I'll be off to the Ru'Lude Gardens now, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13071: |-
    My ol' adventurer's intuition has never steered me wrong before, and it told me to come here at this very moment!
    Let's be off, ${name-player}! I can already hear an adventurous etude playing for us in Ru'Lude.${prompt}
  13072: |-
    There is no need for surprise; this will be our fourth undertaking, after all.
    So, shall we be on our way shortly, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13073: |-
    I simply analyzed the data available from our three previous exploits and concluded that ${name-player} would arrive around this time.
    Let us make haste for the gardens before the Mooglehood feels slighted by our tardiness.${prompt}
  13074: |-
    We've done this more times than I can count, Luto! Of course I know when and where my mentor will show up!
    Are you ready, ${name-player}? I'm ready! Ru'Lude ho!${prompt}
  13075: |-
    “The fourth time's the charm,” I always say. I must admit, though, I am a bit surprised as well.
    At any rate, will you be ready to depart soon, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13076: |-
    I may very well know ${name-player} better than ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] knows ${choice-player-gender}[himself/herself] after our various outings together, so ascertaining ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] location was no trouble at all.
    Anyway, I am ready whenever you are, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13077: |-
    I had an inkling that today would be the day, and lo and behold, it is! I'm so lucky!
    Or maybe it's because ${name-player} and I have already journeyed together so often?${prompt}
  13078: |-
    Such acumen may very well be thanks to the bonds we have forged together in battle, Luto.
    ${name-player}, I am at your service. Might I suggest we first make our way to the Ru'Lude Gardens?${prompt}
  13079: |-
    Maybe doing all these trials in tandewhatsit has bestowed us with some magical connective powers?
    I don't know why, but I just had a feeling that ${name-player} would be here today. Gee, I'm so glad I listened to that hunch!${prompt}
  13080: |-
    This ability--if it can even be called that--is merely the byproduct of our shared experiences.
    ${name-player}, I shall expend my utmost effort in this new trial. I trust you will do the same as well.${prompt}
  13081: |-
    This will be our fourth trial in tandem. I did not get this far by ignoring ${name-player}'s behavior.
    Whew, am I ever itching to whip me some upstart beastmen hides.

    Keep your mind on the trial at hand, not my stupid plight.${prompt}
  13091: |-
    To tell the trrruth, I wanted to put your new skills to good use. Sadly, this dumb world isn't so forrrgiving.
    All we need is for one lousy job to come our way!${prompt}
  13092: |-
    It figures...
    It's always the ill winds and never the gentle breezes that blow our way.${prompt}
  13093: |-
    This simply isn't fair!
    I cannot abide the fact that my failures are utterly ruining you, Luto!${prompt}
  13094: |-
    You do not deserve this, Luto.
    My lack of composure has brought this upon us both...${prompt}
  13095: |-
    I cannot adequately express the depth of my remorse.
    Had I not failed time and time again, then maybe...${prompt}
  13096: |-
    I'm very very very sorry I failed you, Luto!
    I'll make it up to you! I promise!${prompt}
  13097: |-
    My sincerest apologies, Luto.
    I never once considered the bind in which my failures would entrap you...${prompt}
  13098: |-
    How unbecoming of me.
    I am supposed to help contribute to your business, yet I cannot even do that...${prompt}
  13099: |-
    I feel so immensely terrible, Luto!
    Never in my wildest dreams did I mean to inflict such misery upon you!${prompt}
  13100: |-
    I cannot help but feel responsible for this.
    You can place all the blame on me and my shortcomings as an adventurer.${prompt}
  13101: |-
    I feel sorrier than a salted sea slug, Luto!
    What can I do to make things better!? I'll do everything within my power to help you!${prompt}
  13102: |-
    I alone should bear this burden--not you, Luto.
    You have been so kind to me, despite my myriad missteps.${prompt}
  13103: |-
    I'm sorry, Luto.
    I should not have failed you so.${prompt}
  13104: Cut the histrrrionics! Are you an adventurer or some mewling kitten!?${prompt}
  13105: Keep your chin up and concentrate on your trrrial. I don't want to get your fur all in knots before you even start, so let's just forget I said anything, okay?${prompt}
  13106: Jeuno's a big place, teeming with people facing all sorts of prrroblems. It should take only two swishes of a tail before one of them brings us some work!${prompt}
  13107: |-
    And when they do, I'll make sure to tuck it away until you're done training.
    Then you can clear it in a heartbeat and show the world just how much your skills have imprrroved!${prompt}
  13108: |-
    After that, word of your magnificent feat will spread throughout the town and offers will come pouring in!

  13114: Luto, you...you're like the elder sister I never had! Thank you so much!${prompt}

  13122: |-
    Whew, that's one obstacle down. You're on your own from here on out, but you know the prrroverb: when Altana gives you Azouph greens, charm a chocobo.♪
    Anyway, I wish you the best of luck!${prompt}
  13123: |-
    Oh ho. I see you're still both in one piece. Congratulations then on your trrriumph.
    How do you feel? Have you noticed any changes since your departure?${prompt}
  13124: |-
    As tedious as these trials are, I think I'm ready for another. Why, this is the strongest I've felt since I kicked that little...
    No, I'd best not say any more.${prompt}
  13125: Now I'm light as a cloud and tough as a tree! My hands can hit what even my eyes don't see!${prompt}
  13126: I'm not half bad. I wager I could go one-on-one with the Shadow Lord and barely even break a sweat.${prompt}
  13127: I feel quite empowered, thank you. All my senses seem heightened to the point where, for a fleeting moment, I almost questioned my mortality.${prompt}
  13128: What can I say? I'm ready to sink my teeth deep into the next job and tear off a chunk of absolute victory!${prompt}
  13129: |-
    I feel good enough to ask you out to dinner with me next week.
    Stay that thought! I'm not sure you're ready for me yet, my dear.${prompt}
  13130: This is a wonderful feeling. I am quite sure that were I to gaze into a mirror, all my senses as well as my face would be given point.${prompt}
  13131: I've never felt anything like this! I could take on all the evil in Vana'diel and emerge unscathed, to say nothing of your next task for me!${prompt}
  13132: This is a splendid feeling indeed. A simple wave of my hand seems sufficient to accomplish even the most arduous of tasks.${prompt}
  13133: |-
    This feeling is the best! It's like I huffed and puffed and blew down a wall that was blocking me!
    Now, what would you call that? A boundary bust, maybe?${prompt}
  13134: What a spectacular sensation. I can feel an unbelievable power welling up from the very depths of my being, surging through my limbs...${prompt}
  13135: I feel like I could claim all the world with a swift stroke of martial justice that's been sharpened upon my newly heightened senses.${prompt}
  13136: It's good to see you're enjoying your powerrrs.${prompt}
  13137: |-
    And while I'd like to rrreward your vim with an equally vigorous assignment, I don't have any right now.
    As I'm out of other ideas, why not continue training with ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13138: I suppose if there's nothing better to do...${prompt}
  13139: You won't be sorry, Luto. I promise to be so valiant that you'll hear minstrels singing my praises before I even return!${prompt}
  13140: If that's how it is, that's how it is. I have no qualms with more training.${prompt}
  13141: As long as you suggest such a course of action, Luto, I shall heed your sage advice.${prompt}
  13142: |-
    You're abso-truly-complelutely fine with me training some more!?
    You're the greatest, Luto!${prompt}
  13143: How do you always know exactly what to say to me, Luto? A purrrfect response, if I do say so myself.${prompt}
  13144: That would be simply divine! What a wonderful idea, Luto.${prompt}
  13145: |-
    Really!? Can I!?
    Then I'm going slay so many monsters that I'll forget why I'm slaying them in the first place!${prompt}
  13146: You are more than kind, Luto, and I shall avail myself of your generous offer.${prompt}
  13147: |-
    They say faith makes you stronger, and I have crates of faith in both you and ${name-player}!
    A little more training and I should be almost invincible!${prompt}
  13148: I shan't question your acumen, Luto. If that is what you suggest, I shall devote myself to training as thoroughly as possible.${prompt}
  13149: |-
    Is that your consent I hear?
    Then ${name-player} and I shall form an army of two, leaving nothing but a wake of utter destruction in our path.${prompt}
  13150: Don't pull any punches, either. I think it'd be the cat's meow if you come back even strrronger.${prompt}
  13151: The same goes for you, ${name-player}. You wouldn't want the disciple to become the masterrr, would you?♪${prompt}
  13152: The faster we depart, the faster we can finish this errand. Therefore, I'll be taking my leave now.${prompt}
  13153: I'll forge the way for us, ${name-player}! Just make sure you don't fall too far behind!${prompt}
  13154: I'll take the lead on this one and let you bring up the rear, ${name-player}. Rendezvous with me when you're able.${prompt}
  13155: |-
    I beg your leave.
    I apologize for my early departure, ${name-player}, but I shan't be too far ahead.${prompt}
  13156: I'm going to run on ahead, ${name-player}. Catch up with me if you can!${prompt}
  13157: |-
    Well, ${name-player}, I'm going on ahead. Just call my name if you find yourself in trouble.
    ...And here's looking at you, Luto. You're welcome to join us anytime.${prompt}
  13158: Well, I'm off. Remember, ${name-player}, no dilly-dallying. Finish what you have to do, then hurry right along.${prompt}
  13159: |-
    I can barely contain myself. I mean I can't contain myself at all!
    You better not linger long, ${name-player}, or there won't be any monsters left for you to practice on!${prompt}
  13160: |-
    And this is where I take my leave.
    Should you require my presence, ${name-player}, simply say the word and it shall take me mere moments to appear at your side.${prompt}
  13161: |-
    I'm going to leave now so I can start training right away.
    You're going to be so proud of me, ${name-player}. I just know it!${prompt}
  13162: |-
    Please excuse me, I must be going now.
    If you would be so kind as to let me know when you leave, ${name-player}, I would be extremely appreciative.${prompt}
  13163: "Good-bye, Luto. \nAnd ${name-player}, if you don't make haste after your conversation's finished, the consequences will be...how should I say...excruciating?\nBwahaha!${prompt}"
  13164: Hmmm. I should prrrobably get this business back up and running soon.${prompt}
  13165: I realize that capable adventurers like you and your friend won't stay satisfied with trrraining missions forever, now, will you?${prompt}
  13166: Maybe my old scrrratching post will help me come up with some good ideas to get back on track.${prompt}
  13167: Anyway, get out there and rrraise hell, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13168: "I knew you'd be back, ${name-player}. \nYou seem to sense exactly when I'm in the mood for your special serrrvices.${prompt}"
  13169: |-
    Oh, you. Stop prrretending to be such a kitten.
    We both know how quickly you get down to business.${prompt}
  13170: |-

  13180: |-
    Your whiskers really told you that, Luto? Because I came here after my adventurer's sense began tingling!
    We're so alike that we should start a business together! One where I get to do real jobs and not just train all the time!${prompt}
  13181: I assume this is just the usual training excursion? Would you be kind enough to remind me what sort of business we're running, again?${prompt}
  13182: |-
    Your mental acuity is most laudable, Luto. I expected nothing less from my employer.
    I shall expend my utmost effort in hopes this training will lead to more steady work.${prompt}
  13183: Awww, another trial in tandem? Just how many of these things are there!?${prompt}
  13184: A new training mission, eh? Well, I'm certainly not one to pass up a chance at impressing the ladies...especially after how I wowed the crowd last time.${prompt}
  13185: Thank you for thinking of me and ${name-player}, Luto. It's just such a shame these trials never lead to actual work...${prompt}
  13186: Yes! Another chance for me to kick some serious monster tuchus! Still, when I think of how we haven't gotten any work in forever...I...I...waaahhh!${prompt}
  13187: |-
    It's time once again for a trial in tandem, is it?
    Of course, I'm completely fine with undertaking this task so crucial to my own development, but--if I may--it does seem a tad suspicious that we never actually receive any job offers.${prompt}
  13188: You mean we're going off on another tangemawhatsit? Then I have to dig down deep and find my inner strength so we can bop those baddies and get some real work!${prompt}

    Heh heh heh. You may think this is just another trial in tandem, but you'd be wrrrong.

    May this endeavor prove fruitful for us both, ${name-player}.${prompt}

  13204: |-
    I'm elated to hear we finally have an official assignment.

    Just the sight of ${name-player} and me was so imposing that they cowered and ran away without a fight!

  13219: "Pffft. I could've gotten a wagonful of those things without a problem. \nI don't know if I could even call what we just did “work.”${prompt}"

    Don't think you can coddle me just 'cause I called you my big sister once!${prompt}

    That was a nice bit of exercise. My muscles are rippling even more than when we set out.

  13223: Thank you for asking, Luto! Well, knowing I contributed to society this time has given me an even more powerful sense of accomplishment! Without a doubt, I'll be sleeping soundly tonight.${prompt}

    I'm so worked up I can't even describe how I feel! I was all like, “Boom,” “Hya,” “Shaaa,” the whole time!
    I haven't felt like this in sooo long!${prompt}

  13226: It's like I doubled my treasure, doubled my fun, and doubled my power with...ummm, how's that go again? ${prompt}

    Luto, don't say that in front of me! It's disgusting!

  13267: |-
    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!

    If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!
    No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
    Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}
  13270: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt}
  13271: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt}

  13312: It looks like you can't carry any more. Try emptying some articles out and return when you have the room.${prompt}
  13313: |-
    Hahaha, you look like you've just been thrown from a chocobo!
    No need to be scared. I'll explain the process as best I can, but feel free to ask if I've missed something.${prompt}
  13314: |-
    Let's see if I can do this. First, form a party of one to six people.
    Next, trade your grimoire to the Burrow Researcher in charge of the burrows you're investigating.${prompt}
  13315: If the need arises, I can always transport you there.${prompt}
  13316: |-
    Alright, here goes nothing. First, form a party of one to six people.
    Next, trade your grimoire to me.${prompt}
  13317: |-
    ${choice: 0}[You'll receive/I'll give you/I'll give you] ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} and ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} once you hand it over.
    After that's done, you're ready to go spelunking...unless you're the party leader.${prompt}
  13318: 'Then you''ll have to talk to ${choice: 0}[the Burrow Researcher/me/me] again to decide which expedition to undertake.${prompt}'
  13319: I must warn you, though, that some expeditions require everyone to make a unanimous decision.${prompt}
  13320: Once your party's expedition has been chosen, it's time to go spelunking.${prompt}
  13321: |-
    Have your party leader talk to the Meeble guarding the burrow entrance.
    He'll escort you to the right research site.${prompt}
  13322: 'After you''ve finished an expedition, use ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to return aboveground and report to ${choice: 0}[the Burrow Researcher in charge or me/me/me] to get your grimoire back.${prompt}'
  13323: |-
    Now for a word about grimoires.
    They impart various benefits depending on what expeditions you've completed.${prompt}
  13324: It's dangerous down there, so be sure to make use of your grimoire.${prompt}
  13325: |-
    Finally, while there are many types of grimoires, they all share the same attributes.
    Feel free to change them out depending on your companions and the research assignment at hand.${prompt}
  13326: You must be the explorer my compatriot in Jeuno was talking about. What brings you here?${prompt}
  13327: "Well, well, look who it is. \nWhat do you need this time?${prompt}"
  13328: Finally! I've been waiting for you this whole time.${prompt}
  13329: We thought we had a bead on the Meebles' habitat, but it turns out we were dead wrong. There's another set of caverns in the vicinity of Batallia Downs!${prompt}
  13330: I can't understand how it remained buried for so long. Reports abound that the Moblins have expanded their base of operations and are employing Meebles for “nefarious deeds” once again.${prompt}
  13331: |-
    Now it's up to us, the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee, to unearth heaping amounts of knowledge for our glorious archives!
    Oh, and maybe to save the day, too.${prompt}
  13332: How, you ask? By collecting as much information as possible through new expeditions and finally getting to the bottom of this Moblin nuisance! We're always in need of proven researchers like yourself, should you wish to join in the action.${prompt}
  13333: |-
    What do you want to do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Head to the burrows.
    Choose an expedition.
    Get my grimoire back.
    Examine grimoire records.

    Inscribe feats upon your grimoire.
    Purchase emblems of valiance.
    Purchase a grimoire.
    Ask for further information.

    Review expedition specifics.
    Nothing for the nonce.${prompt}
  13335: |-
    Any questions?
    ${selection-lines}
    No, not right now.
    How does this whole research thing work?
    I...descend into underground caves!?
    What are these grimoires about?
    How do I begin an expedition?
    What goes on after an expedition?
    What dastardly foes lurk down below?
    Any rhyme or reason to these burrows?
    What are research marks?
    Can you tell me about the Meebles?
    What is grimoire engraving?
    Could you tell me about wizened worms?
    Palimpsests? Huh?${prompt}
  13336: |-
    You adventurers can help us collect data by embarking on certain expeditions belowground.
    The goals and activities for each journey you undertake will vary, so this won't be just some routine experiment.${prompt}
  13337: |-
    Although these subterranean caverns may appear simplistic from the outside, their twisting corridors disorient even the Moblins.
    Be careful.${prompt}
  13338: Of course, you'll have to prove your problem-solving skills during more forgiving operations before we let you tackle the truly scary stuff.${prompt}
  13339: |-
    Each expedition has a total of three goals for you to achieve. Complete just one goal or up to all three--the choice is yours.
    However, it should go without saying that the more goals you achieve, the better the reward.${prompt}
  13340: Lastly, the caves are no place for a solo adventurer to be traipsing about. We'll need you to travel in groups of three or more.${prompt}
  13341: |-
    Grimoires are types of magical books that ancient sorcerers brandished in battle long, long ago.
    Now that they've been unearthed again, we can use them for our benefit.${prompt}
  13342: |-
    What's the point of adapting them for use in the burrows? Why, to record the feats of explorers like you.
    Without them, it would be much harder to complete expeditions.${prompt}
  13343: |-
    Like I said, they're no picture books for children.
    They grant powerful effects for each expedition you finish.${prompt}
  13344: |-
    These boons pack a punch from the get-go, but completing expeditions also allows you to increase their potency twice!
    See, I'm sure these grimoires will prove useful in your studies of the Meebles' tunnels.${prompt}
  13345: Just to warn you beforehand, though, boons that affect Auto-Reraise and spoils cannot have their potency increased.${prompt}
  13346: |-
    Another catch is that only the effects of your leader's tome may be bestowed upon your party for normal expeditions.
    Hopefully that should be all the firepower you need, though.${prompt}
  13347: 'At the moment we only have ${number: 0} types of grimoires available, but we do plan on adding to that number eventually.${prompt}'
  13348: When you want to start a new expedition, just hand over your grimoire to the Burrow Researcher in charge of the burrows you're investigating.${prompt}
  13349: When you want to start a new expedition, just hand over your grimoire to me.${prompt}
  13350: 'Once you do that, ${choice: 0}[he''ll/I''ll/I''ll] dole out ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} and ${keyitem-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  13351: Those're the only supplies you'll need to start spelunking, but not so fast. You first have to decide what expedition you'll undertake.${prompt}
  13352: I'll help you make the necessary preparations for that based on your grimoire's records.${prompt}
  13353: |-
    It may seem like a lot to handle, but there's no need to start shaking in your boots.
    The Burrow Researcher in charge of the burrows you're investigating will help you make all the necessary preparations for that based on your grimoire's records.${prompt}
  13354: Only then can your party leader declare which journey you and your companions shall embark upon.${prompt}
  13355: 'It may smack of red tape, but you can only embark upon expedition #1 of each rank at first. At least you''re allowed to choose any expedition you''ve already proven your worth on.${prompt}'
  13356: Oh, and before I forget--for particularly grueling endeavors, everyone must sign up individually. The higher-ups like to think of it as “exonerating the committee from responsibility” or something I don't understand.${prompt}
  13357: 'After signing up, you''ll <cough> almost <cough> be ready to set off. The thing is...Meebles${choice: 0}[/, like that one over there,/, like that one over there,] roam the mouth of the burrows.${prompt}'
  13358: They don't trust anyone but the Moblins, so you'll have to dance like Moblins, prance like Moblins, and even romance like Moblins to gain access to the caves.${prompt}
  13359: |-
    ...Actually, you'll only need to stink like Moblins.
    I can give you ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} in exchange for a grimoire to make sure you smell the part.${prompt}
  13360: |-
    Don't worry, this method is tried and true.
    Meebles have very bad eyesight, so they mostly use their sense of smell to determine who's who.${prompt}
  13361: 'That sense of smell, however, is unrivaled. Even if you''re the only one who isn''t carrying ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}, they''ll sniff you out in an instant.${prompt}'
  13362: In fact, the only reason I haven't been turned into Galka gristle after standing here so long is because I keep one on me at all times.${prompt}
  13363: 'Once the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} does its thing and the Meebles take you down into their burrows, you''re free to experiment all you want.${prompt}'
  13364: '...Oh, but if you ever let enthusiasm get the best of you and forget your objectives, just use ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} to remind yourself.${prompt}'
  13365: There should be Speleological Handbooks secretly placed by our members all over the burrows.${prompt}
  13366: 'Holding your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} up to one should do the trick.${prompt}'
  13367: They can also serve as a way to record your underground activities.${prompt}
  13368: Once you finish an expedition, any information you record will have to be reflected in your grimoire.${prompt}
  13369: 'You''ll be given ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} after completing an expedition.${prompt}'
  13370: 'One puff on your ${item-singular: 1[2]} will allow your whole posse to climb back aboveground.${prompt}'
  13371: 'After making your escape, there''s only one thing left to do. Pay a visit to either the appropriate Burrow Researcher or me and show him your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  13372: 'After making your escape, you can show your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} to me.${prompt}'
  13373: '${choice: 0}[One of us will/I''ll/I''ll] reference the data you''ve collected and catalog it in your grimoire.${prompt}'
  13374: 'If you ever need to escape before completing an expedition, though, you can always use ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} instead.${prompt}'
  13375: |-
    Sadly, using ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} allows only its bearer to come up for air.
    Don't forget to show your ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} once you exit, even if you've bowed out midway through.${prompt}
  13376: |-
    There's nothing wrong with leaving in the middle of an expedition.
    You'll never be penalized for it, as we wouldn't want to weaken your adventuring spirit.${prompt}
  13377: 'Oh, and if you''ve been wondering how to get ahold of one of these ${item-plural: 3[2]}, you''ll get one from the Meeble guarding the entrance.${prompt}'
  13378: |-
    Some scary, twisted fiends roam the depths of these caverns...at least that's what our scouts who come back alive tell me.
    Of course, you'll likely come face-to-face with these nightmares, too.${prompt}
  13379: |-
    Why? Well, because you'll be tasked with culling one of them after completing the first four expeditions in a course.
    That's why.${prompt}
  13380: Whether you choose to accept such a dangerous mission is all up to you. However, keep this in mind.${prompt}
  13381: Accepting such an assignment means you'll never get back any grimoires we're holding for you.${prompt}
  13382: |-
    That's right. We'll need to archive all the precious data you've collected.
    Jeuno wasn't built in a day, and the same goes for our analysis of Meeble Burrows.${prompt}
  13383: Oh, I almost forgot. For extremely harrowing journeys such as these, everyone must sign up individually.${prompt}
  13384: This way we can be absolutely sure that everyone's prepared for the task at hand. We wouldn't want people without enough experience getting hurt down there.${prompt}
  13385: In return for your cooperation (or to make sure you truly survive), I'll bestow on your whole party the boons everyone has received up until now.${prompt}
  13386: This way you'll all be at your best to face the worst...in the name of science!${prompt}
  13387: This may seem obvious, but you can't just mull around all you want down there.${prompt}
  13388: 'Even if you can use ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to confuse the Meebles, they aren''t stupid enough to ignore you forever.${prompt}'
  13389: |-
    That's why we've set a ${number: 2}-minute limit per expedition (Earth time).
    We want to limit the number of casualties to as few as possible. Safety first, that's our motto.${prompt}
  13390: 'You should also know that we only give out one ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} every ${number: 1} ${choice: 3}[hour/minute]${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] (Earth time).${prompt}'
  13391: |-
    We do want you to be the best researcher you can be, though...
    How about we give you ${number: 3} ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} as a first-time offer? That way you can learn the ropes faster.${prompt}
  13392: It took us a while to realize, but the health of our explorers started failing after they'd carry multiple pouches for long periods of time.${prompt}
  13393: |-
    On the bright side, I'm bound by the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee code to keep up to ${number: 3} of them for you.
    Don't ask why the pouches don't affect me. And if you make a joke about my mother being a Moblin...${prompt}
  13394: |-
    I may be haler and heartier than the average Galka, but there's only so much of that stench I can take.
    If you need more pouches than I can carry, you'd better get yourself a pherobarrier box.${prompt}
  13395: Mind if I change to a fairer smelling subject now?${prompt}
  13396: 'In the event that the spirits haunting these caverns disallow one of your brethren entry, just return aboveground within three minutes without completing any objectives. You''ll be refunded your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} at no cost!${prompt}'
  13397: How nice of the committee, right? Now you don't have to burst a blood vessel if something happens during your descent.${prompt}
  13398: We may have many limits and regulations, but we're not heartless. We also dole out “research marks” to those who help us learn about Meeble Burrows.${prompt}
  13399: |-
    How do you get them? It's simple.
    The more you accomplish down there, the more marks you receive. You can also turn in marks for certain items and equipment.${prompt}
  13400: |-
    There's no need to be a forlorn funguar, either.
    The more fellow researchers on your expedition, the more marks you reap. “The more the merrier” has never rung more true!${prompt}
  13401: Our results suggest that Meebles are rather docile creatures, with little if any culture to speak of. They shouldn't pose much of a threat.${prompt}
  13402: They're easily manipulated, though, and the Moblins have taken advantage of that. They put the Meebles to work in caverns all over the realm.${prompt}
  13403: |-
    Meeble Burrows may be a quaint name, but what sort of fiends lurk amongst these dank caverns? Why are the Moblins making Meebles do their dirty work? And how large are these underground tunnels anyway?
    Maybe we haven't learned as much about the Meebles and their habitat as we thought...${prompt}
  13404: |-
    Wait...if you don't mind crawling through caves and dirtying your own hands for a good cause, how about joining in the exploration?
    We could use another pair of eyes down there. Just talk to me when you decide you'd like to help the scientific community.${prompt}
  13405: I'm sure I don't have to lecture you on receiving certain boons from your grimoire depending on the expeditions you've completed.${prompt}
  13406: But you do remember that boons from one grimoire can't be applied to another, right?${prompt}
  13407: Even worse, you build a relationship with your grimoire only to have it stolen away from you by some unfeeling bookworms right before you set off to slay the most fearsome of monsters!${prompt}
  13408: Well, even if you don't remember, those days are long gone! That's the wonderful thing about science--it progresses!${prompt}
  13409: We've identified unique arcane essences that are released with the completion of some goals and imbue the ink of our pens as we record your exploits.${prompt}
  13410: |-
    Using these essences, we can reconstruct the boons you've received from your grimoire records.
    Let me explain.${prompt}
  13411: 'If you had completed Adjunct Expedition #1, we could inscribe the boons from that expedition onto a blank grimoire.${prompt}'
  13412: Of course the boon would be the same as the one granted from completing that expedition...except for the fact that we can only inscribe level one boons into grimoires. Sorry, but the process is not yet perfect.${prompt}
  13413: |-
    Want to know what else isn't perfect? These inscriptions aren't free.
    It's sad, but grimoires and pheromone sacks don't sprout from the ground, you know!${prompt}
  13414: Meebles use their long sniffers to snuff up odds and ends from the burrow floor.${prompt}
  13415: According to our latest scouting report, they dredged up some things called... Give me a minute here...${prompt}
  13416: |-
    Palimpsests?
    I may not have the biggest brain this side of the Sea of Shu'Meyo, but I do know that these papers are some powerful stuff.${prompt}
  13417: The MBEC now also gives away wizened worms to adventurers who complete objectives.${prompt}
  13418: |-
    Meebles love their wizened worms, and how.
    Quite a non sequitur I pulled on you, right?${prompt}
  13419: |-
    Except it's not!
    Give the Meebles that guard the burrow entrances some of those water-starved wrigglers and they'll give you stuff in return...possibly even some parades...sorry, palisades...uh, palimpsests.${prompt}
  13420: |-
    Ridiculous name, I know. I can barely say it.
    These palimpsests are types of magical paper that temporarily aid everyone in your troop.${prompt}
  13421: All you need to do is trade it to the grimoire inside the caverns and you're good to go.${prompt}
  13422: I haven't been able to use it myself yet, so this might not be true. Still, a friend of a friend told me that while each piece of parchment has three possible effects, you can only choose one!${prompt}
  13423: Don't worry, he assures me that you can choose your desired effect through the wonders of that grimoire down there.${prompt}
  13424: If you want the beat-'em-up power of all three effects, though, you'll need to gather three pieces of parchment.${prompt}
  13425: |-

  13917: Of course, I need not tell you that for every one you strike down two more will doubtless take its place. I can think of no task more Sisyphean.${prompt}
  13918: Were it up to me, I would see the entire place set ablaze.${prompt}
  13919: I must admit that my mental health has taken a turn for the better knowing I can count on you to handle this issue.${prompt}
  13920: I must remain resolute, for it will not be much longer before my plans come to full fruition.${prompt}
  13921: But I am vexed that my comrades--my lord's right-hand troops--have been lax in their reporting of late.${prompt}
  13922: Doubtless they have their hands full. May the will of my lord be done.${prompt}
  13923: Goddesspeed, hero.${prompt}
  13924: Why won't the dead just stay dead? This goes against all our calculations.${prompt}
  13925: Perhaps they fear my lord's wrath and deemed their chances best on this side of the veil.${prompt}
  13926: Ah, my erstwhile friend! You couldn't have arrived at a more fortuitous time.${prompt}
  13927: At risk of sounding like a broken orchestrion, I confess that I require your assistance once more.${prompt}
  13928: I had been under the impression that the dead were set on returning here, to the world of the living--but it appears I was mistaken.${prompt}
  13929: What their true aim is remains yet a mystery, but one thing is certain--their leader possesses an immense power that defies expectations. Their plans must not be allowed to succeed.${prompt}
  13930: I say this not to diminish the vast capabilities of my master, but to demonstrate to you the commitment of my colleagues and I to ensuring that their machinations bear no fruit.${prompt}
  13931: Yet as the field of battle expands, our forces find themselves stretched increasingly thin. Even my master is vexed at where best to concentrate our efforts.${prompt}
  13932: And so my master created--employed--new soldiers to aid in the efforts. Prompt though their reports were, I found the content thereof to be impudent at best.${prompt}
  13933: “Stop yapping and clean up the stragglers. Those are your orders, and you'd best follow them.”${prompt}
  13934: The audacity! Whether they are right or not is immaterial--their tone is completely unaccpetable.${prompt}
  13935: Ugh. To think they get to me so easily...${prompt}
  13936: The will of my master is paramount. If we are to clean up the “stragglers,” then so be it.${prompt}
  13937: I will fill my charge without fail.${prompt}
  13938: I have taken the liberty of preparing a list of your next targets.${prompt}
  13939: Though information on previous marks was collected by my underlings, this time I have taken it upon myself to collate the necessary materials.${prompt}
  13940: Fear not. It is as accurate as the previous entries. I take my job quite seriously.${prompt}
  13941: It remains to be seen why our foes are mustering their forces here in Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13942: Ah, but you fancy yourself a defender of Vana'diel, do you not? How quaint.${prompt}
  13943: I wish you the best of luck.${prompt}
  13944: What is this? You wish to know if I'm familiar with a black-clad Goblin?${prompt}
  13945: Yes, I have had the displeasure. A more uncouth specimen I have never come across.${prompt}
  13946: But if you're going to wallow in the mud like a pig, then it was only appropriate that I gave them an appropriate porcine companion...so I introduced them to Shami.${prompt}
  13947: Pleasure to see you, ${name-player}. How are those two pig-headed buffoons doing?${prompt}
  13948: “What buffoons?” Why, Shami and Shemo, of course.${prompt}
  13949: I sent them that accursed Goblin and their accompanying retinue. Filth loves its own kind.${prompt}
  13950: Hahaha... Tell me how that turned out?${prompt}
  13951: Wh-what? Not only were the Goblin team not there, but then Duke Alloces...?${prompt}
  13952: But if the gate is closed, then it stands to reason that Duke Alloces shouldn't even be here!${prompt}
  13953: Ugh. This is why you can never trust anything to a low-level demon.${prompt}
  13954: |-
    But setting that small matter aside...
    You are after more information on the World Eater Egg, are you not?${prompt}
  13955: You must wonder what this means for the baneful dead.${prompt}
  13956: Worry not. I have prepared a list of more targets for you.${prompt}
  13957: |-
    Haha...
    Surely each one you banish brings a little bit more peace back to Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13958: Perhaps you have already surmised my true identity, but it is too late for you to turn back now.${prompt}
  13959: After all, the proverbial contract has already been signed.${prompt}
  13960: Hoho...a deal with the devil is not so easily overturned...at least not without paying the ultimate price.${prompt}
  13961: And with what you now know about some of the world's ugly truths, well...${prompt}
  13962: And that lovely retinue who depends on you oh-so-much will surely come through for you in the end.${prompt}
  13963: And of course, my lord Odin is depending on you as well.${prompt}
  13964: And I'm sure none of us want these targets to be in cahoots with Garazu-Horeizu, correct?${prompt}
  13965: Betrayal will be deemed a failure to fulfill the obligations of your contract. Surely I need not say more.${prompt}
  13966: So keep doing what you do best, and there will be no problems.${prompt}
  13967: Ah, and one last thing. If you try to flee, or tell anyone who we really are, it will not end well for you.${prompt}
  13968: This, too, would be an egregious violation of the terms of our little “agreement.”${prompt}
  13969: You see, ${name-player}, we have eyes and ears in every corner of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13970: And we are always watching...listening...${prompt}
  13971: Ah, ${name-player}. Somehow, I knew you would come.${prompt}
  13972: The sealing of the gate has been quite the catalyst. Wouldn't you agree?${prompt}
  13973: My understanding is that you are working together with Skokkr to reforge the Prime Weapons, are you not?${prompt}
  13974: My understanding is that you have worked together with Skokkr and succeeded in reforging a Prime Weapon, have you not?${prompt}
  13975: I wish you all the best in your journey to vanquish Chaos. After all, the Prime Weapons are the keys.${prompt}
  13976: Your Prime Weapon holds the key to besting Chaos, as you doubtless already know.${prompt}
  13977: 'But I would advise you one thing: the Prime Weapons belong to my master, and my master alone.${prompt}'
  13978: And when they return to him, I have no doubt that they will make their way into my hands...as my just reward for all I have accomplished.${prompt}
  13979: Oh, yes. The time for me to wield the Prime Weapons is close at hand.${prompt}
  13980: In fact, this puts me in the mood for a rousing tale. A secondhand tale, so I leave the analysis of its veracity to you.${prompt}
  13981: 5000 years ago, the Prime Weapons were made manifest after an eternity of trial and error.${prompt}
  13982: Those in charge searched endlessly for a way to figure out how to stop Chaos from devouring the astral plane.${prompt}
  13983: Of course, that was eons ago, so the exact time frame isn't clear, but I am led to believe that over one hundred years of effort were poured into this endeavor.${prompt}
  13984: It started with research into souls that hungered for more. A contract between them was established.${prompt}
  13985: But those initial results were...disappointing. More pure souls were required.${prompt}
  13986: I need not spell out for you what that implied.${prompt}
  13987: Many souls were snuffed out on the altar of progress, irrevocably removed from the cycle of life and death.${prompt}
  13988: And that is how those involved eventually arrived at the idea of imbuing souls into implements of power.${prompt}
  13989: If those souls are angered or cry out for vengeance, well...I'm sure that manifests itself in the potency of the armament.${prompt}
  13990: Perhaps that is why the Prime Weapons gleam with that beautiful obsidian light.${prompt}
  13991: Why, it is positively inspiring! Surely you wish to brandish them in battle even more than before.${prompt}
  13992: Ah, but we have time for one more tale. You know of the relic weapons, correct?${prompt}
  13993: My master conceived them during Ragnarok, and they contain the souls of the enlightened races.${prompt}
  13994: My master chose only the strongest from among those who proffered themselves up in his service.${prompt}
  13995: They cried out for succor. Who were we to deny them?${prompt}
  13996: Why, we were even able to help them defend their kingdoms, although perhaps in a different way than they had envisioned.${prompt}
  13997: Not that those nations exist anymore, mind you.${prompt}
  13998: That is enough stories for one day.${prompt}
  13999: I trust you found it a pleasant enough diversion, but now I bid you return to the task at hand.${prompt}
  14000: My success is linked to your success, after all. And I have new targets for you to hunt.${prompt}
  14001: Yes...I can feel it. The Prime Weapons will soon be mine to wield...${prompt}
  14002: '${color-alt: 15}Elijah smiles at you.'
  14003: '${color-alt: 15}Elijah begins laughing boisterously!'
  14004: ${name-player}. I must confess, I thought you had forgotten about me.${prompt}
  14005: We are at our watershed moment. I promise to be brief.${prompt}
  14006: As you are eminently aware, Garazu-Horeizu is on the move.${prompt}
  14007: Of course, we have no choice but to answer in kind.${prompt}
  14008: Yet moving too hastily has caused the downfall of many, so I would ask for your aid once more.${prompt}
  14009: The first issue is dealing with the defectors amongst the beastmen who have joined forces with Chaos.${prompt}
  14010: Unfortunately, their contingent is present not only in the Middle Lands, but Aht Urhgan and the Far East as well.${prompt}
  14011: With the enemy spread out across the world, I have had to dispatch some of my most loyal retainers to the far reaches of the globe.${prompt}
  14012: While they are dealing with the threat above, you will deal with Garazu-Horeizu at the gate between this world and the next.${prompt}
  14013: Of course, this will allow the gate to be opened.${prompt}
  14014: I will take up the rear guard, so you have not to fear.${prompt}
  14015: Ah, but perhaps you are concerned that my protection alone may prove insufficient.${prompt}
  14016: |-
    Are you concerned?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course!
    Of course not!${prompt}
  14017: Then we shall continue along the same path we have traveled to date.${prompt}
  14018: Oho. I may not have a Prime Weapon, but I promise that my skills are more than sufficient.${prompt}
  14019: Then we have our tasks. Let us see them through.${prompt}
  14020: This is our watershed moment. We must defeat Garazu-Horeizu and his minions.${prompt}
  14021: Best of luck to us all.${prompt}
  14022: ${name-player}. It has been a spell, hasn't it?${prompt}
  14023: You did well in ridding us of Garazu-Horeizu and Chaos.${prompt}
  14024: I would venture to say that your performance exceeded my wildest expectations.${prompt}
  14025: So much so, in fact, that I find myself at a bit of a loss.${prompt}
  14026: The original plan involved my master having a bit more of a...pivotal role in the aftermath, so to speak.${prompt}
  14027: But you kept all the best parts for yourself.${prompt}
  14028: Still, he was quite pleased with how you presented yourself during the entire ordeal.${prompt}
  14029: And my efforts were rewarded in turn, as I have been permitted to remain in this world for a spell.${prompt}
  14030: A curse in disguise, if you will, for I had hoped to return to his side.${prompt}
  14031: Yet you deserve to know a little bit more...perhaps my true name. Consider it a gift.${prompt}
  14032: I am Markgraf Eligos, and I serve as one of Odin's elite.${prompt}
  14033: May our relationship remain as fruitful going forward as it has been to date.${prompt}
  14034: Yes, “going forward,” as I still have the usual tasks for you to fulfill.${prompt}
  14035: Though Garazu-Horeizu no longer poses a threat, his hypnosis magic has still not completely dissipated from the land.${prompt}
  14036: And given the details of our pact, that means you still have your end to hold up.${prompt}
  14037: The pact cannot be broken, but rest assured that you will continue to be rewarded.${prompt}
  14038: The terms should be familiar to you by now. Continue to serve.${prompt}
  14039: And just to reiterate--there is no way to escape your obligation.${prompt}
  14040: I wish you the best of luck...${prompt}
  14041: '...and trust you will continue to meet the terms of our deal.${prompt}'
  14042: Keep at it.${prompt}
  14043: Good day, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14044: It seems you have been quite busy cleaning up the riff-raff.${prompt}
  14045: The A.M.A.N. has reported to me that your data has come in quite handy--and that you have filled all the tasks I have required of you.${prompt}
  14046: What's this? You wish to discuss it further?${prompt}
  14047: Ah, you wish to receive additional rewards for vanquishing what threats remain. I see, I see.${prompt}
  14048: And you have been unsuccessful in your efforts to procure such rewards, no?${prompt}
  14049: For when you defeat them, they keep coming back?${prompt}
  14050: Forgive me for laughing, but you are aware that you are asking for rewards for killing that which is already dead.${prompt}
  14051: They are of a different world than ours, after all, and trapping them in this one is a fool's errand.${prompt}
  14052: But I do admire your gumption.${prompt}
  14053: I am not an unreasonable man. If you are able to best them again if and when they should appear in our plane, then who am I to deny you an extra prize?${prompt}
  14054: Then I shall prepare some more objectives for you to sink your teeth into. That strikes me as fair, wouldn't you agree?${prompt}
  14055: 'Let us set the rate: one additional reward for every three objectives completed.${prompt}'
  14056: After all, what adventurer does not love rewards, hmm? Just don't get yourself offed in the process.${prompt}
  14057: Oh, yes, and be aware that the additional reward can only be earned monthly (Earth time).${prompt}
  14058: Just keep doing what you're doing.${prompt}
  14059: Good day, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14060: Oh, worry not. Your achievements have not gone without notice.${prompt}
  14061: Here are your additional rewards.${prompt}
  14062: May our paths cross again soon.${prompt}
  14063: Good day, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14064: “Additional rewards?” Surely you do not think you have earned any.${prompt}
  14065: Remember that your contract with me must be carried out in full.${prompt}
  14066: Good day, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14067: You may consider your monthly duties filled. As always, your support is greatly appreciated.${prompt}
  14068: Hopefully our paths will cross again next month.${prompt}
  14069: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Rolandienne in Southern San d'Oria (G-10).
  14070: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Isakoth in Bastok Markets (E-11).
  14071: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Fhelm Jobeizat in Windurst Woods (J-10).
