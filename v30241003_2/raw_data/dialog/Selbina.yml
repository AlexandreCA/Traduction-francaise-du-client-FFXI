  6720: Oui... Pauvre garçon ! Elle doit être au fond de l'eau maintenant. Je le plains, mais il ne la reverra plus jamais.${prompt}
  6721: Ne te préoccupe pas de moi. J'ai beaucoup à penser, et... Hein ? Oh, tu as entendu parler de ma bague, c'est ça ?${prompt}

  6863: Prenons un exemple. Disons que tu es niveau 20 en tant que guerrier et niveau 10 en tant que mage blanc. Tu choisirais évidemment guerrier comme emploi principal et mage blanc comme soutien.${prompt}
  6864: Dans ce cas, tu combattras comme un guerrier de niveau 20 et un mage blanc de 10 niveaux. Tu réalises ainsi le potentiel maximum des deux emplois.${prompt}
  6865: En revanche, si tu choisissais mage blanc comme emploi principal et guerrier comme soutien, ça changerait tout !${prompt}
  6866: Puisque tu n'as que 10 niveaux en tant que mage blanc, ton potentiel de guerrier serait réduit à la moitié de ton emploi principal. Donc, 5 ! Pas très malin, hein ?${prompt}
  6867: De même, tu ne voudrais pas choisir un emploi de soutien que tu n'as jamais pratiqué. Si le niveau de ton emploi de soutien est inférieur à la moitié de celui de ton emploi principal, tes compétences non développées ne seraient d'aucune utilité. Souviens-t'en bien !${prompt}
  6868: Je te recommande de choisir un emploi de soutien qui compense les faiblesses de ton emploi principal ou qui renforce ses points forts.${prompt}

  6930: Quoi, encore toi ? Bon, je ne vais pas te sermonner. Très bien, je vais jeter un œil. Donne-moi un instant.${prompt}
  6931: Il s'est amélioré, c'est vrai. Mais il ne comprend toujours pas les bases de la cuisine. Cuisiner ne se résume pas à marchander les ingrédients !${prompt}
  6932: Tout a une base, pas seulement la cuisine. Faire quelque chose de bien en apparence est facile ; c'est ce qu'il y a dedans qui compte.${prompt}
  6933: Ce n'est qu'en comprenant les bases qu'on peut rendre l'intérieur bon. Les amateurs sont souvent trop pressés ; ils se concentrent trop sur l'apparence.${prompt}

  6940: Tu pourrais aussi utiliser des ingrédients coûteux, et même si tes ustensiles sont médiocres, ton plat aura toujours bon goût.${prompt}
  6941: La bonne nourriture ne vient pas d'épices sophistiquées ou de couverts luxueux. Ni d'une analyse méthodique.${prompt}
  6942: En vérité, rien n'est plus important que le désir de satisfaire les autres avec de bons plats, et de trouver des moyens pour y parvenir.${prompt}
  6943: Si seulement mon fils pouvait réaliser cela, il y aurait encore un peu d'espoir pour lui.${prompt}
  6944: Cuisiner est un art complexe, mais les bases sont aussi claires que le jour. Je suppose que c'est valable pour à peu près tout.${prompt}
  6945: N'oublie jamais de remercier chaque repas. De nombreuses mains travaillent dur pour nous apporter notre subsistance.${prompt}
  6946: Bonjour. Je suis Mathilde, et mon père dirige cette boutique de la guilde.${prompt}
  6947: Nous ne vendons que des produits qu'il choisit lui-même. Alors, repose-toi, tu sais que tu obtiens des marchandises de qualité à chaque achat !${prompt}
  6948: Eh bien, bonjour. Ma fille et moi tenons encore le fort. Ah, ce mari à moi est toujours dehors à surveiller ses précieux moutons.${prompt}
  6949: Ma fille Mathilde s'est mariée il y a environ cinq ans. Elle nous a donné un petit-fils, et c'est un si gentil petit garçon !${prompt}
  6950: Je dis toujours à mon mari combien nous sommes chanceux !${prompt}
  6951: Mais tu vois, Mathilde est adoptée. Tout le monde dit que nous nous entendons mieux que la plupart des vraies familles, pourtant.${prompt}
  6952: Mon mari l'a trouvée sur une route commerciale quand elle n'était qu'une enfant, et il l'a ramenée chez nous. Je n'arrive pas à croire que vingt ans aient pu passer si vite !${prompt}
  6953: Le problème, c'est qu'elle n'a aucun souvenir de son passé. Elle ne pouvait même pas se rappeler son nom. Elle ne semblait pas blessée, alors elle a dû traverser une épreuve terrible. Pauvre petite...${prompt}
  6954: Mon mari pense que sa famille a été attaquée par des monstres, et qu'elle en a été la seule survivante. Le monde entier était en guerre à l'époque, et de telles tragédies étaient courantes.${prompt}
  6955: Elle ne se souvient toujours de rien de cette époque. Rien, sauf le nom d'un certain garçon. Il devait être une personne très importante pour elle.${prompt}
  6956: Bonjour encore. Nous avons plein de belles choses aujourd'hui. Prends ton temps !${prompt}
  6957: Je suis à la maison !${prompt}
  6958: Salut, Aldo.${prompt}
  6959: Maman, regarde ! J'ai trouvé ça sur la plage. C'est pour toi !${prompt}
  6960: Quelle jolie coquille ! Merci.${prompt}
  6961: Ashtia m'attend. Je dois y aller !${prompt}
  6962: Prends soin de toi !${prompt}
  6963: Toujours !${prompt}
  6964: J'en trouverai une pour toi aussi, grand-mère !${prompt}
  6965: Merci, Aldo. Ce serait gentil.${prompt}
  6966: Il va et vient comme un cyclone, ce garçon !${prompt}
  6967: Mon petit trésor, ce Aldo. Où pourrait être mon autre précieux Aldo ? Il pourrait être quelque part...${prompt}
  6968: 'Non, il est quelque part. Il vit une vie heureuse quelque part. Regarde-nous : nous vivons si loin l’un de l’autre sous le même ciel.${prompt}'
  6969: Ravi de te voir. Une fois que tu atteins mon âge, tu réalises que tu dois travailler sinon tu ne te lèveras jamais du lit.${prompt}
  6970: Tu as rencontré Aldo, n'est-ce pas ? N'est-il pas un si gentil petit garçon ? Je dis toujours à mon mari combien nous sommes bénis d'avoir à la fois un enfant et un petit-fils !${prompt}
  6971: Tu veux quelque chose ? Je suis pêcheur ici depuis la nuit des temps ! Bien sûr, j'ai aussi une petite affaire à côté.${prompt}
  6972: Si tu veux apprendre la pêche, demande à Gabwaleid. Il n'en a pas l'air, mais il en sait beaucoup. C'est moi qui lui ai tout appris ! Haha !${prompt}
  6973: Que puis-je faire pour toi ? Je suis Gabwaleid. Un jour, je veux être un vrai pêcheur comme Zaldon.${prompt}
  6974: Il faut choisir le bon appât selon le poisson que tu veux attraper. Sinon, tout est perdu !${prompt}
  6975: Il faut aussi tenir compte de l'heure de la journée et de la météo. Essaie de pêcher au meilleur moment et sous le meilleur temps.${prompt}
  6976: Tu attraperas différents poissons selon où tu te trouves. Bien sûr, il y a une grande différence entre pêcher en rivière et en mer.${prompt}
  6977: Oh, et encore une chose... Ça n'arrive presque jamais, mais de temps en temps, quelque chose... d'inattendu pourrait mordre. Fais attention !${prompt}
  6978: Il n'y a rien de mieux que de pêcher depuis le bateau. Il y a tant de choses uniques à attraper. Le temps passe si vite !${prompt}
  6979: Il n'y a rien de mal avec les appâts, mais je préfère les leurres. On peut les réutiliser jusqu'à ce que la ligne casse ou que la canne se brise. Bien sûr, ils coûtent plus cher.${prompt}
  6980: Dis-moi, as-tu entendu ? Les pirates rôdent entre Selbina et Mhaura. Fais attention. On ne sait jamais quand ils frapperont la prochaine fois !${prompt}
  6981: Des Orcs au nord, des Tortues au sud... Avec l'océan maintenant infesté de corsaires, notre village est le seul refuge !${prompt}
  6982: Es-tu déjà allé à Jeuno ? On dit que nul ne peut remettre en question la valeur d'un homme qui a marché jusqu'à Jeuno.${prompt}
  6983: Nous travaillons sur les quais. Les navires de commerce ne pourraient pas naviguer sans nous, mais j'imagine que nous mourrions de faim sans eux, aussi.${prompt}
  6984: Garde un œil ouvert pour les pirates. On dit qu'ils frappent en utilisant des pouvoirs mystérieux. C'est la vérité, crois-le ou non.${prompt}
  6985: J'entends dire que beaucoup de Humes à Bastok nous méprisent, nous les Galka.${prompt}
  6986: Personne n'est comme ça ici à Selbina. Ici, la race n'est pas un problème. Ce qui compte, c'est un esprit ouvert.${prompt}
  6987: Notre ville est tout aussi éloignée des grandes nations. Tu peux aller à Bastok, tu peux aller à San d'Oria--toutes les routes sont aussi risquées.${prompt}
  6988: Mon mari est parti pêcher. Il y a beaucoup de bons poissons ici.${prompt}
  6989: On joue à cache-cache. Je me demande où sont les trois autres...${prompt}
  6990: Oh, tu m'as trouvé en premier ! Je savais que cet endroit serait une mauvaise cachette.${prompt}
  6991: Waouh, tu m'as fait peur ! S'il te plaît, ne leur dis pas que je suis ici !${prompt}
  6992: Je me cacherais plus loin, mais il y a un homme effrayant là-bas. J'ai tellement peur qu'ils me trouvent ici !${prompt}
  6993: Ha ! Il ne me trouvera jamais ici ! Oh, attends... Il est vraiment doué pour nous trouver...${prompt}
  6994: C'est la maison du maire. Notre maire est un homme bien. Entre et dis bonjour.${prompt}
  6995: Les Dunes de Valkurm sont le territoire de Selbina, mais notre milice est trop peu nombreuse pour le patrouiller. C'est triste, mais vous les aventuriers devez garder les sables en sécurité.${prompt}
  6996: Oh, toi encore. Merci pour tout ce que tu as fait pour nous. Nous avons besoin de toute l'aide que nous pouvons obtenir.${prompt}
  6997: Pas de rapports de problèmes récemment. Pour nous, pas de nouvelles, c'est une bonne nouvelle !${prompt}
  6998: Notre village est petit, mais beaucoup s'arrêtent ici pour se reposer sur la route entre Bastok et San d'Oria.${prompt}
  6999: Désolé, la station est réservée au personnel de la milice uniquement.${prompt}
  7000: Si tu pars à l'extérieur, rappelle-toi qu'il y a de la sécurité dans les nombres. Rassemble des gens de talents différents pour couvrir toutes les faiblesses.${prompt}
  7001: Si tu es là pour le bateau, les quais sont juste au bas des escaliers d'ici.${prompt}
  7002: Je suis Velema. Je garde les quais.${prompt}
  7003: Y a-t-il un problème ? Vois le maire si tu as des questions.${prompt}
  7004: Les visiteurs me demandent souvent comment trouver les mines de Palborough. Que pourraient-ils vouloir dans ses tunnels sombres et sinueux ?${prompt}
  7005: As-tu déjà visité le bureau du maire ? Cette Naillina en sait tellement sur tout !${prompt}
  7006: J'ai remarqué un homme vraiment suspect qui a visité la ville récemment. L'as-tu vu ?${prompt}
  7007: Isacio était chevalier il y a longtemps. Je me demande ce qui l'a amené ici...${prompt}
  7008: Zaldon a toutes sortes d'histoires à raconter. Mais il est tellement têtu que ta tête va te faire mal !${prompt}
  7009: Gabwaleid sait en fait beaucoup de choses sur la pêche. Il t'apprendra tout ce que tu dois savoir.${prompt}
  7010: Le cuisinier de l'auberge, Valgeir, prépare des plats fantastiques. J'aimerais avoir assez d'argent pour en essayer un !${prompt}
  7011: Le maire Abelard est plus un scientifique qu'un homme politique. Il s'intéresse à un genre de recherche.${prompt}
  7012: Vuntar est un travailleur sincère. Maintenant que j'y pense, il travaille ici depuis aussi longtemps que je me souvienne...${prompt}
  7013: Melyon est tellement fier de ses moutons, n'est-ce pas ? Il a trouvé des noms intéressants pour eux.${prompt}
  7014: Romeo cherche toujours de nouvelles façons de gagner de l'argent. Et je pense qu'il est plutôt doué pour ça aussi.${prompt}
  7015: Je m'appelle Manfried et je suis adjoint avec Flandiace. Velema est notre sergent, et tous les trois nous servons sous Thunder Hawk.${prompt}
  7016: Bonjour !${prompt}

  7663: Fish Ranking is a contest held periodically by the Fishermen's Guild. Participants compete based on a set of defined rules regarding the size and weight of a certain big fish.${prompt}
  7664: To participate, you must acquire the fish we specified for the contest and bring it here. We won't look over your shoulder to see if you're catching your fish or buying them. That's your personal decision.${prompt}
  7665: You can only have one fish entered for Fish Ranking at once. You can choose to overwrite your current entry with a new catch, but you won't be able to re-register your previous submission.${prompt}
  7666: We will announce the results after the submission period ends. The top ten entries will receive a modest award and prize money, as well as a new title.${prompt}
  7667: Fish are judged based on a set of predetermined rules.${prompt}
  7668: The rules are simple. All fish are inscribed with their size (Im) and weight (Pz). The contest may be judged based on either number, or even both values added together.${prompt}
  7669: Depending on the rules, the person who caught the fish with the lowest or the greatest value wins!${prompt}
  7670: Value is determined by the calculation of “points” and evaluated based on the contest rules. For example, when the rules designate the “smallest fish,” the person with the fewest points will win.${prompt}
  7671: During the submission period, I will inform everyone what criterion we are judging by, so just ask if you're curious!${prompt}
  7672: 'If you would like to submit an entry, please ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the fish specified for the contest to me, and I will give it a rough inspection.${prompt}'
  7673: |-
    The fish will be registered if I deem it is suitable for the contest.
    You may only have one fish registered at a time. Registering a second specimen will remove your previous submission from the entry database.${prompt}
  7674: After you pay the registration fee, I will return your fish to you. All that's left afterwards is to wait for the results.${prompt}
  7675: To ensure a fair contest, we will label your fish before returning it.${prompt}
  7676: This will not affect the fish other than disqualifying it from reentry in Fish Ranking. You can still cook the fish, sell it at auction, or use it for quests.${prompt}
  7677: After the submission period ends, the results will be announced. To view the ranking board, just speak to me.${prompt}
  7678: Anybody may view the ranking board. You'll especially want to check if you or a friend participated in the last contest. Perhaps one of you will be listed on the board, too!${prompt}
  7679: The top ten contestants will receive a modest award consisting of prize money from the Fishermen's Guild and a new title.${prompt}
  7680: 'In addition, participants in the top twenty will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} as a souvenir.${prompt}'
