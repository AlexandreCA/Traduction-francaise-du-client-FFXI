    Dans les montagnes de Gustaberg,
    au sud de Quon, se trouve la nation
    industrielle connue sous le nom de République de Bastok.${wait-animation: 5}
  7407: |-
    Comparée à San d’Oria, avec ses légendaires
    ordres de chevaliers, ou à Windurst, avec ses
    anciens instituts de magie, Bastok est encore
    une jeune nation.${wait-animation: 7}
  7408: |-
    Mais grâce à une technologie avancée et à des
    ressources souterraines quasi illimitées,
    Bastok a pu rivaliser en puissance avec les deux autres nations.${wait-animation: 7}
  7409: |-
    Les Humes, innovants et adaptables, composent
    plus de la moitié de la population de Bastok.${wait-animation: 5}
  7410: |-
    Avec leur talent pour l’industrie, l’économie
    et la politique, ils ont été la force motrice
    derrière la croissance rapide de Bastok. Même
    aujourd’hui, les Humes occupent des postes clés dans ces domaines.${wait-animation: 7}
  7411: |-
    Les Galka, une race d’humanoïdes imposants,
    représentent un tiers de la population de Bastok.
    Originaires de Zepwell, ils sont arrivés
    dans cette région il y a plus de six cents ans.${wait-animation: 7}
  7412: |-
    Sans leur force incomparable,
    les innombrables mines de minerai qui alimentent

  7440: '...Nous n’aventurons pas toujours ensemble...${prompt}'
  7441: |-
    ...C'est ça.
    Y a-t-il quelque chose avec lequel nous pouvons t'aider ?

  7442: |-
    Pour commencer, j'aimerais...
    ${selection-lines}
    Combattre des monstres !
    Faire des courses.
    Trouver un travail.${prompt}
  7443: |-
    Alors tu veux être à l'extérieur des murs de la ville.
    Dirige-toi vers le sud-ouest d'ici et tu trouveras la Porte Ouest.${prompt}
  7444: Toujours “vérifier” la force de ta cible avant de l'attaquer et assure-toi qu'elle ne va pas t'avaler tout entier.${prompt}
  7445: |-
    Tu es dans les Marchés de Bastok.
    Tu devrais y trouver tout ce dont tu as besoin dans ce quartier.${prompt}
  7446: |-
    Sur le Pont Kulatz près de la Porte Ouest, tu trouveras le magasin d'armes Les Griffes du Dragon, le magasin d'armures de Brunhilde, et le magasin de Mjoll.
    La boutique de magie de Sororo et l'entrée des Métallurgiques sont dans la section nord.${prompt}
  7447: |-
    Se fixer des objectifs, c'est bien.
    Quel genre de travail cherches-tu ?${prompt}

    Que veux-tu faire ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Servir Bastok.
    Aider les gens.
    Devenir riche, rapidement.${prompt}
  7449: |-
    Ah, un patriote ! Tu veux parler à un garde chargé d'assigner des missions.
    Tu devrais en trouver un à la Porte Ouest. C'est au sud-ouest d'ici.${prompt}
  7450: Hmm... Je ne pense pas connaître quelqu'un qui ait besoin d'aide en ce moment.${prompt}
  7451: |-
    Moi, je connais quelqu'un. Elle s'appelle Michea.
    C'est une Elvaan qui vit juste à côté de chez moi.
    Pourrais-tu lui parler et voir si tu peux l'aider ?${prompt}
  7452: |-
    Va au Pont Kulatz près de la Porte Ouest.
    Là, tu verras trois bâtiments avec des magasins.
    Michea vit au deuxième étage du bâtiment du milieu.${prompt}
  7453: Pourquoi ne l'aides-tu pas toi-même ?${prompt}
  7454: '...${prompt}'
  7455: |-
    D'accord, je ne demanderai pas.
    Eh bien, voilà.${prompt}
  7456: |-
    Alors tu devrais aller à Gold Street, où vivent les riches et célèbres de Bastok. Elle longe le canal à l'est d'ici.
    Tu ne devrais pas avoir de mal à trouver un travail bien payé là-bas.${prompt}
  7457: |-
    Bref...tiens, prends ce ${item-singular: 7[2]}.
    Donne-le à un garde nommé Reet, et elle te donnera un peu d'argent pour commencer.${prompt}
  7458: Tu peux la trouver...${prompt}
  7459: |-
    Ici.
    Ouvre la “Carte” depuis le menu principal à droite si tu veux la consulter à nouveau.${prompt}

  7464: |-
    Alors je n'ai rien à faire avec toi.
    Sors, je dis ! Sors !${prompt}
  7465: Permets-moi de me présenter. Je suis Horatius, le plus grand collectionneur de gemmes de tout Bastok.${prompt}

  7467: 'J’aimerais mettre la main sur quelque chose appelé ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  7468: |-
    Comme tu peux le deviner d'après le nom, le Dangruf Wadi est l'endroit où il faut chercher.
    De plus, la légende dit qu'il ne peut être trouvé que lors des journées ensoleillées.${prompt}
  7469: |-
    Si tu parviens à mettre la main sur ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}, apporte-la-moi.

    Beau travail, beau travail !
    Voici ta récompense !${prompt}

    Quelle pierre étrange et merveilleuse...
    Je pense que je veux encore plus de celles-ci !${prompt}
  7472: Mon mari dit qu'il est collectionneur, mais je dois dire qu'il n'a pas beaucoup de goût.${prompt}
  7473: Il ne sait tout simplement pas quoi faire de tout cet argent qu'il a gagné pendant la Guerre du Cristal en forgeant des canons pour la République.${prompt}
  7474: |-
    Eh bien, eh bien. Que avons-nous ici ? Un aventurier, dirais-je.
    Oui, vous avez ce regard enthousiaste sur votre visage.${prompt}
  7475: |-
    Eh bien, puisque vous êtes ici, autant faire un peu de travail pour moi.
    Un monstre a pris mon colis au messager qui le transportait.${prompt}
  7476: |-
    Le messager a dit qu'il a été attaqué près du phare dans le sud de Gustaberg.
    L'aventurier que j'ai envoyé avant a échoué à l'attraper, et la bête ne sort plus.${prompt}
  7477: |-
    Il doit y avoir un moyen de l'attirer dehors. J'aurais demandé à Dalzakk--il est très renseigné sur de telles affaires--mais il est parti en voyage, à l'aventure.
    <Soupir> Qu'est-ce qu'il en est de vous autres avec cette affaire d'« aventure » ?${prompt}
  7478: |-
    Si vous parvenez à le ramener, cependant, je vous donnerai une récompense.
    Je sais que c'est ce que vous voulez.${prompt}
  7479: Si vous cherchez Monsieur Dalzakk, il est parti en voyage pour un moment.${prompt}
  7480: |-
    Le monstre dans le phare ?
    Oui, en fait, j'ai entendu Monsieur Dalzakk en parler avant.
    Je pense que vous devez mettre ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} derrière le phare pour l'attirer.${prompt}
  7481: |-
    Il a dit que vous devez « échanger » avec des points sélectionnables sur le terrain pour utiliser ou placer des objets.
    Cela aide-t-il ?${prompt}
  7482: |-
    Bien, vous avez compris.
    Voici votre récompense.${prompt}
  7483: Bastok est une source de gemmes rares et précieuses... et je jure sur ma fierté de collectionneur, je les aurai toutes !${prompt}
  7484: |-
    Hmm ?
    Que voulez-vous de moi ? Sortez !
    Dehors !${prompt}
  7485: |-
    Si vous cherchez Mister Dalzakk, il est parti à l'aventure.
    Il me laisse rester ici et lire ses livres pendant qu'il est absent.${prompt}
  7486: Hm ? Qu'est-ce que je lis maintenant ? Ça s'appelle “Les Chroniques de Prien le Brave.” C'est la biographie d'un président célèbre qui a régné pendant la Guerre du Cristal.${prompt}
  7487: J'ai d'abord pris le livre à cause des gravures intéressantes sur sa reliure, mais après avoir lu quelques pages, j'ai ressenti une connexion plus profonde avec l'histoire.${prompt}
  7488: Je me demande si cela a quelque chose à voir avec la balle en bronze que j'ai trouvé en la serrant dans ma main lors de ma renaissance...${prompt}
  7489: |-
    Bienvenue, aventurier. Je m'appelle Nudara. J'étais autrefois le maître de cette belle guilde.
    Je passe maintenant de temps en temps pour donner des conseils aux jeunes adeptes, bien qu'ils n'aient souvent pas le temps d'écouter les réflexions d'un vieux orfèvre chevronné.${prompt}
  7490: Comme vous pouvez le voir, de nos jours, des métaux exotiques tels que le platine et l'orichalcum occupent les étagères de la guilde comme des mauvaises herbes dans un jardin.${prompt}
  7491: Cependant, quand j'étais encore jeune, la distribution de presque tous les métaux, du bronze à l'argent, était régulée par la République. C'était une lutte pour trouver suffisamment de ressources pour forger une simple bague.${prompt}
  7492: Ce sont des réglementations comme celles-là qui nous ont poussés à nous concentrer sur nos techniques. Cela a donné aux jeunes soldats une raison de dépenser un mois de salaire pour quelque chose de spécial à laisser à leurs proches avant de partir au front.${prompt}
  7493: Je chérirai toujours la pensée que mon talent a apporté une lueur de bonheur à une époque si remplie de chagrin.${prompt}
  7494: <Bâillement> Je suppose que je vais sauter le travail aujourd'hui aussi...${prompt}
  7495: |-
    Oups... vous avez entendu ça ?
    Je travaille aux Forges, vous voyez, mais mon travail là-bas est assez ennuyeux.
    Faire la même chose encore et encore, tous les jours de la semaine...
    Ça devient vraiment pesant après un moment, vous savez ?${prompt}
  7496: Prenez le Firewater Circle, par exemple. J'ai entendu dire que pendant la Guerre du Cristal, il y avait une immense tour juste là où se trouve la fontaine. Cela aurait été quelque chose à voir, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7497: <Soupir>... Pourquoi ne peut-il pas y avoir une nouvelle guerre ou quelque chose comme ça ? Alors, je pourrais quitter ce boulot sans avenir et m'enrôler dans la Légion Républicaine !${prompt}
  7498: Avec mon intelligence, je serais commandant en un rien de temps ! Il suffit de ne pas me demander d'aller au front... j'ai une chose à propos de la mort...${prompt}
  7499: |-
    Hungry Wolf vous a parlé de ${item-plural: 7[2]} ?
    Oui, c'est un vrai gourmet, celui-là. Tout comme moi.${prompt}
  7500: C'est vraiment difficile à faire, et cela prend des années de pratique pour le perfectionner et tout ça, mais si vous obtenez cet ingrédient spécial, même vous pouvez en faire un. Vous voulez savoir ce que cet ingrédient spécial est ?${prompt}
  7501: |-
    Ce sont des Gobelins. Non, pas les Gobelins eux-mêmes, idiot.
    Ils ont un feu de camp dans les montagnes qui a des propriétés spéciales, vous voyez ?
    Tout ce que vous avez à faire est de mettre ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} dedans pendant juste un petit moment...${prompt}
  7502: |-
    Et presto ! Vous obtenez ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} ! C'est aussi simple que ça.
    Monter là-haut n'est pas facile, mais ça ne devrait pas poser de problème pour un aventurier comme vous.${prompt}
  7503: |-
    Un ami aventurier m'en a rapporté un autre fois, et mmm-mmm !
    Mon dieu, c'était délicieux !!!${prompt}
  7504: Vous pouvez mettre des objets en vente ou enchérir sur des objets à cette maison d'enchères.${prompt}
  7505: Personnellement, je crois que la joie de miser et d'acheter des objets lors de ces enchères est un privilège que seuls de véritables connaisseurs, comme moi, peuvent pleinement apprécier.${prompt}
  7506: Ici, dans les Marchés, ils vendent des instruments, des bijoux, des armes, des armures, des marchandises... Tout ce que quelqu'un pourrait jamais vouloir !${prompt}
  7507: L'avenir de cette ville est aussi radieux que le mien !${prompt}
  7508: Mon père dit que dans cette ville, vous pouvez faire n'importe quoi tant que vous avez l'argent pour le payer !${prompt}

    Tenez, prenez mon ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}

    Vous êtes ici pour la chasse aux timbres ?
    Pourquoi les aventuriers le font-ils, je me demande.

    La maison au bout de ce canal est la maison d'Arawn.
    La mienne est juste à côté, à l'ouest, en face de la boutique de musique de Harmodios.${prompt}
  7517: Ce pont relie les Mines et le Quartier des Marchés.${prompt}
  7518: |-
    Les Galka dans le Quartier des Mines sont une bande de rustres.
    Pour vous dire la vérité, je suis content de ne pas être de service là-bas.${prompt}
  7519: Mon mari est toujours en train d'aventurer, mon fils joue toute la journée, et mon beau-père raconte les choses les plus étranges...${prompt}
  7520: Augh ! Mon célibat me manque...${prompt}
  7521: |-
    Oh non ! Nous sommes encore à court de ${item-plural: 7[2]}.
    Je me demande pourquoi...${prompt}

    Je ne peux pas cuisiner sans feu, mais je n'ai pas le temps d'aller faire des courses !

  7525: |-
    Hmm ? Ah, les sources chaudes dans le Dangruf Wadi ?
    C'étaient géniales ! Je me suis senti comme un homme nouveau après m'y être baigné !${prompt}
  7526: J'aurais aimé qu'elles aient été construites à l'époque où j'étais praefectus de la légion...${prompt}
  7527: |-
    Vous voulez gagner de l'argent ? Achetez à bas prix, et vendez à un prix élevé !
    C'est ma devise !${prompt}
  7528: |-
    Les marchands de la ville sont tous des escrocs !
    N'achetez pas chez eux, ils vous dépouilleront !
    Achetez des objets pas chers auprès de gens qui n'en ont pas besoin.${prompt}
  7529: |-
    Puis vendez-les à ceux qui en ont besoin — pour plus que ce que vous les avez achetés, bien sûr !
    “Examinez” les gens pour voir quel type d'objets ils recherchent.
    C'est comme ça qu'on fait des affaires !${prompt}
  7530: Vous avez l'air surpris. Vous trouvez ça inhabituel de voir une dame de haute naissance dans sa propre cuisine, peut-être ?${prompt}
  7531: |-
    Je crois que cuisiner est un passe-temps raffiné digne de moi.
    J'utilise bien sûr les meilleurs ingrédients que le gil peut acheter.${prompt}

  7539: Grâce à vous, je vais préparer le meilleur plat qui soit !${prompt}
  7540: Je suis orfèvre, mais je ne travaille pas pour la guilde.${prompt}

    Les véritables orfèvres sont des artistes et des artisans. Mais les orfèvres de la guilde ne font que les mêmes bibelots encore et encore.
    Ce n'est tout simplement pas juste !${prompt}
  7542: Alors que les gens marchent dans ces rues, la plupart s'émerveillent de la technologie Hume utilisée pour construire les roues hydrauliques et les ponts-levis de cette ville.${prompt}

    Quoi qu'il en soit, voici le ${item-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}
  7595: |-
    Pourquoi le garde me surveille-t-il ? Oh, ce n'est rien dont vous deviez vous inquiéter.
    Au fait, ma maison se trouve dans le District des Mines, dans la zone de logements inférieure.
    Il n'y a pas beaucoup de Mithra, donc ça ne devrait pas être trop dur à trouver.${prompt}
  7596: |-
    Maudit garde !
    Je dois aussi gagner ma vie !
    Allez, détournez le regard !${prompt}

  7611: Bienvenue !${prompt}
  7612: |-
    Bonjour. Avez-vous un moment ? J'ai besoin de votre aide.
    Je pensais offrir un cadeau à Monsieur Dalzakk à côté...${prompt}
  7613: Vous voyez, quand j'ai perdu mes deux parents à cause de la guerre il y a vingt ans, Monsieur Dalzakk m'a pris sous son aile, même si j'étais Elvaan. Il est comme un père pour moi, et je l'aime beaucoup.${prompt}
  7614: Je veux lui montrer que le temps et l'argent qu'il a dépensés pour m'élever n'étaient pas perdus. Je veux lui faire un cadeau avec ce que je fais de mieux -- de la bijouterie.${prompt}
  7615: |-
    C'est ce dont j'ai besoin de votre aide.
    Pourriez-vous m'apporter ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} ?
    Je vous récompenserai avec ce que je peux.${prompt}
  7616: |-
    Merci !
    Ce n'est pas grand-chose, mais je veux que vous ayez ça.
    Je dois me mettre au travail tout de suite !${prompt}
  7617: Salut ! Vous êtes l'aventurier qui a aidé Michea à faire son cadeau, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7618: |-
    Je fais un cadeau à Monsieur Dalzakk aussi, et j'ai besoin de votre aide !
    Il me manque ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}, pour la touche finale !
    En avez-vous ? Pourriez-vous m'en apporter ?${prompt}
  7619: |-
    Merci !
    Maintenant je peux finir mon cadeau !${prompt}
  7620: Gwill ! Monsieur Dalzakk est de retour !${prompt}
  7621: Oh non ! Si tôt !?${prompt}
  7622: |-
    Hmm ?
    Quel est tout ce bruit ?${prompt}
  7623: |-
    Bon retour, Monsieur Dalzakk !
    Euh... Michea, c'est à toi en premier !${prompt}
  7624: |-
    Monsieur Dalzakk... j'ai fait ça pour vous. C'est un porte-bonheur pour vous protéger lors de vos voyages.
    Vous voyez ? N'êtes-vous pas d'accord que je n'ai rien à apprendre de cette guilde ?${prompt}
  7625: |-
    Yes, I must say you've become quite an artisan.
    But artisans should never work for free, Michea.${prompt}
  7626: I knew you'd say that. Just think of it as a payment from me to you, for all the years you've taken care of me... Thank you for everything, Mister Dalzakk.${prompt}
  7627: I...I made you a present, too. It's for letting me stay here and read your books.${prompt}
  7628: |-
    You have been practicing with your sword as well, I hope?
    Remember what I've told you: though studying is important, no scholar has ever become a Musketeer nor an adventurer.${prompt}
  7629: Augh... No, I haven't forgotten, Mister Dalzakk...${prompt}
  7630: |-
    I am sorry, Gwill. I did not mean to sound critical.
    Thank you for your gifts. They mean a lot to me.
    Alas, I must be off again.
    Gwill, would you take care of the house for me?${prompt}
  7631: And Michea, do you now have an answer to my riddle about the true value of the red rose?${prompt}
  7632: Yes. Each person might see a different shade of red, but the fact that we can all agree on its beauty--that is a miracle.${prompt}
  7633: |-
    A wise answer.
    The day I will have to call you “Master Artisan Michea” is nearer than I thought.${prompt}
  7634: Huh? What? What red rose?${prompt}
  7635: Gwill, have you ever wondered if everyone sees the same color when they look at a rose?${prompt}
  7636: What if, when people say “red,” they don't mean the same hue as you or I?${prompt}
  7637: You mean...just because everyone says fires and sunsets are “red,” they're not actually seeing the same color?${prompt}
  7638: Yes. And if so, is the red rose truly beautiful, as it is said to be?${prompt}
  7639: 'Oh! And so your answer was: even if everyone doesn''t see the same thing the same way, it''s wonderful that they can all agree on a thing of beauty--like a red rose!${prompt}'
  7640: |-
    That is the answer, Gwill.
    I see you've studied Mister Dalzakk's books well.${prompt}
  7641: Heh-heh!${prompt}
  7642: |-
    I think sometimes life works the same way, too.
    Like us, for example. We might be of different races and ages, but here, today, in this small room above the Kulatz Bridge, we were able to share the same few moments of joy and wonderment.${prompt}
  7643: And that's...a miracle, right?${prompt}
  7644: Yes, our own little miracle, Gwill.${prompt}
  7645: Qu'est-ce qu'on doit faire, je me demande-blague.${prompt}
  7646: |-
    Vous ! Vous êtes un aventurier, oui-oui ?
    Et vous avez de l'entrain dans votre détermination, à vous en croire !
    Alors vous pouvez m'aider !${prompt}
  7647: |-
    Je compile un tome sur les sorts magiques.
    Il est presque complet--il me faut juste une page sur les malédictions !${prompt}
  7648: |-
    Mais les malédictions sont effrayantes-angoissantes !
    Ce n'est pas pour des gens socialement respectables comme moi !
    C'est là que vous entrez en jeu !${prompt}
  7649: 'J’ai besoin que vous apportiez ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} au bastion des Quadavs à Beadeaux, et que vous soyez maudit par les deux types de statues--les Muets et les Afflictés !${prompt}'
  7650: |-
    Quand ce sera fait, le ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} aura capturé leurs secrets !
    Ramenez-le vite-fait, et mon tome sera complet !${prompt}
  7651: |-
    Bon ! Le ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} est plein !
    Je peux enfin terminer mes recherches !
    Heh-heh-heh...${prompt}
  7652: |-
    Oh oui, votre récompense !
    Tenez, ils sont à vous, à vous !${prompt}
  7653: |-
    Mes recherches approchent de leur achèvement !
    Heh-heh-heh...${prompt}
  7654: |-
    Hah ! Yah ! Je suis encore en vie et plein d'énergie !
    Voulez-vous savoir comment je peux être si énergique à mon âge ?
    Je vous le dirai si vous me rapportez l'ingrédient secret de ma formule !${prompt}
  7655: |-
    Vous voyez ce vieil Hume là-bas qui semble un peu trop jeune pour son âge ?
    J'ai vu un aventurier lui apporter des ${item-plural: 7[2]} une fois.${prompt}
  7656: 'La rumeur dit qu''il broie ces ${item-plural: 7[2]} en poudre et en avale un peu chaque jour.${prompt}'
  7657: Une bien triste histoire, si c'est vrai. Imaginez, manger les restes des morts dans l'espoir de tenir la mort à distance !${prompt}
  7658: Oui, c'est l'ingrédient secret ! Ah, mais ce n'est pas ce que vous pensez - je ne le mange pas, comme certains le croient.${prompt}
  7659: |-
    Je le garde dans une poche près de mon cœur pour me rappeler ma propre mortalité.
    C'est mon secret. Hmm... Peut-être êtes-vous encore trop jeune pour comprendre.${prompt}
  7660: Hah ! Yah ! Je suis encore vivant et en forme !${prompt}
  7661: |-
    Ceci est la Guilde des Orfèvres.
    Ne pénétrez pas dans les locaux sauf si vous avez affaire avec la guilde.${prompt}
  7662: |-
    Hmm... Ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} semble contenir des traces de mythril.
    Pas assez pour valoir grand-chose, malheureusement.${prompt}
  7663: Je suis prêt à vous l'acheter, mais je ne peux vous offrir plus de dix gil pour ça.${prompt}
  7664: |-
    Le vendre pour 10 gil ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  7665: Le voici.${prompt}
  7666: |-
    Vous retournez à Windurst ?
    Je suis désolé de n'avoir pu rendre votre voyage ici utile.${prompt}
  7667: |-
    Oui ? La pierre que vous m'avez vendue l'autre jour ?
    Vous voulez dire celle avec des traces de mythril ?${prompt}
  7668: Je suis désolé, mais je crois que ça a déjà été utilisé par l'un de nos membres de guilde dans son travail.${prompt}
  7669: |-
    Ouais ?
    Tu es un pêcheur ?${prompt}
  7670: |-
    Tu as déjà pêché ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.

    Alors je n'ai rien à faire avec toi.
    Dégage.${prompt}
  7672: |-
    Très bien, tu as des ${item-plural: 7[2]} ?
    Ne le prends pas mal, je ne dis pas que tu n'es pas bon là-dedans ou quoi que ce soit.
    Tout le monde commence par attraper ça, non ?${prompt}
  7673: |-
    Si tu en as quelques-uns qui traînent, je te les achète.
    Cinq à la fois, seulement. Marché conclu ?${prompt}
  7674: |-
    Qu'est-ce que j'en fais ? Du business, tu sais, du business.
    Je les nettoie et je les revends.
    Ces gros bonnets dans les Ateliers métalliques les achètent comme des fous.${prompt}
  7675: |-
    Un conseil, si tu veux commencer ton propre business : achète pas cher, vends cher.
    Il y a une autre raison pour laquelle je peux gagner ma vie en vendant des seaux, pourtant.${prompt}
  7676: |-
    Les gens adorent dépenser des gil qui ne sont pas les leurs.
    Et personne ne dépense plus que ces gros bonnets dans les Ateliers métalliques.
    Ça rend mon boulot facile.${prompt}
  7677: |-
    Bon, ça fait cinq. Content de faire affaire avec toi.
    J'espère que tu ne deviendras pas meilleur à la pêche de sitôt, heh heh.${prompt}
  7678: Salut. Je m'appelle Julio. Je suis un alchimiste non licencié. Heh-heh.${prompt}
  7679: Je sais ce que vous voulez--vous voulez voir mon Tableau des Corrélations Élémentaires, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7680: |-
    Voir le Tableau des Corrélations Élémentaires ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  7681: Quoi !? Pas intéressé, hein !? Alors laissez-moi tranquille ! Fiche le camp !${prompt}
  7682: |-
    Je le savais !
    Regardez ça !${prompt}
  7683: |-
    Connaissez-vous les éléments principaux ?
    Ce sont les huit éléments et énergies qui contrôlent l'univers.
    Ce tableau montre leur interrelation.${prompt}
  7684: |-
    Voyez-vous ici ?
    Les six sur l'anneau extérieur sont en ascendance cyclique les uns sur les autres.${prompt}
  7685: |-
    Donc cela montre que :
    l'eau éteint le feu,
    le feu fond la glace, et
    la glace se dresse contre le vent...${prompt}
  7686: |-
    De plus :
    le vent ronge la terre,
    la terre absorbe la foudre, et
    la foudre fait bouillir l'eau.${prompt}
  7687: Les deux au centre, la lumière et l'obscurité, sont en opposition directe l'un à l'autre.${prompt}
  7688: Une chose de plus--ces éléments affectent également votre statut physique.${prompt}
  7689: Souhaitez-vous que je vous explique en détail ?${prompt}
  7690: |-
    Demander plus de détails ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  7691: |-
    Chaque affliction est liée à un élément :
    la maladie au feu, le lien à la glace,
    le silence au vent, la paralysie à la terre,
    l'étourdissement à la foudre, et le poison à l'eau.${prompt}
  7692: Le charme est lié à la lumière, tandis que la cécité, la malédiction et le sommeil sont tous liés à l'obscurité.${prompt}
  7693: Si vous portez un équipement ayant certaines affinités élémentaires, cela vous aidera à éviter les afflictions correspondantes.${prompt}
  7694: |-
    Homme ou bête, arbre ou mer, toutes choses sont faites de ces huit éléments.
    Cette connaissance devrait vous aider à voir le monde tel qu'il est vraiment.${prompt}
  7695: Besoin d'envoyer quelque chose chez un ami ? Envoyer des objets dans votre propre chambre ? Vous êtes au bon endroit !${prompt}
  7696: Oh là là, quel aventurier mal habillé ! Vous ne pouvez pas vous promener habillé comme ça ! Pas si moi, Brygid, styliste extraordinaire, ai quelque chose à dire là-dessus !${prompt}
  7697: |-
    Laissez-moi voir... Pour une personne de votre taille et stature, ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} et ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} devraient faire l'affaire !
    Oui, je le vois maintenant ! Vous aurez l'air fabuleux !${prompt}
  7698: |-
    Ne vous inquiétez pas, je ne vous ferai pas payer cette fois.
    Faites-moi confiance et allez faire du shopping !${prompt}
  7699: |-
    Vous voyez, qu'est-ce que je vous ai dit ? Vous êtes magnifique, mon cher.
    Et vous devriez aussi mettre ceux-ci. Portez-les, ils sont à vous !${prompt}
  7700: |-
    Oui ? Vous avez une commande pour un orfèvre Elvaan ?
    Eh bien, je suis le seul orfèvre Elvaan dans cette ville...${prompt}
  7701: |-
    Ah, bien sûr, c'est de la part de Tante Femitte.
    Seule elle pourrait être aussi obscure.${prompt}
  7702: |-
    Très bien, je le ferai.
    Mais il me manque le matériau clé.
    Avez-vous ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} ?
    J'en aurai besoin pour fabriquer ça.${prompt}
  7703: |-
    J'ai besoin de ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.
    Veuillez en trouver un et l'apporter.${prompt}
  7704: |-
    Merci.
    Je vais commencer à travailler tout de suite.
    Revenez dans un moment, s'il vous plaît.${prompt}
  7705: "J'ai terminé l'objet que ma tante Femitte a commandé.\nVeuillez le ramener avec soin. \nEt dites à ma tante et à Rouva que je leur fais bonjour.${prompt}"
  7706: |-
    Rouva a dit ça ?
    Oui... Je suppose que je peux en parler maintenant.
    J'étais, bien sûr, dévastée que mes proches me rejettent.${prompt}
  7707: Mais Tante Femitte m'a dit alors que même si tout le monde ne voulait pas me reprendre, je serais toujours la bienvenue chez elle. Cela m'a beaucoup touchée.${prompt}
  7708: |-
    Mais je ne peux pas encore partir.
    D'abord, je dois essayer de me faire un nom ici.
    Imaginez une fille Elvaan devenant célèbre à Bastok !
    C'est mon objectif et mon rêve.${prompt}
  7709: |-
    Bienvenue à la boutique de la Guilde des Orfèvres.

    Avez-vous des questions sur notre établissement ?${prompt}
  7729: |-
    Que voulez-vous savoir ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Qu'est-ce que la maison des enchères ?
    Comment se déroulent les enchères ?
    Y a-t-il des frais ?
    Y a-t-il des limites ?
    Comment vérifier les marchandises ?
    Comment retirer un objet ?
    Ma liste “État des ventes” est pleine !
    Rien pour l'instant.${prompt}
  7730: Les maisons de vente aux enchères peuvent être trouvées dans toutes les grandes villes de Vana'diel. Ici, les aventuriers se rassemblent pour enchérir sur des butins de bataille, des objets indésirables, de vieilles armures... presque tout.${prompt}
  7731: Actuellement, les maisons de vente aux enchères à Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst et Jeuno fonctionnent toutes indépendamment. Par conséquent, les prix diffèrent d'une ville à l'autre.${prompt}
  7732: Les aventuriers peuvent utiliser n'importe quelle maison de vente aux enchères, quelle que soit leur nationalité.${prompt}
  7733: Le premier aventurier à enchérir à un prix égal ou supérieur au prix demandé achètera automatiquement le produit.${prompt}
  7734: Une fois mise aux enchères, la marchandise restera là pour un maximum de trente semaines en temps de Vana'diel (neuf jours et demi en temps terrestre).${prompt}
  7735: Si la marchandise ne se vend pas dans ce délai, elle sera renvoyée au domicile actuel du vendeur.${prompt}
  7736: Les frais de transaction sont proportionnels au montant pour lequel un article est mis aux enchères. La méthode de calcul de ce frais est différente pour les articles uniques et les articles empilables.${prompt}
  7737: Des frais de transaction sont prélevés lorsque n'importe quelle marchandise est mise aux enchères. Ce frais est non remboursable.${prompt}
  7738: Le Comité International des Maisons de Vente aux Enchères, ou IAHC, a déclaré qu'un maximum de sept articles pouvait être mis aux enchères à la fois.${prompt}
  7739: Cependant, l'IAHC a récemment supprimé la limite sur le nombre d'articles que l'on peut acheter.${prompt}
  7740: Un petit temps est nécessaire avant que de nouvelles marchandises apparaissent sur notre liste d'enchères.${prompt}
  7741: Une fois qu'un article apparaît sur votre liste « État de vente », il peut ne pas apparaître immédiatement sur la liste d'enchères. Si vous ne voyez pas votre article sur la liste d'enchères, essayez de regarder à nouveau plus tard.${prompt}
  7742: Si vous souhaitez retirer un article d'une enchère, vous devez vous rendre à la maison de vente aux enchères et sélectionner « Arrêter la vente » dans le menu « État de vente ».${prompt}
  7743: Pour retirer un article de votre liste « État de vente », vous devez visiter un comptoir d'enchères pour reconnaître la vente ou le retour de votre marchandise.${prompt}
  7744: Sinon, les articles précédemment vendus ou retournés rempliront votre liste et vous empêcheront de vendre d'autres marchandises.${prompt}
  7745: À n'importe quel comptoir d'enchères, ouvrez le menu « État de vente » et reconnaissez la transaction pour la supprimer de la liste.${prompt}
  7746: Appuyez sur le bouton de confirmation pour retirer toute transaction colorée en jaune (vendue) ou en rouge (retournée).${prompt}
  7747: Y a-t-il autre chose que vous aimeriez savoir ?${prompt}
  7748: Dans le passé, beaucoup ont amassé de grandes richesses grâce à la maison de vente aux enchères. J'espère que vous trouverez également la fortune !${prompt}

    Conquêtes.
    Résultats des conquêtes.
    Faire des dons de cristaux.
    Points de conquête.
    Les effets du contrôle des régions.
    Régions contrôlées par d’autres nations.
    Régions sous contrôle des bêtes.${prompt}
  7825: Les trois nations travaillent chaque jour à étendre leur domination sur de nouvelles régions. C’est ce que nous appelons les « conquêtes ». Vous pouvez y contribuer et servir votre pays en triomphant des ennemis alors que le Signe vous est attribué.${prompt}
  7826: Chaque région est composée de plusieurs zones. La nation qui élimine le plus de monstres dans ces zones en prend le contrôle.${prompt}
  7827: Les nations tirent des ressources et des biens des régions qu’elles dominent.${prompt}
  7828: Ainsi, plus nous contrôlons de régions, plus notre nation prospère.${prompt}
  7829: |-
    Des gardes-frontières sont postés dans des avant-postes au sein des régions que nous contrôlons.
    Leur rôle est d’apposer le Signe sur des aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
  7830: Une fois marqué par le Signe de votre nation, vous pourrez récupérer des cristaux sur les ennemis que vous terrassez.${prompt}
  7831: Mieux encore, vous gagnerez des points de conquête. Ces points seront plus nombreux si vous triomphez d’ennemis dans des régions hors de notre contrôle. Vous pourrez les échanger contre des objets auprès de gardes comme moi.${prompt}
  7832: |-
    Vous comprenez donc que les conquêtes profitent autant aux nations qu’aux aventuriers.
    Nous comptons sur vous pour donner le meilleur de vous-même au service de notre pays.${prompt}
  7833: |-
    Pour suivre l’état des conquêtes, consultez « Info sur la région » dans le menu principal.
    Les résultats sont régulièrement mis à jour pour toutes les régions, alors jetez-y un œil de temps en temps.${prompt}
  7834: |-
    Les boutiques de notre ville proposeront des objets variés selon notre rang de conquête.
    La Troupe Valeriano rendra aussi visite à la nation en tête pour égayer ses habitants.${prompt}
  7835: |-
    Dès que vous atteignez le rang 2, vous pouvez offrir des cristaux à votre nation.
    Remettez-les simplement à des gardes comme moi, et nous les acheminerons au bon endroit.${prompt}
  7836: |-
    Nous vous encourageons dès maintenant à faire don de cristaux à votre nation.
    Confiez-les à des gardes comme moi, et nous nous chargerons de les transmettre correctement.${prompt}
  7837: |-
    Vous obtiendrez des cristaux en terrassant des ennemis sous le Signe de votre nation.
    Ce Signe est aussi le seul moyen de prendre part aux conquêtes.${prompt}
  7838: Chaque cristal offert vous rapportera des points de rang, et de nouvelles missions pourront vous être confiées à mesure que votre rang augmente.${prompt}
  7839: |-
    Réussir des missions vous fait aussi gagner des points de rang.
    Accomplissez des missions et participez aux conquêtes pour faire progresser votre rang et servir votre pays.${prompt}
  7840: |-
    Vaincre des monstres pendant les conquêtes vous récompense en points de conquête.
    Consultez « Info sur la région » dans le menu pour vérifier votre total actuel.${prompt}
  7841: 'Avec ces points de conquête, vous pouvez acheter des objets auprès de gardes comme moi, mais attention : chaque dépense réduit votre total.${prompt}'
  7842: Quand les résultats des conquêtes sont proclamés, vous saurez quelle nation domine la région où vous vous trouvez. Parfois, certaines régions deviennent neutres, ou pire, tombent aux mains des bêtes.${prompt}
  7843: Si nous prenons une région, des gardes-frontières occuperont ses avant-postes pour soutenir des aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
  7844: Des marchands s’y installeront aussi, et les produits de cette région arriveront jusque dans nos boutiques locales.${prompt}
  7845: Dominer les régions, voilà l’essence des conquêtes. Nous avons besoin de vous tous pour exceller et hisser notre nation au sommet.${prompt}
  7846: Évidemment, il arrive que d’autres nations nous ravissent des régions… Il faut alors les reconquérir avant l’annonce des prochains résultats.${prompt}
  7847: Pour vous motiver, nous vous offrirons plus de points de conquête en triomphant des monstres dans ces régions.${prompt}
  7848: En revanche, si nous sommes alliés à une autre nation, vous gagnerez le taux normal en combattant dans leurs régions. Par contre, affronter des ennemis dans les terres de la nation dominante rapportera davantage de points.${prompt}
  7849: |-
    Ce qui nous inquiète le plus, c’est que les bêtes s’emparent de nos régions.
    Si trop des nôtres tombent dans une région, elle passera sous leur contrôle.${prompt}
  7850: Si cela arrive, c’est un rude coup pour notre honneur, et vous ne pourrez plus y récolter de cristaux.${prompt}
  7851: Les bêtes menacent toutes les nations. Si elles prennent le pouvoir, nous devons nous unir pour les chasser de ces terres maudites.${prompt}
  7852: Nous comptons sur vous pour approvisionner les gardes-frontières des avant-postes dans les régions que nous contrôlons.${prompt}
  7853: 'Chaque région a son avant-poste. Allez dans « Info sur la région » au menu et repérez les zones marquées d’un petit drapeau sur la carte : c’est là qu’ils sont.${prompt}'
  7854: |-
    Voici les provisions. Remettez-les au garde de l’avant-poste, et votre mission sera terminée.
    Choisissez maintenant l’avant-poste où vous rendre. Les récompenses diffèrent selon les régions, alors prenez une décision éclairée.${prompt}

    Merci beaucoup.
    Gwill était tellement heureux que tu aies parlé à Dalzakk.${prompt}
  8152: À vrai dire, quelqu’un t’a vu te diriger vers chez Oggbi et m’a dit que je devrais t’accompagner.${prompt}
  8153: Elle m’a conseillé de demander l’aide d’un aventurier si je ne pouvais pas résoudre le problème moi-même. Seule une fille gâtée comme elle pouvait imaginer un tel plan.${prompt}
  8154: Avant, je détestais sa façon d’agir… ne rien faire par elle-même, toujours compter sur les autres…${prompt}
  8155: 'Mais maintenant, je commence à comprendre ce qu’elle ressent. À Bastok, nous sommes dans la même situation : méprisés juste parce que nous sommes un peu différents.${prompt}'
  8156: |-
    Et la seule façon de faire comprendre qui nous sommes, c’est de prouver notre valeur. Elle me l’a appris à travers ses propres expériences.
    Aujourd’hui, je peux dire qu’elle est une véritable amie.${prompt}
  8157: |-
    C’est amusant, non ?
    Qui aurait cru qu’un simple orfèvre elvaan et une fille d’une famille aisée deviendraient les meilleurs amis ?${prompt}

    Hm ? De qui je parle ?
    Mais de Cornelia, bien sûr.
    Vous vous êtes déjà rencontrés, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}

  8160: |-
    Oh, mais c’est Dalzakk !
    Je vois que tu es rentré sain et sauf.${prompt}
  8161: |-
    Est-ce que quelque chose d’étrange s’est passé dans le quartier des Mines pendant mon absence ?
    J’ai un mauvais pressentiment à propos de cet endroit.${prompt}
  8162: Ce n’est pas officiel, mais un garde de là-bas m’a dit que…${prompt}
  8163: Monsieur Dalzakk ! Werei a… Werei a…${prompt}
  8164: Werei a quoi, Gwill ?${prompt}
  8165: On dirait que Werei est parti pour son voyage de renaissance.${prompt}
  8166: Je vois. Nous savions tous que ce jour arriverait tôt ou tard, mais les Galka du quartier des Mines seront quand même attristés…${prompt}
  8167: Que devons-nous faire, Monsieur Dalzakk ?${prompt}
  8168: |-
    Reste calme, Gwill.
    Tu ne peux pas passer ta vie à toujours dépendre des autres.${prompt}
  8169: |-
    Cependant, nous sommes tous inquiets.
    Je vais me préparer à repartir et enquêter sur la disparition de Werei.${prompt}
  8170: Alors ? J’aimerais un rapport sur les activités des aventuriers.${prompt}
  8171: |-
    Capitaine Volker !
    Vous êtes de retour !${prompt}
  8172: Cleades, l’agitation des Galka dans le quartier des Mines a-t-elle commencé à affecter ceux des marchés de Bastok ?${prompt}
  8173: Vu le faible nombre de Galka dans les marchés, je ne pense pas que la disparition de Werei les ait beaucoup touchés.${prompt}
  8174: |-
    Compris.
    Où peut bien être Zeid en un moment pareil ?${prompt}
  8175: Attends. Tu es allé aux Mines de Gusgen. On dit que tu as même vu Zeid. Est-ce vrai ?${prompt}
  8176: Je vois… Il est crucial de le faire revenir à Bastok. Ce pourrait être le seul moyen d’apaiser les cœurs tourmentés des Galka.${prompt}
  8177: |-
    Je n’arrive pas à deviner ce que pense Zeid. J’espère seulement qu’il verra les choses à notre façon.
    Désolé de t’avoir retenu. Je te souhaite du succès dans tes prochaines aventures.${prompt}
  8178: Il y a eu du remue-ménage dans le quartier des Mines, près de la rue du Minerai. Les gens disent qu’un nouveau Conteur est apparu.${prompt}
  8179: Ça me semble suspect, mais avec la disparition de leur aîné, Werei, tout peut arriver. Et la dernière chose qu’on veut, c’est une révolte des Galka.${prompt}
  8180: Rends-toi à la rue du Minerai et parle à Aigle Médecin. Il dit qu’il était là quand le tumulte a commencé.${prompt}
  8181: Je suppose qu’un aventurier de ton calibre a entendu parler de Norg.${prompt}
  8182: Eh bien, cet endroit est un refuge pour les pirates. Ils ont même des liens avec les Tenshodo. Quoi qu’il en soit, c’est une zone qu’on ne peut pas prendre à la légère.${prompt}
  8183: C’est pourquoi nous voulons que tu y ailles en tant qu’émissaire. Présente-toi à Sir Naji au bureau du président pour les détails.${prompt}
  8184: En ce moment, l’ingénieur en chef Cid mène des recherches sur l’architecture de Ro’Maeve, près du Sanctuaire de Zi’Tah. Ta prochaine mission est de t’y rendre et de l’aider.${prompt}
  8185: Va voir l’ingénieur en chef aux Ateliers pour plus de détails.${prompt}
  8186: Nous recherchons un aventurier qui détient des informations cruciales liées à une certaine enquête nationale.${prompt}
  8187: Le président lui-même a exprimé un grand intérêt pour cette affaire. Rends-toi au bureau du président pour les détails de cette mission.${prompt}
  8188: 'Tu as reçu l’ordre du président de livrer cet ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. Quand tu auras accompli cette tâche, tu pourras revenir ici pour ta prochaine mission.${prompt}'
  8189: On dirait que Bastok va vraiment entamer une enquête sur Altepa, la patrie des Galka.${prompt}
  8190: Ton rôle dans cette enquête te mènera aux Grottes de Sables Mouvants. Obtiens les détails de cette mission auprès d’Iron Eater au bureau du président.${prompt}
  8191: En prolongement de l’enquête de Bastok sur Altepa, cette fois-ci, tu voyageras jusqu’à l’île de Zepwell.${prompt}
  8192: Tu mèneras ta part de l’enquête dans le Tunnel de Kuftal, qui relie le Cap Teriggan à l’île de Zepwell. Parle à Drake Fang dans les Mines Zeruhn pour les détails.${prompt}
  8193: Le sénateur Alois a demandé ton assistance.${prompt}
  8194: Il s’agit d’une expédition à Vollbow…${prompt}
  8195: J’espère juste qu’il ne te demande pas d’aller chercher des œufs de lézard à nouveau… Attends, tu n’as pas entendu ça de moi.${prompt}
  8196: Récemment, une aventurière envoyée enquêter dans les Terres du Nord a été attaquée.${prompt}
  8197: Selon son rapport, l’attaquant ressemblait au chevalier noir Zeid.${prompt}
  8198: Le plus étrange, c’est que l’assaillant lui a remis une lettre avant de la laisser partir. Maintenant, le contenu de cette lettre cause tout un émoi au bureau du président.${prompt}
  8199: On t’a demandé de te présenter directement au président Karst pour plus de détails.${prompt}
  8200: Tu veux que je jette un œil à cette boucle d’oreille ? Hmmm…${prompt}
  8201: Eh bien, c’est curieux. Une cliente est venue l’autre jour et m’a demandé de fabriquer une boucle d’oreille identique à celle-ci. Elle disait avoir perdu l’une des deux de la paire.${prompt}
  8202: Je lui ai dit qu’il m’était impossible de remplacer la boucle perdue, alors je suis sûr qu’elle serait ravie si tu la lui rendais. Je crois qu’elle a dit s’appeler Esca.${prompt}

  8419: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  8420: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  8421: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  8422: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  8423: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  8424: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  8425: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  8426: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  8427: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  8428: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  8429: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  8430: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  8431: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  8432: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  8433: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  8434: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  8435: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  8436: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  8437: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  8438: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  8439: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  8440: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  8441: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  8442: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  8443: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  8444: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  8445: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  8446: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}

    Kupo?
    What happened to your ten-person party?
    You can't trick presents out of me, kupo!${prompt}
  8617: |-
    Ooh, a shiny new adventurer!
    Join in the fun, kupo!${prompt}
  8618: |-
    You can only celebrate the Doll Festival once a day.
    Try again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt}
  8619: |-
    Hey!
    Your party has different members all of a sudden!
    Well, I guess I can give you this for having the right number of people at least, kupo!${prompt}
  8620: |-
    Hey!
    Your party has lost touch with its feminine side!
    You need to find yourself a lady, kupo!${prompt}
  8621: |-
    Hmm...
    You seem to have lost your male element.
    Can't have the guys running away from you, kupo!${prompt}

  8626: Celestial Nights has begun, kupo!${prompt}
  8627: An event based on the timeless, tear-jerking tale of tragedy between Prince Yahiko of the Eastern Nation and Princess Amdina of the Western Nation is being held, kupo!${prompt}
  8628: In an interpretive recreation of the tale, two actors have assumed the roles of the prince and princess on a sizzling hot date!${prompt}
  8629: But all is not well...${prompt}
  8630: You see, the town is overflowing with alluringly attractive ladies, kupo.${prompt}
  8631: |-
    Why is that such a bad thing, you ask?
    By distracting the prince from giving his undivided attention to the princess, these vivacious vixens could ruin the event, kupo.${prompt}
  8632: |-
    That must not be allowed to happen!
    If the actor in the prince's role threatens towards fickleness, it's your duty to slap him back to reality--literally!${prompt}
  8633: |-
    And we can't forget about the actress playing the princess, either.
    She's under a lot of pressure to perform, and is prone to being plagued with severe self-doubt about her feelings towards her co-star, kupo.${prompt}
  8634: Only with your moral support could she hope to maintain confidence and perform at her brilliant best. A simple nod would go a long way to reaffirm positive thoughts, while a shake of the head would do wonders to cast out negative ones, kupo!${prompt}
  8635: And going back to the scandalous seductresses I mentioned earlier, you can prevent them from disrupting this royal rendezvous by turning their attention to you. A wave of the hand should do the trick, kupo!${prompt}
  8636: Whatever happens, you must ensure that the date--the event--goes smoothly! I pray for your success on this most meaningful of missions, kupo!${prompt}
  8637: |-
    Princess Amdina, mine one and only!
    I have so longed to once more behold thee! Thou art even more beautiful than when last we met!
  8638: "Thy words pleaseth me, my sweet prince. \nI, too, have ached to be by thy side again."
  8639: Let us make this a reunion that shall never be forgotten! Shall we, my princess?
  8640: Yes, my prince!
  8641: Prince Yahiko, pray forgive me my boldness...but there is something I desire.
  8642: Thou needest but name it, and thine it shall be! There is naught I would deny thee, apple of mine eye.
  8643: |-
    <Blush>...${wait-36: 2}
    Even if thy heart is what I desire, my prince?
  8644: |-
    Hahaha!
    My princess, mine heart has been thine since the day I first laid mine eyes upon thee.
  8645: |-
    Prince Yahiko, pray tell me true...
    I would know why thou dost love me so.
  8646: To answer thy question fully is to tell a tale grander than the greatest epics. Thy beautiful almond eyes that glimmer brighter than the most precious jewels...thy voice of honey that resoundeth more sweetly than angel song...
  8647: Thine entire being is as a soothing spring rain that hath come to nourish the arid desert of my lonely existence.
  8648: |-
    <Blush>...
    My...my prince...I know not what to say...
  8649: Prince Yahiko?
  8650: What is it, my precious?
  8651: |-
    <Blush>...
    It...it is nothing...
  8652: Sweet princess, thou needest not hide anything from me.
  8653: Oooh, that's a good man if I've ever seen one.
  8654: |-
    Yoohoo! Mister Prince!
    You got some time to spare? I'd appreciate the company of a good man like you.
  8655: A-and who dost thou assume to be?
  8656: (Is this shameless woman trying to seduce him!?)
  8657: |-
    Ahem!
    Thou art kind to offer, but as thou canst see, thy company is quite unnecessary!
  8658: |-
    My, aren't you feisty?
    Judging from your reaction, you've got a soft spot for him? Isn't that rich!
  8659: Well, Mister Prince? You coming or what?
  8660: Such charm...such confidence...
  8661: P-Prince Yahiko! Whither dost thou think...!
  8662: I-I must know thy name!
  8663: That's for me to know, and for you to find out.♪
  8664: I beseech thee, fair maiden!
  8665: |-
    Huh? What's wrong with me?
    I worked so hard to land the leading role for this event, but I almost threw it all away...
  8666: See you around, Mister Prince.♪
  8667: |-
    Princess Amdina! My beloved!
    Please, find it in thy heart to forgive this foolish prince!
  8668: |-
    Hmph!${wait-36: 2}
    <Sigh>... I believed thou wouldst return to me, my prince.
  8669: Never again shall I leave thy side! This, I swear upon mine honor!
  8670: What?
  8671: Thanks for the attention, but I've got my eyes on Mister Prince over there. See you around!
  8672: Look, I don't have time to get all buddy-buddy with you, okay? Bye.
  8673: (I never imagined my co-star would be so handsome! <Sigh> I wish time would stand still...)
  8674: (Some day my prince will come...♪)
  8675: (I must have been out of my mind to wish for time to stand still. That's just plain selfish.)
  8676: (He must be really popular with the girls... I wonder what he thinks of me?)
  8677: (Oh, golly gosh! He's staring right at me! What do I do, what do I do!?)
  8678: (Oh wow, that girl over there is really well endo--what!? He's checking her out! How could he!?)
  8679: (Just walking beside him makes my heart beat like crazy! Have I finally mastered method acting? Or is this something...more?)
  8680: (This feeling...it's undeniable. I...I've fallen for him. Somebody, tell me what to do!)
  8681: (On second thought...maybe I'm just a bit run-down. That could also explain why my heart's racing like this.)
  8682: (My co-star...he's so kind, handsome, and intelligent... Perfect in every way!)
  8683: (The man of my dreams, right here in front of me! How could this be true?)
  8684: (What was I thinking? His being perfect is just an act. I can't believe I mixed up reality like that...)
  8685: (Aaah... How wonderful life would be if I had a boyfriend like him. But, do I deserve such happiness...?)
  8686: (But, of course I deserve to be happy! Everybody does!)
  8687: (Such happiness couldn't possibly last, and before long...)
  8688: (The same rehearsed lines over and over... This is getting boring. Couldn't he ad-lib or something?)
  8689: (What was I complaining about, I wonder? It doesn't matter at all that we're just trading lines. Being with him here is more than enough!)
  8690: (And I thought he was a good actor. How disappointing...)
  8691: (Maybe we're just not compatible with each other? If that's the case, there's nothing I can do...）
  8692: (Why am I doubting myself like this? After all, even he complimented me on being perfect for the role, the princess reborn! I've got to be more confident!)
  8693: (It's only a matter of time before he starts hating me...)
  8694: (He sure does walk slowly. Shouldn't we be proceeding at a faster pace?)
  8695: (Why on Vana'diel did I ever complain about going too slow? The slower we walk, the longer I get to be with him!)
  8696: (Come on, come on, walk faster already! Grrr, I can't stand this guy!）
  8697: (He hasn't said a word for ages now. Doesn't he like my company?)
  8698: (Oh, golly gosh, he's forgotten his lines! I better take the initiative and get us back on track...)
  8699: (I can't stand this silence anymore... Please, say something! Anything!)
  8700: (He sure is confident around women... Too confident...)
  8701: (Me and my overactive imagination... He's simply a gentleman who knows how to treat women. Nothing wrong with that.)
  8702: (He's just a despicable womanizer! He may be a good actor, but the disguise doesn't fool me!)
  8703: (Maybe it'd be better if I quit playing this role...)
  8704: |-
    Princess Amdina!
    Whither dost thou go?
  8705: What troubleth thee, my fair princess? Art thou feeling unwell?
  8706: (He...he really cares for me! Deep inside my heart, I knew it all along...)
  8707: |-
    It is nothing, my sweet prince, nothing at all.
    Now, let us resume our promenade!
  8708: Citizen, canst thou spare not the courtesy to allow the princess and I this rare private interlude?
  8709: There is not a single woman in the world who can rival the loveliness of my princess!
  8710: As long as I live, no harm shalt ever befall the princess. This, I swear upon mine honor!
  8711: I can bear not even the thought of life without Princess Amdina.
  8712: Only with Princess Amdina doth my existence hold meaning.
  8713: There is not a single moment where the thought of Princess Amdina doth not occupy my mind!
  8714: Citizen, canst thou not see that I am attending to...official business?
  8715: My perfect prince... <Sigh>
  8716: The prince concealeth behind his majestic facade an innocent, childlike aspect that hath awakened my maternal instincts.
  8717: I had always been skeptical towards the idea of destiny. And then I met Prince Yahiko...
  8718: Even when we are far apart, the mere thought of the prince bringeth a comforting warmth to my soul.
  8719: <Sigh> How I hope that one day he will maketh me his bride...
  8720: Only I hold the key which unlocketh his soul!
  8721: |-
    I beseech thee, loyal citizen!
    Deliver the prince back to mine arms!
  8722: |-
    Why, if it isn't my favorite adventurer!
    Hope you're having fun!
  8723: |-
    I...I'm sorry, but I can't do this anymore.
    Please find someone else to play the role.
  8724: Wh-wh-what!?
  8725: Goodbye.
  8726: Hey, wait!
  8727: |-
    Nooo!
    Princess Amdina! Don't leave me!
  8728: Prince Yahiko, I shall never forget our reunion this day.
  8729: Nor I, my dear princess.
  8730: It is our fervent hope that thou hast thoroughly enjoyed the Celestial Nights event.${prompt}
  8731: We present this gift to thee, as a token of our gratitude for thine unrelenting support.${prompt}
  8732: |-
    This year's Sunbreeze Festival has begun!
    A special show is being held at the town square as we speak, kupo!${prompt}
  8733: In this show, everybody's favorite frolicking fraulein, Mumor, goes head-to-head with a powerful minion of the irrepressibly evil demon king, Ullegore!${prompt}
  8734: You, too, have a positively pivotal part to play in this classic battle between good and evil, kupo! Only with your boisterous backing can Mumor hope to claim victory over her determined opponent!${prompt}
  8735: If all her fanatical fans' hearts were to beat as one, the tide of battle would surely turn in Mumor's favor, kupo!${prompt}
  8736: |-
    Watch out for when Mumor prepares to unleash her ultimate attack, the “Dancing Force”!
    This is your cue to turn and face the demon king's minion, and dance like you've never danced before, kupo!${prompt}
  8737: We'll be giving away a special prize to everyone who helps Mumor defeat her opponent, so give it your best, kupo!${prompt}
  8738: And don't forget to check out the multifarious fun-filled festival games that've been set up in all three nations! Have fun, kupo!${prompt}
  8739: I heard from Mumor that you helped her defeat the demon lord's minion! You have our heartfelt gratitude, kupo!${prompt}
  8740: |-
    This is the prize we prepared for you.
    Come back and participate again anytime you want, kupo!${prompt}
  8741: Wow! Your outstanding assistance makes you today's MVP, or most valuable participant!${prompt}
  8742: |-
    Here is your prize as promised!
    Wearing it will earnestly enhance your festive mood, kupo!${prompt}
  8743: |-
    This is the prize we prepared for you.
    Come back and participate again anytime you want, kupo!${prompt}
  8744: |-
    Hello, faithful fans!
    Mighty Maiden Mumor here!
  8745: I want you all to know how special you make me feel by coming out to listen to one of our little ditties!
  8746: |-
    Right, Uka?${wait-36: 2}
    Uka?${wait-36: 2}
    Leaping lizards, where could she have run off to?
  8747: Mwahahahaha!
  8748: Who's there!?
  8749: Ah, Mumor. How many years has it been?
  8750: Cinnamon and gravy, it's Ullegore! I won't let you wipe the smiles off my adoring fans' faces!
  8751: |-
    Oho, but wipe I will!${wait-36: 1}
    Uka, come!
  8752: I am herrre, Lord Ullegore.
  8753: N-no!
  8754: Snap this little twig in two.
  8755: By your command.
  8756: Uka...? What's wrong? Why, after all we've been through?
  8757: We're not friends, Mumor. We never were. I exist only to serve his eminence, Lord Ullegore.
  8758: Eeep!
  8759: Stand strong! Believe in the bonds between you and your prancing partner!
  8760: Diva!
  8761: Ullegore underhandedly usurped Uka's will with wicked wizardry! So stop staring and samba her back to her senses!
  8762: And now you turn your back on me, Diva. Very well. I shall sip your tears tonight as well!
  8763: |-
    W-wait...
    Why am I supporting such a second-rate starlet?
  8764: Well, I positively planted my paw in it. No going back now! Go get 'em, girl!
  8765: Don't let Ullegore frazzle you, Uka! I'll bounce those cobwebs right out of your head!
  8766: C'mon, everyone! Let's show Ullegore the true meaning of dance!
  8767: Grk...
  8768: Keep at it!
  8769: Thanks to all your help, I'm beginning to feel tingly and sparkly! Here we go, my lovelies!
  8770: Neo Crystal Jig!!!
  8771: Super Crusher Jig!!!
  8772: Shining Summer Samba!!!
  8773: Lovely Miracle Waltz!!!
  8774: |-
    Urgh...
    It's my turrrn, now!
  8775: Ouchies!
  8776: Please, I need your help!
  8777: Uka...why? Why don't you remember me?
  8778: Mumor!
  8779: |-
    Mwahahaha!
    And so ends the story of the Mighty Maidens--not with a bang, but a whimper!
  8780: Never shall any in this land know fun again!
  8781: Noooooo...!
  8782: And so it came to pass that Mumor was vanquished by her archnemesis and an unending doldrum blanketed land and sea alike.
  8783: The only way this most terrible of fates can be reversed is by lending Mumor strength and spirit, that she may rise once more!
  8784: M-Mumor? What...happened?
  8785: Impossible!
  8786: Uka! You had the butterflies doing laps around my stomach!
  8787: Curse you, Mumor! I would have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for you meddling spectators!
  8788: But don't rest on your laurels just yet!
  8789: He's...he's a person!?
  8790: Countless eons have I flitted from star to star, bringing to each the sweet embrace of boredom.
  8791: But this clamorous world you call Vana'diel refuses to receive my gift.
  8792: Fine. I can still wrap this world in lethargy and ennui, and neither you, Diva, or Uka can stop me!
  8793: No! As long as there are light and smiles in this world, I will rise up to stop you!
  8794: That's our cue, everyone--Firesday Night Fever time!
  8795: Pardon me for breaking the fourth wall, but perhaps an explanation is in order.
  8796: Firesday Night Fever describes the special moments in a songstress's career when she is so intimately connected to her fan base that she can activate her “Dancing Force” without the need of any outward shows of support!
  8797: Hmph. You two are pathetic.
  8798: Goodbye, Ullegore, you've had a nice run!♪
  8799: But the Maidens are here, bringing Vana'diel fun!♪
  8800: The time has arrived to give the dark lord his due!♪
  8801: 'And so, evil spirits, I have this to say: pooh-pooh!♪'
  8802: Wh-what is the meaning of--!
  8803: Now's our chance, Mumor!
  8804: To see the inverted rainbow of your smile...
  8805: We'll dance to the abyss and back!
  8806: Mighty Maidens Mumor and Uka!
  8807: Eternal Vana Illusion!!!
  8808: Graaaaaaaaah!!!
  8809: We surrre gave him his comeuppance!
  8810: H-how could I...?
  8811: Wow, you're way worse at winning than I am!
  8812: You want me to leave your precious festival alone? Fine. I acquiesce.
  8813: Really? 'Cause if you break your promise, it'll be a thousand pricklies for you.
  8814: One thousand, ten thousand...bah, who can keep count?
  8815: C'mon, Mumor! Give him ten thousand right in the kisser!
  8816: Listen, guys! He hasn't broken his promise yet!
  8817: You are a curious one, Mumor. Most would relish in their victory and rub the loser's nose in it...but not you.
  8818: Though I have lost, I do not feel any ill will. Is this what “fun” is?
  8819: Okay, everyone! We've brought peace and happiness back to Vana'diel, so now it's time... I'm finally going to sing!
  8820: M-M-Mumor! D-d-don't!
  8821: Tra laaa laaaaaa...※★△✕▽!!!
  8822: Hm? Why isn't everyone cheering?
  8823: M-Mumor...I told you...not to...
  8824: This whole time...you were tone-deaf...
  8825: No...my number-one nemesis...all along was...some squawking sham!?
  8826: Oh come now, everyone! You're giving me a bad case of the uglies!
  8827: My darling festivalgoers, you brought a spring back to Uka's step and a tear to my eye! I love you...each and every one of you!
  8828: Why, without you, Ullegore would be running rampant across the land!
  8829: Next time I'll have a super-sweet melody prepared, so keep those ears open and wait with bated breath!

  8877: Like any good diva, Mumor requires the cheers of her fans to unlock her true potential in the struggles that lie ahead. In short, your emotions are her strength.${prompt}
  8878: /clapping, /cheering, and /waving all have a positive effect on her, and switching between them has a greater effect than repeating the same one over and over.${prompt}
  8879: When Mumor has received enough accolades from her fans, she will unleash one of her powerful dance moves. When she does, dance along with her!${prompt}
  8880: Her dances include the following:${prompt}
  8881: |-
    Shining Summer Samba:
    /dance1
    Lovely Miracle Waltz:
    /dance2${prompt}
  8882: |-
    Neo Crystal Jig:
    /dance3
    Super Crusher Jig:
    /dance4${prompt}
  8883: That should cover it.${prompt}
  8884: Dancing the proper steps in sync with Mumor will strengthen the bond between the two of you.${prompt}
  8885: So unite as one to give Mumor the energy she so desperately needs!${prompt}
  8886: We will also be selling a variety of festival goods throughout the event. The more you buy, the happier Mumor becomes, so do your idol proud!${prompt}
  8887: That does it for the explanation of our event. I hope you enjoy the show!${prompt}

    What has brought you to our fine guild today, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madame]?
    Wait... That scroll! Would you mind if I had a closer look?${prompt}
  8889: The craftsmanship is so beautiful...yet so familiar...${prompt}
  8890: |-
    Hm...
    While there is no sign of the original goldsmith's signature, I think I may know who originally crafted this fine piece.${prompt}
  8891: Here, have a look at this diary. Beautiful, isn't it?${prompt}
  8892: Can you see the similarities in the book's jade lock and the scroll's decorated fastener?${prompt}
  8893: But that's not all. The handwriting in both the diary and the scroll are the same... Look here, I've found a name...${prompt}
  8894: |-
    Albanus.
    Let us see what our craftsman had to say...${prompt}
  8895: |-
    “Symmetrical, yet elegant design...
    Intricate, yet delicate craftsmanship...”${prompt}
  8896: And an alloy with the 'voice' of an angel.${prompt}
  8897: Only when these three hurdles are cleared will the perfect bell be born.${prompt}
  8898: Ah, but just thinking of the day I finally reach my goal ties my stomach in knots.${prompt}
  8899: There is still so much I must learn before I am able to step out on my own. I must continue to concentrate on the road that lies ahead.${prompt}
  8900: However, my studies keep me so busy, I have not even finished cleaning out the small room the guildmaster was kind enough to lend me. Though I do not know how much longer I can stand sleeping amongst rusty buckets and moldy cobwebs.${prompt}
  8901: And so on and so on...${prompt}
  8902: If you ask me, this young fellow seems a little too high-strung. While I have nothing against studying hard to improve one's skills, state of mind has a lot to do with how a work turns out.${prompt}
  8903: A great painter once said art is ninety percent inspiration and ten percent perspiration--meaning the more you perspire, the more sweat you get on your painting... And no one likes a sweaty picture.${prompt}
  8904: Are you following me?${prompt}
  8905: Anyway, you said you were looking for clues to repair a damaged bell. While I have not had much experience building such large objects, I do know someone who does.${prompt}
  8906: You have been to the Blacksmiths' Guild in San d'Oria, haven't you? Well, did you know that the guildmaster there forged the bells that hang in the San d'Orian Cathedral?${prompt}
  8907: Now, whether or not he will help you, I cannot say.${prompt}
  8908: Those Elvaan are a stubborn lot, and old Mevreauche is the worst I know.${prompt}
  8909: Hopefully you can catch him on one of his good days, if he has any...${prompt}
  8910: |-
    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Vicious villains are venting violently outside the city walls, kupo!${prompt}
  8911: We've divined that these creatures are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt}
  8912: |-
    But never fear!
    Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these invaders!
    Behold the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo!${prompt}
  8913: The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt}
  8914: But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!${prompt}
  8915: |-
    Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.
    Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt}
  8916: 'The ${item-singular: 0[2]} will absorb a part of the villain''s aura every time you attack, kupo.${prompt}'
  8917: Even if you don't topple the terror, bring the weapon to a moogle and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!${prompt}
  8918: |-
    By the way, these monsters are running around in samurai-style armor.
    They may be hiding among other adventurers, so be on your guard, kupo!${prompt}
  8919: |-
    Here's a new ${item-singular: 0[2]}.
    Bring it back to a moogle if you deal any damage to those samurai-styled scoundrels, kupo!${prompt}
  8920: 'If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt}'
  8921: Bring the weapon to a moogle after you've inflicted some damage to the marauding monsters and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!${prompt}
  8922: |-
    I can see the aura you've absorbed from the enemy!
    Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt}
  8923: |-
    With all the aura you've absorbed with the ${item-plural: 0[2]}, we've managed to create a new weapon.
    We'd like you to have it, kupo!${prompt}
  8924: Have you ever heard of Blitz Buffalo, kupo? It's a fast and frenzied buffalo-chasing fiasco ferried in from a land to the far west of Quon!${prompt}
  8925: We moogles thought it sounded like fun! So we rounded up a bunch of buffalos and set them loose in several places, kupo!${prompt}
  8926: Also, we've tied an item to each buffalo! Anyone who catches one can keep the item as a reward! It's a great opportunity for adventurers, kupo!${prompt}
  8927: But the buffalos aren't going to take a bunch of frantic adventurers chasing them lightly! You may have to knock one out before it yields its precious item, kupo!${prompt}
  8928: If you manage to lay your hands on a buffalo, you better prepare to be flung around, kupo... Kupohoho～.${prompt}
  8929: |-
    Of course, it wouldn't be too good if you ended up being the one chased either, kupo!
    Just take care, and good luck, kupo!${prompt}
  8930: It's time once again for the Starlight Celebration!${prompt}
  8931: We moogles have collected piles and piles of presents for the adventurers this time, kupo!${prompt}
  8932: We'd like to give them to each person individually, but everyone always seems to be off on some adventure or another, and we can't keep them all straight! Could you help us, kupo?${prompt}
  8933: Give this card to an adventurer and tell him or her to bring it to a moogle. We'll have a present waiting, kupo!${prompt}
  8934: There are four cards in all. Once you hand the first card out, I will ask the adventurer who brings it back to help with the next.${prompt}
  8935: You'll help us out, kupo?${prompt}
  8936: |-
    Help the moogles?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'll give it a try.
    I have other things to do.${prompt}
  8937: Oh, I just remembered! I think that the cards are all addressed to people who are wearing red...${prompt}
  8938: Good luck!${prompt}
  8939: If you change your mind, just let me know, kupo.${prompt}
  8940: 'This card is addressed to a ${choice: 1}[warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the ${number: 2}s, kupo!${prompt}'

  8942: |-
    I've been waiting!
    I've got a present for you, kupo!${prompt}
  8943: I have a request, too. I've got presents for all the other adventurers, too, but I can't find everyone. I need your help, kupo!${prompt}
  8944: 'I need you to give this card to a ${choice: 1}[warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the ${number: 2}s, and have them bring it back to me, kupo!${prompt}'
  8945: Oh, and the person should be wearing the same red clothing you are!${prompt}
  8946: I'll wait here and get the present ready! Thanks, kupo!${prompt}
  8947: 'Did you hand out the ${item-singular: 0[2]} yet, kupo? If you forgot who to give it to, just bring it to a moogle and you''ll get a reminder.${prompt}'
  8948: |-
    You forgot who to give the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to?
    Find a ${choice: 1}[warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the ${number: 2}s and hand it over, kupo!${prompt}
  8949: You can only hand out one card a day, kupo!${prompt}
  8950: What in blazes could he be doing? He shoulda been here by now! No reason to wait! I don't bite!${prompt}
  8951: It's about time you brought my painting! Show it to me!${prompt}
  8952: Oh, but what's the hurry? I've just arrived. Don't you want to sit back and relax a spell first? Take a deep breath, stretch out, maybe grab a few sips of tea...${prompt}
  8953: I don't know what kinda inane ideas they're feeding you young'uns today, but when I order a painting, I expect it to come on time, not three days late!${prompt}
  8954: Or maybe you just don't have it! If that's the case...just let me crack my knuckles first...${prompt}
  8955: |-
    Okay! Okay!
    Here, I'll give it to you, so calm down. It goes without saying that you'll take good care of it, right?${prompt}
  8956: Ouais, peu importe. Dépêchez-vous de me le donner ! Les jeunes d'aujourd'hui, sans respect.${prompt}
  8957: Hein ? C'est un emballage assez sécurisé... Je ne peux pas l'ouvrir, tu m'entends !?${prompt}
  8958: Oh non non non non non ! Tu ne dois pas bouger avec tant de vigueur ! Que dirais-tu de prendre une grande inspiration d'abord, et puis on en parle, d'accord ?${prompt}
  8959: Tu veux dire que la peinture n'est pas encore sèche ?${prompt}
  8960: Après m'avoir fait attendre trois jours, tu me livres un produit inachevé ! Petit... ! Quoi, tu penses que nous, les vieux, on passe notre temps à tricoter, en espérant que tu nous consacres du temps un jour !?${prompt}
  8961: Monsieur, je vous assure, cette peinture est un chef-d'œuvre délicat. Ce serait une catastrophe de la déranger avant qu'elle ne soit complètement sèche ! L'humidité et la température doivent être parfaites pour garantir une qualité maximale !${prompt}
  8962: C'est ce que dit ici ${name-player}, et ${choice-player-gender}[sa parole est fiable. Pourquoi, ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] est un artiste professionnel ${choice-player-gender}[lui-même/elle-même] !${prompt}
  8963: ${choice-player-gender}[Il/Elle] ressemble à un aventurier ? Ha, tu me fais marcher ! Je veux dire, si on le regarde d'une certaine manière, ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] pourrait ressembler à un vrai... c'est-à-dire, ne juge pas sur les apparences !${prompt}
  8964: Bref, notre expert ici dit que d'ouvrir la boîte maintenant aurait un effet négatif sur la peinture.${prompt}
  8965: Vous devez être patient jusqu'à ce que ${name-player} donne le feu vert !${prompt}
  8966: Vous ne voudriez pas que votre impatience ruine cette belle peinture, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8967: Eh bien, je suppose que je n'ai pas le choix maintenant, n'est-ce pas ? Puisque j'ai déjà attendu trois jours, je suppose que je peux attendre un peu plus. Je laisserai passer cette fois. Mais ne pensez pas vous en sortir indemne.${prompt}
  8968: Tant que ça sèche, vous allez m'aider.${prompt}
  8969: 'L''autre jour, j''ai perdu mon ${item-singular: 0[2]}. C''est un souvenir de ma défunte femme, voyez-vous.${prompt}'
  8970: Vous allez en chercher un autre. Vous ne refuseriez pas un vieux monsieur gentil, n'est-ce pas !?${prompt}
  8971: Oh, allez !${prompt}
  8972: D'abord, vous me faites attendre dans l'angoisse, et ensuite vous n'écoutez même pas une seule supplique pour le souvenir de ma pauvre femme décédée ! Quel genre de monstre êtes-vous ? Je ne fais pas affaire avec des monstres !${prompt}
  8973: A-attends ! Tu penses vraiment qu'on ne ferait pas une ou deux faveurs pour un client estimé comme toi ? Comment pourrait-il penser que tu ne l'aiderais pas, ${name-player} ?${prompt}
  8974: Promets-moi juste de ne pas ouvrir cette boîte. ${name-player} a dit de ne pas le faire !${prompt}
  8975: Ouais ouais, tais-toi. Allez, va !${prompt}
  8976: D'accord ! On l'a vraiment bien dupé. Étape un, terminé !${prompt}
  8977: Même lui n'oserait pas ouvrir cette boîte après tout ce qu'on lui a dit !${prompt}
  8978: Maintenant, tout ce qu'on peut faire est d'espérer que ton ami s'en sort aussi bien avec Angelica...${prompt}
  8979: Qu'est-ce que c'est que ce bruit ?${prompt}
  8980: Vous pouvez communiquer avec votre partenaire à travers ça ? C'est fantastique ! Alors, comment ça se passe à Windurst ?${prompt}
  8981: Elle refera la peinture !? Génial ! Tu as vraiment un bon ami, je dirais ! Eh bien, il ne nous reste plus qu'à faire de notre mieux pour gagner du temps maintenant !${prompt}
  8982: J'aurais juste aimé que ce vieux ne demande pas quelque chose d'aussi bizarre.${prompt}
  8983: 'Il voulait un ${item-singular: 0[2]}, c''est ça ?${prompt}'
  8984: Je les avais en stock il y a un moment. Mon fournisseur disait qu'il les obtenait dans le Tunnel de Korroloka.${prompt}
  8985: Je déteste le dire, mais j'ai un rendez-vous qui m'attend à Selbina.${prompt}
  8986: 'Alors je vais te laisser la recherche du ${item-singular: 0[2]} !${prompt}'
  8987: 'Hé hé, ne me regarde pas comme ça, maintenant. Tu es le seul sur qui je peux compter ! S''il te plaît, trouve le ${item-singular: 0[2]} pour moi !${prompt}'
  8988: 'C''était un tel choc, de perdre le ${item-singular: 0[2]} que ma pauvre femme gardait quand elle était en vie...${prompt}'
  8989: S'il te plaît, trouve-le pour moi, jeune !${prompt}
  8990: |-
    C-ceci est... !
    Vous avez vraiment trouvé le ${item-singular: 0[2]} !${prompt}
  8991: Je suis tellement heureux. J'ai attendu ce moment si longtemps !${prompt}
  8992: La peinture que j'ai commandée est en fait un portrait de ma pauvre femme décédée.${prompt}
  8993: C'était une fine demoiselle, vraiment. Bien trop bien pour un homme comme moi.${prompt}
  8994: 'Il y a longtemps, je lui ai donné le ${item-singular: 0[2]} que vous avez trouvé pour moi.${prompt}'
  8995: 'Ces temps sont révolus depuis longtemps, mais elle et moi allions à la plage pour chasser des ${item-plural: 0[2]} ensemble.${prompt}'
  8996: Je lui ai donné un joli sans trop y penser, simplement parce que je trouvais qu'il était beau. Mais elle était si heureuse qu'elle en a fait un pendentif, disant qu'elle voulait le garder pour toujours.${prompt}
  8997: Elle le portait tous les jours jusqu'à sa mort...${prompt}
  8998: 'J''ai toujours pensé que je voulais lui offrir quelque chose de plus beau, mais elle insistait que le ${item-singular: 0[2]} était le cadeau parfait.${prompt}'
  8999: C'était le premier et le dernier cadeau que je lui ai jamais fait.${prompt}
  9000: Ma femme était une artiste. Elle aimait tellement peindre qu'elle emportait sa toile partout avec elle.${prompt}
  9001: Elle m'utilisait souvent comme modèle pour ses œuvres. J'étais gêné et j'essayais toujours de refuser, mais elle était tenace.${prompt}
  9002: Elle mettait toujours beaucoup l'accent sur la couleur. Elle voyageait dans le monde entier à la recherche de peintures appropriées.${prompt}
  9003: 'La teinte dont elle était le plus fière de recréer était la couleur du ${item-singular: 0[2]} que je lui avais donné. Les couleurs changent avec différents degrés de lumière, vous savez, et peuvent être difficiles à reproduire.${prompt}'
  9004: Elle chérissait grandement sa “recette secrète”.${prompt}
  9005: C'est incroyable comme une maison peut devenir si solitaire avec la perte d'une seule personne.${prompt}
  9006: Avant que mes souvenirs ne commencent à s'estomper, je veux rassembler tout ce que je me souviens de ma femme.${prompt}
  9007: C'est pourquoi j'ai commandé son portrait.${prompt}
  9008: Ah, j'en ai trop dit.${prompt}
  9009: Pourriez-vous... me laisser seul un moment ?${prompt}
  9010: Tu as réussi à le faire parler, ce vieux grincheux ? On dirait qu'il aimait vraiment sa femme.${prompt}
  9011: Maintenant, je ne peux vraiment pas lui dire que j'ai perdu son portrait ! Je me demande comment avance la refonte...${prompt}
  9012: Hm, on dirait que ça prendra du temps, hein ? Eh bien, c'est dommage.${prompt}
  9013: Je viens de recevoir un message de Selbina, et je dois y retourner pour traiter une affaire importante.${prompt}
  9014: Il est probablement préférable que vous laissiez le vieil homme tranquille pendant un moment.${prompt}
  9015: Bref, je vais y aller maintenant. Rejoignez-moi à Selbina quand vous aurez terminé ici.${prompt}
  9016: Désolé, mais pourriez-vous me laisser tranquille pendant un moment ?${prompt}
  9017: Vous êtes tous les deux en sécurité ! Vous m'avez fait peur !${prompt}
  9018: Peut-être que vous l'avez déjà entendu, mais j'ai trouvé la peinture originale. Je viens de la livrer au vieil homme.${prompt}
  9019: Bon sang, c'est dur de faire les choses tout seul ! Il m'a surpris en train de tenter de faire entrer la peinture avant même que j'aie eu le temps de cligner des yeux.${prompt}
  9020: Qu'est-ce que tu pensais faire, essayer de tromper un pauvre vieux ? Tu ne peux pas t'en empêcher parce que tu as été attaqué par de méchants pirates ? Ne sois pas surpris si tu te retrouves dans de beaux draps, et très bientôt !${prompt}
  9021: Toi, cependant, tu as toute ma gratitude. C'est toi qui es allé chercher mon souvenir, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9022: Je ne pensais pas que tu le ferais vraiment. Désolé pour tous ces tracas.${prompt}
  9023: Regarder cela me rappelle la vie heureuse que j'ai eue avec ma femme.${prompt}
  9024: J'ai fermé mon cœur quand elle est morte.${prompt}
  9025: J'ai construit un mur autour de moi, pensant que personne ne pouvait comprendre ma douleur.${prompt}
  9026: Bien sûr, en conséquence, les gens ont arrêté de venir me voir...${prompt}
  9027: Mais je ne voulais pas vraiment être seul.${prompt}
  9028: J'aspirais à une sorte de vestige de ma femme, alors j'ai commandé son portrait.${prompt}
  9029: Cela m'a juste fait réaliser à quel point elle est importante dans ma vie.${prompt}
  9030: Elle a toujours été là, me soutenant quand j'en avais besoin.${prompt}
  9031: Je n'ai pas besoin de la peinture.${prompt}
  9032: Elle ne peut pas reposer en paix tant que je cours encore après son souvenir.${prompt}
  9033: Merci. C'était dangereux là-bas, n'est-ce pas ? Désolé pour tout.${prompt}
  9034: Cette photo... ! C'est... c'est ma femme, en chair et en os !${prompt}
  9035: Et cette coloration ! La "recette secrète" de ma femme !${prompt}
  9036: C'est exactement ce que je cherchais ! S'il vous plaît, donnez-moi ce portrait ! Je vous en prie !${prompt}
  9037: Bien sûr. ${name-player} et moi avons travaillé dur pour vous l'obtenir, après tout.${prompt}
  9038: Prenez-le ! ${name-player} et moi avons peiné pour vous l'apporter !${prompt}
  9039: Il est à vous. C'est ce pour quoi ${name-player} et moi avons travaillé, après tout.${prompt}
  9040: ${name-player} et moi l'avons toujours destiné pour vous. Il vous appartient.${prompt}
  9041: Bien sûr ! C'est pourquoi ${name-player} et moi l'avons apporté ici !${prompt}
  9042: Hé, pas besoin de supplier. ${name-player} et moi avions l'intention de vous le donner.${prompt}
  9043: Bien sûr. ${name-player} et moi avons travaillé dur pour vous l'apporter.${prompt}
  9044: Oui, bien sûr ! ${name-player} et moi l'avons obtenu pour vous, après tout !${prompt}
  9045: Il est à vous. ${name-player} et moi l'avions destiné pour vous depuis le début, de toute façon.${prompt}
  9046: Oui, bien sûr ! ${name-player} et moi avons tellement travaillé pour vous l'obtenir !${prompt}
  9047: ${name-player} et moi l'avons toujours destiné pour vous. Il vous appartient.${prompt} 
  9048: Ce portrait n'est pas à ${name-player} et moi de le donner. Il vous appartient.${prompt}
  9049: L'important, c'est que vous soyez heureux, de toute façon.${prompt}
  9050: |-
    Vraiment !?
    C'est comme un rêve !${prompt}
  9051: Ah, je suppose que je ne devrais pas m'exciter autant. Mauvais pour le cœur, dit-on.${prompt}
  9052: Après la mort de ma femme, beaucoup de gens se sont tournés vers moi. Je me demande comment vont ces personnes maintenant...${prompt}
  9053: Peut-être devrais-je même m'excuser pour mon attitude à ce moment-là...${prompt}
  9054: Avec cette peinture, vous m'avez aidé à réaliser ce que je manque vraiment.${prompt}
  9055: Merci pour tout.${prompt}
  9056: Ma femme m'a laissé beaucoup de choses, tangibles et autres...${prompt}
  9057: Je n'oublierai jamais le temps que nous avons passé ensemble.${prompt}
  9058: Vous avez perdu ma peinture ? C'est, comme, vraiment pas cool, tu sais.${prompt}
  9059: Est-ce que ça pourrait être celle que ce gars, Umberto ou quoi que ce soit, voulait ?${prompt}
  9060: Bref, crache le morceau, d'accord ?${prompt}
  9061: Oh, ma Déesse ! Attaqué par des pirates ? C'est, comme, terriblement terrifiant !${prompt}
  9062: Et la peinture a été perdue dans toute cette confusion, hein ?${prompt}
  9063: Et tu es venu ici à la demande de quelqu'un nommé Diederik pour me demander de la refaire ?${prompt}
  9064: Et il amène, comme, une boîte vide au grincheux à la place ?${prompt}
  9065: Waouh, c'est, comme, super audacieux ! Je me demande s'il peut y arriver !${prompt}
  9066: Bref, je comprends totalement ta situation maintenant. Je vais refaire la peinture.${prompt}
  9067: C'est un test de ma brillance en tant que peintre. J'accepte !${prompt}
  9068: Maintenant que j'y pense, l'original était de la nourriture pour chocobos de toute façon. Je peux, comme, faire bien mieux que ça !${prompt}
  9069: Donc, il voulait que je peigne sa femme décédée ou quelque chose comme ça, hein ? Diederik m'a donné un portrait de référence, mais...${prompt}
  9070: '...C''est complètement faux ! Il n''y a, comme, aucune féminité dedans du tout !${prompt}'
  9071: C'est si nul ! Il doit y avoir autre chose, tu sais ?${prompt}
  9072: Waouh, j'ai vraiment entendu un son !${prompt}
  9073: Tu peux parler à ton ami de cette manière ? C'est super cool !${prompt}
  9074: Alors, as-tu eu des détails sur comment je devrais peindre mon prochain chef-d'œuvre ?${prompt}
  9075: |-
    Donc, il avait cet objet ${item-singular: 0[2]} comme souvenir d'elle ?
    ...Oh, ça vient ! Je suis, comme, en train de recevoir une image !${prompt}
  9076: 'Oh, ohhh... Vite, va au Tunnel de Korroloka et rapporte-moi ce ${item-singular: 0[2]} pour que je puisse peindre avant de perdre l''image !${prompt}'
  9077: 'Le ${item-singular: 0[2]} ! C''est le souvenir de sa femme pour le vieux, hein ?${prompt}'
  9078: Oh, ohhh... Je reçois quelque chose ! Je reçois cette image vague et floue !${prompt}
  9079: Hé, j'ai déjà vu ça !${prompt}
  9080: Ouais, c'était totalement à Bastok !${prompt}
  9081: 'J''étais à Bastok, et tout, et il y avait cette dame qui portait ce ${item-singular: 0[2]} comme un pendentif, ou quelque chose du genre.${prompt}'
  9082: Elle était peintre, et elle peignait des portraits de son mari chaque fois qu'ils avaient un jour de congé.${prompt}
  9083: C''était le bonheur conjugal total. Son mec était un petit gars un peu rebelle, mais elle était totalement, comme, détendue et tout. Je pense qu'elle l'apaisait.${prompt}

  9251: I hope you enjoy the event together, kupo! When both of you are ready, just talk to one of us moogles to start!${prompt}
  9252: I'll be waiting here, so just let me know when you're prepared, kupo.${prompt}
  9253: |-
    Kupopo! Congratulations!
    You were wonderful together! This is all yours now, kupo...${prompt}
  9254: Kupo? This isn't your partner's item! Trade with your partner first, and give their item to me!${prompt}
  9255: We're just waiting on your partner now, kupo! Or would you like to cancel your participation?${prompt}
  9256: Your partner isn't ready yet, kupo. I'll wait, though.${prompt}
  9257: It looks like your partner doesn't want to go yet. Just let me know when your partner is ready, kupo.${prompt}
  9258: Are you ready now, kupo?${prompt}
  9259: |-
    Leave town?
    ${selection-lines}
    Send me out!
    Not yet...${prompt}
  9260: Oh, you're both wearing yukata! You must be ready for a real challenge, kupo! Don't worry, though--the prize is worth it!${prompt}
  9261: Kupo? That's not the partner you were with before! Changing partners in the middle of the game is against the rules, kupo.${prompt}
  9262: If you want to play with a different person, you should talk to one of us moogles and start the game over!${prompt}
  9263: I can only give each person one item a day!${prompt}
  9264: Later, I'll check to make sure you both found your checkpoints. I'll also give you this gate glyph so you can return to town, kupo!${prompt}
  9265: 'Kupo? You already have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  9266: Kupo! I almost forgot the most important thing of all! Here, take this!${prompt}
  9267: '${color-alt: 15}The moogle hands ${name-player} a small compass made from scintillant ore.'
  9268: If you both manage to find your checkpoints, I'll give you a reward... So do your best, kupo! ${prompt}
  9269: What? You found a doll, kupo? Then trade it with your partner and give it to one of us moogles!${prompt}
  9270: Sorry, but if you don't reach the checkpoint yourself, I can't give out a reward, kupo...${prompt}
  9271: Looks like you weren't successful... Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt}
  9272: Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt}
  9273: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player} returns the compass to the moogle.'
  9274: You know what to do now--get right back on your feet and try again! Just let me know if you're feeling up for it, kupo.${prompt}
  9275: What is it? Do you want to start over?${prompt}
  9276: |-
    Start over?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, please.
    No thanks.${prompt}
  9277: |-
    You there.
    I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of ghosts?${prompt}
  9278: |-
    Have you heard?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ghosts!?
    Yes, I've heard.${prompt}
  9279: Then we may move on to more important matters.${prompt}
  9280: Would you be willing to aid me in exorcising these spirits?${prompt}
  9281: |-
    <Sigh>...
    Allow me to explain.
    I am an exorcist--a banisher of spirits.${prompt}
  9282: I have traveled here at the behest of a certain personage from this nation who is well aware of my skill in such matters.${prompt}
  9283: The request is fairly routine--I am to banish the spirits that have suddenly appeared within the town. But there is a problem...${prompt}
  9284: These ghosts are not simple apparitions.${prompt}
  9285: When they yet lived, they belonged to a witch coven known as the Dark Lilies.${prompt}
  9286: And they use the language of spirits--the Cursed Tongue. It is not a language I am familiar with.${prompt}
  9287: |-
    The art of the exorcist involves learning the mind of the spirit in order to bring it under control.
    I am at the point of capitulation.${prompt}
  9288: That is why I am calling on adventurers to aid me.${prompt}
  9289: I want you to disguise yourself as a monster, and try to eavesdrop on the spirit's mumblings.${prompt}
  9290: Once I learn of these ravings, I will be able to carry out my role as an exorcist.${prompt}
  9291: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt}
  9292: |-
    Ahaha...
    How droll.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  9293: |-
    Most excellent.
    There is one thing you must be aware of, however.${prompt}
  9294: These spirits were once people such as you and I. If they see you directly, there is a good chance they will see through your disguise.${prompt}
  9295: If, by chance, your disguise fails you, simply assume a monstrous form once again and continue your pursuit.${prompt}
  9296: I am aware of two spirits that haunt this town.${prompt}
  9297: The one known as Guwanana is the most alert and suspicious, so I will ask you to first track down the Mithran spirit by the name of Bikho Ronpotteh.${prompt}
  9298: Once you have a clear idea of why the ghost has appeared here, I want you to report your findings to me immediately.${prompt}
  9299: Good luck.${prompt}
  9300: |-
    Is that the glow of success I see upon your face?
    What of the spirit...?${prompt}
  9301: |-
    I see...
    So that is her purpose...${prompt}
  9302: The tale is tragic, but this world is no longer meant for one such as she.${prompt}
  9303: I will prepare for the exorcism.${prompt}
  9304: |-
    You have been a great help.
    Please take this as a token of my appreciation.${prompt}
  9305: |-
    This is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies.
    Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities.
    Enjoy yourself, and forget about this sorrowful affair.${prompt}
  9306: However, should you wish to aid in another exorcism, I would welcome your help.${prompt}
  9307: |-
    What has befallen you?
    Do you wish to give up?${prompt}
  9308: |-
    Give up?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm done.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  9309: |-
    A pity.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  9310: Then please return to your pursuit of the spirits.${prompt}
  9311: |-
    Ah, you're back!
    Perhaps you have enough experience now to stalk the more alert ghost of the two.${prompt}
  9312: Will you consent to aid me again?${prompt}
  9313: |-
    The second spirit is called Guwanana.
    She is well aware of her surroundings, so I urge the utmost care when following her.${prompt}
  9314: |-
    Good day!
    I suppose you've heard of all the ghost sightings around town?${prompt}
  9315: I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.${prompt}
  9316: |-
    I'll get straight to the point.
    Do you want to help in an exorcism?${prompt}
  9317: |-
    Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess.
    Let me give you the short version:${prompt}
  9318: I'm a stranger to this land, called in by one of those important types.${prompt}
  9319: |-
    For what?
    I happen to have a certain level of fame as an exorcist.
    You know--a banisher of spirits.${prompt}
  9320: But these spirits are proving to be a bit of a handful.${prompt}
  9321: They were powerful witches in life and used to belong to some famous coven.${prompt}
  9322: |-
    The worst thing is, they use some beastly language known as the “Cursed Tongue.”
    That's not a language I can understand.${prompt}
  9323: |-
    That's a problem because, as an exorcist, I need to learn what's in their hearts and minds.
    Then I can find a weakness.${prompt}
  9324: That's where you come in...${prompt}
  9325: I need you to disguise yourself as a monster and get close enough to find out what they're thinking.${prompt}
  9326: Once I know some details, I can begin the exorcism and rid this town of its unwelcome guests.${prompt}
  9327: |-
    What do you say?
    Will you help?${prompt}
  9328: |-
    Oh...
    Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  9329: |-
    Thank you!
    There is one thing you should know...${prompt}
  9330: |-
    These ghosts are a little vague, but they were once people too.
    If they get a good look at you, they'll know you're just wearing a costume...${prompt}
  9331: |-
    But don't give up if they catch on to you.
    Just put the disguise back on and try again.${prompt}
  9332: I've located two spirits floating around this town.${prompt}
  9333: |-
    The first one, Pretty Heart, is fairly sharp.
    I suggest you go after Selma, the second spirit, to get your feet wet.${prompt}
  9334: Once you've figured out why the ghost is here, you need to tell me about it right away.${prompt}
  9335: Good luck!${prompt}
  9336: Oho, looks like you've managed to learn something...${prompt}
  9337: |-
    Hmmm...
    So that's why...${prompt}
  9338: |-
    It might seem cruel, but that ghost no longer belongs here.
    The exorcism is for their sake as much as ours...${prompt}
  9339: It's time to begin my preparation.${prompt}
  9340: Oh, and this is for you.${prompt}
  9341: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    The design matches those worn by the coven I mentioned.
    Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.${prompt}
  9342: If you want to try your hand at ghost-chasing again, I'll be right here.${prompt}
  9343: Giving up the ghost?${prompt}
  9344: |-
    Oh...
    Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  9345: Then it's back to chasing spirits with you!${prompt}
  9346: |-
    You know what?
    I think you could probably track that other ghost now that you have some experience.${prompt}
  9347: What do you think?${prompt}
  9348: |-
    Your target's name is Pretty Heart.
    Wonder why he's called that...${prompt}
  9349: |-
    Really?
    I'm pretty sure you've got it in you...${prompt}
  9350: |-
    Hi, I'm Gertrude.
    I came to investigate the rumors of ghosts haunting this town.
    Have you heard anything?${prompt}
  9351: |-
    You have?
    Well, that makes my job easier, then.${prompt}
  9352: Do you think you could help out a struggling exorcist?${prompt}
  9353: |-
    No?
    Then let me fill you in on the details.${prompt}
  9354: I may not appear as such, but I'm actually an exorcist from a land far to the west.${prompt}
  9355: A certain personage from this nation summoned me to banish the spirits plaguing the city.${prompt}
  9356: But once I arrived, I discovered these ghosts were not your average apparitions.${prompt}
  9357: In life, they were fearsome witches and wielded destructive spells of tremendous power.${prompt}
  9358: Their strength has followed them into the afterlife, giving them a high level of resistance to my exorcisms.${prompt}
  9359: In this sort of case, I would usually find some clue from their former lives in order to empower my rituals.${prompt}
  9360: The problem is, these spirits speak the Cursed Tongue, and I can't understand enough of that language to learn anything.${prompt}
  9361: And so, I'm forced to call upon adventurers to aid me.${prompt}
  9362: Would you be willing to disguise yourself as a monster and try to discover what drives these beings?${prompt}
  9363: |-
    Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard.
    Please come back if you change your mind.${prompt}
  9364: |-
    Wonderful.
    There is one thing I must warn you of, however.${prompt}
  9365: These witches were once people, and are clever enough to see through your disguise should you be too careless.${prompt}
  9366: |-
    If they do happen to find you out, please don't give up.
    They will soon forget, and you can don your costume once again.${prompt}
  9367: According to my sources, there are two ghosts in this area.${prompt}
  9368: |-
    The one called Maryse is extremely vigilant and aware of her surroundings.
    I suggest you try following Poseaulloie first to get some practice.${prompt}
  9369: |-
    Once you've discovered the ghost's reason for remaining in this world, please inform me at once.
    There are many preparations to be made.${prompt}
  9370: Good luck!${prompt}
  9371: How did you fare...?${prompt}
  9372: I see, so that's why she...${prompt}
  9373: However, it is my duty to give her that little push she needs to leave this world behind.${prompt}
  9374: I will begin preparing for the exorcism.${prompt}
  9375: |-
    Your help has been invaluable.
    Would you accept this in appreciation?${prompt}
  9376: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...${prompt}
  9377: If you have time, I would gladly accept your help again.${prompt}
  9378: |-
    What's wrong?
    Have you grown tired of your task?${prompt}
  9379: |-
    Oh, I see...
    Well, please return to me if you find your patience for this task restored.${prompt}
  9380: |-
    Then I would ask you to return to your task.
    Good luck.${prompt}
  9381: Would you consider an attempt at following the more wily of the two spirits?${prompt}
  9382: I'm sure you have sufficient experience now.${prompt}
  9383: |-
    Then your next target is the one known as Maryse.
    Please be careful...${prompt}
  9384: |-
    You must recover your strength before you continue pursuing these supernatural intruders.
    Return to me once you have had time to rest.${prompt}
  9385: |-
    I appreciate the offer of help, but you're in no state to be chasing ghosts.
    Build your strength, rest your mind, and return to me when you're ready.${prompt}
  9386: I'm happy to have someone so cooperative on my side, but too much contact with spirits will drain your strength. Return to me on the morrow when you've had time to rest.${prompt}
  9387: |-
    !!!
    You...you're no monster!${prompt}
  9388: |-
    !!!

    He passed...without ever knowing...
    But I...am still here...${prompt}
  9398: |-
    I...
    I should no longer care...
    I want to forget...${prompt}
  9399: |-
    The fountain where he took his rest...
    The stones that grew wet with his tears...
    Nothing has changed...except me...${prompt}
  9400: |-
    The moat where he swam...
    The shade where he slept...
    It is still the same...${prompt}
  9401: |-
    Ah...I know you are there...
    But to have someone hear my pain...has lightened my soul...if only a little...${prompt}
  9402: This moat...where I fell in...${prompt}
  9403: |-
    I slipped...on the bridge...
    I fell...${prompt}
  9404: |-
    He was always there...
    I didn't notice...${prompt}
  9405: |-
    From the time that I was small...
    Always there to save me...${prompt}
  9406: |-
    Even when I was loathed and feared...
    You were there to praise my power...${prompt}
  9407: My brother...${prompt}
  9408: |-
    But I...I was always angry...
    I even forgot the lunch you made...${prompt}
  9409: |-
    But here...
    I want to tell you just once...${prompt}
  9410: |-
    Thank you...
    Thank you for being there...for me...${prompt}
  9411: Your lunches...always made with so much care...${prompt}
  9412: |-
    I see you there...
    Listening to me... I should curse you...
    But I will forgive you...as my brother would...${prompt}

    These trees...
    I burned with the Fire spell...
    Yet they have grown back...${prompt}

    Then why...?
    Why do I feel so at home here...?${prompt}

    Why...?

    Children nowadays want all kinds of goodies. I'm a bit behind the times, so I'm afraid I can't offer any good advice as to what would be the best present.${prompt}
  9462: But if you want to avoid suspicion, you'll need a red hat like mine. All smilebringers have them!${prompt}

  9470: 'We have to run this monster out of town, kupo! The moogles will do all the work. All you have to do is ${color: 5}cheer${color: 1} us along!${prompt}'

    Bad tree! Bad tree!
    We won't let him get any further, kupo! Just keep ${color: 5}cheering${color: 1} us on!${prompt}
  9472: |-
    Thanks, everybody!
    Keep it up and there's no way we can lose, kupo!${prompt}
  9473: |-
    10000... 15000... 30000!
    The tree is gaining too much power! This doesn't look good, kupo!${prompt}
  9474: |-
    Unnnnnngh... Bad tree!
    We won't let you get in the way of our plans this time, kupo!${prompt}
  9475: Nnngahhh, kupo! I can't hold him back!${prompt}
  9476: The Twinkling Treant sheds a solitary tear as it fades into nothingness...${prompt}
  9477: Well, that was interesting. Who would have thought that one of our festival trees would just get up and start walking around? I'm just glad that it is all over.${prompt}
  9478: However, there is something that still bothers me... It is like a dark cloud hanging over our fair city...${prompt}
  9479: I've been so busy fighting treants and spreading love to the children, that it wasn't until recently that I heard the rumors of the “other” smilebringers...${prompt}
  9480: I don't know what these imposters are cooking up, but if they are even thinking of laying a finger on the city's innocent children...${prompt}
  9481: I hate to ask this of a stranger, but you look like someone I can trust. Would you please be so kind as to search out the false smilebringer and bring him to me so we can straighten this whole mess out?${prompt}
  9482: You're back! Were you able to find the imposter?${prompt}
  9483: You located him, but he managed to escape? Well, I guess that is better than nothing. Now that he knows we are on to him, perhaps he will cease to prey on the Kingdom's children.${prompt}
  9484: I heard from another kind adventurer that the false smilebringer was passing out strange-looking boxes to the young ones... Why, for all I know, there could be live scorpions hiding in those packages, just waiting to sting the cute little button noses of all my little friends.${prompt}
  9485: You don't know how much your kindness means to me. You're a little old to be my friend, but I'd like you to have this as a token of my appreciation.${prompt}
  9486: Wow! That was pretty frightening. I'm all for tree's rights and everything, but once those guys start walking around my town...${prompt}
  9487: Chop 'em up and toss them on the campfire, that's what I say. The only good tree is the one toasting my marshmallow.${prompt}
  9488: Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you something before you interrupted me there.${prompt}
  9489: There are these strange midgets running around town claiming that they're smilebringers just like me.${prompt}
  9490: I've had my hands so full chasing around the walking trees that I haven't been able to investigate. How about to make up for interrupting me back there, you go and see if you can find any juicy info on the fakes?${prompt}
  9491: I'll be right here protecting the fountain from any more treant attacks. Let me know the moment you've learned something worthwhile.${prompt}
  9492: |-
    Who the kewpo are you, kewpo?
    I'm nothing doing wrong here, see? I'm smilebringing to nice boys and girls, kewpo! Move along! Move along!${prompt}

    Ummm...
    I can explaining, kewpo...${prompt}
  9494: |-
    Just not today!
    Kew-pooooooooo!${prompt}
  9495: Back at last. Did you learn anything worth my partially divided attention?${prompt}
  9496: |-
    Uh-huh...
    So you let the thing get away... Well, I guess that's what I get for relying on an amateur. My bad, my bad.${prompt}
  9497: One of my other contacts told me that the little spud was passing out some strange kind of pastry to all the kids. So far I haven't heard of any diarrhea breakouts, but the day is still young.${prompt}
  9498: I guess your scaring him off will put an end to this fiasco, but we can't be one hundred percent sure. Keep your eyes out for that pest and next time don't let him escape!${prompt}
  9499: |-
    What?
    You want something for helping me out? Well, it is the Starlight Celebration. Why not? You only get what you give, right?${prompt}
  9500: Arrrg, that there walkin' tree almost stepped on me and me parrot! One step closer and I'd be makin' meself a new peg leg out of its head.${prompt}
  9501: Aye, speakin' o' peg legs, there be this mighty fishy landlubber swaggerin' 'round Windurs' posin' as a smilebringer. What's that got t' do with peg legs? Arrrg, never ye mind.${prompt}
  9502: Ye only needs t' concern yerself with the fact that this imposter is encroachin' on me territory${prompt}
  9503: Nobody, not even Davy Jones, has the right t' drop his anchor in me harbor without me express permission.${prompt}
  9504: Arrrg, ye looks like a trustworthy soul. Could ye find it in yer heart t' help out a fellow pirate in need?${prompt}
  9505: I've got a bad feelin' 'bout that tree, an' I want t' be 'round if anythin' goes awry.${prompt}
  9506: Arrrg, did ye find that scurvy dawg an' make 'im walk the plank?${prompt}
  9507: Ye say he just up an' vanished, now do ye? Well, I guess yer not t' blame.${prompt}

    But now that ye've frightened 'im off, the city should be safe.
    Here, take this bit o' plunder. Ye've earned it, matey!${prompt}

    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!${prompt}
  9511: As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt}
  9512: |-
    But never fear!
    Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]} and the marvelous ${item-singular: 1[2]}, kupo!${prompt}
  9513: The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt}
  9514: But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt}
  9515: |-
    And that's not all!
    This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!${prompt}
  9516: You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!${prompt}
  9517: 'That''s why we want you to plant (${color: 5}trade${color: 1}) your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or ${item-singular: 1[2]} into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment''s regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!${prompt}'
  9518: 'Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same ${color: 5}area${color: 1} for best results.${prompt}'
  9519: 'Alright. Here''s your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Now you''re ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt}'
  9520: Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!${prompt}
  9521: 'Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt}'
  9522: Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!${prompt}
  9523: We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!${prompt}
  9524: |-
    Th-that ${item-singular: 0[2]}...
    It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt}
  9525: 'Oh, just don''t forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} when you''ve defeated one!${prompt}'
  9526: 'You''ll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt}'
  9527: 'Oh, just don''t forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or your ${item-singular: 1[2]} when you''ve defeated one!${prompt}'
  9528: And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!${prompt}
  9529: 'No, no, no! That ${item-singular: 1[2]} is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and hurry back, kupo!${prompt}'
  9530: |-
    Well done!
    On to the next one, kupo!${prompt}
  9531: That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!${prompt}
  9532: |-
    Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo!
    If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?${prompt}
  9533: Incroyable ! Maintenant, peut-être que ces commerçants de l'Est lointain ne nous transformeront pas en viande de moogle ! Voici ta récompense, kupo !${prompt}
  9534: Je-suis sans voix ! Nous ne pensions pas que quelqu'un pouvait rivaliser avec cette menace mithra ! Voici ta récompense, kupo !${prompt}
  9535: L'ombre du voleur persiste encore dans l'armure...${prompt}
  9536: L'ombre du voleur a presque complètement disparu.${prompt}
  9537: '...${prompt}'
  9538: Dansant maintenant. Veuillez observer.${prompt}
  9539: Voudriez-vous vous joindre à la danse ?${prompt}
  9540: On dirait qu'il s'est pris d'affection pour toi !${prompt}
  9541: Ce petit gars s'appelle Valkeng. Qu'en dis-tu, Val ?${prompt}
  9542: Enchanté de rencontrer le ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/dame] aimable.${prompt}
  9543: Ha ha, n'est-il pas juste le plus mignon ?${prompt}
  9544: Mais pour tout dire, c'est seulement parce que je l'ai fait ainsi. Je ne suis pas sûr que tu l'aies remarqué, mais je contrôlais chacun de ses mouvements !${prompt}
  9545: Les “marionnettes” comme lui sont appelées des automatons. Ils peuvent faire toutes sortes de choses, mais tout dépend de la compétence du manipulateur.${prompt}
  9546: Je gagne ma vie à divertir les gens de cette façon.${prompt}
  9547: Les personnes qui peuvent contrôler et personnaliser les automatons sont appelées des “marionnettistes” dans l'Est proche.${prompt}
  9548: Tu dis que tu aimerais essayer toi-même ?${prompt}
  9549: Ha ha, j'ai bien peur que tu doives être un marionnettiste pour ça.${prompt}
  9550: Hein ? Tu veux être un marionnettiste, n'est-ce pas ? Tu es plutôt pressé, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9551: Eh bien, si j'avais le temps, je serais heureux de t'apprendre les ficelles, mais je ne peux pas gagner ma vie en restant dans la même ville pendant des mois, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9552: |-
    Ah, j’ai la solution parfaite !
    Tu devrais rencontrer mon élève, Iruki-Waraki. Je lui ai enseigné tout ce que je sais.${prompt}
  9553: Et ce n’est pas tout, il est actuellement le marionnettiste le plus acclamé de Vana’diel ! Tu devrais pouvoir le trouver en train de divertir les gens à la Porte Blanche d’Aht Urhgan avec son automate.${prompt}
  9554: Il a largement dépassé mes compétences. Tu dois vraiment voir son expertise avant d’apprendre à contrôler un automate toi-même.${prompt}
  9555: Si tu veux vraiment devenir marionnettiste, je te conseille de parler à Iruki-Waraki à la Porte Blanche d’Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  9556: Manipuler des marionnettes peut être difficile, mais ne te laisse pas décourager !${prompt}
  9557: Bonne chance !${prompt}
  9558: Comment vas-tu ?${prompt}
  9559: Eh bien, tu es devenu un excellent marionnettiste. Je dois travailler dur pour ne pas me laisser distancer !${prompt}
  9560: Bref, y a-t-il quelque chose dont tu voulais parler ?${prompt}
  9561: Haha, ne te méprends pas. Tu avais juste l’air tellement curieux... Savoir lire les expressions des gens fait partie de mon métier, tu sais.${prompt}
  9562: Puisque nous exerçons le même métier maintenant, je serais ravi de répondre à toutes tes questions.${prompt}
  9563: Iruki-Waraki s’est mis dans une sacrée situation, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9564: Et pourtant... un marionnettiste rejeté par son propre automate... Haha, c’est génial ! Je pourrais utiliser une chute comme celle-là dans ma prochaine performance...${prompt}
  9565: Attends, il voulait mon avis ?${prompt}
  9566: Faire en sorte que son automate l’apprécie à nouveau devrait être un jeu d’enfant ! Car Iruki-Waraki possède la chose la plus précieuse qu’un marionnettiste puisse avoir ! Dis-lui simplement ça.${prompt}
  9567: Son automate ne réalise tout simplement pas qu’il l’a.${prompt}
  9568: D’ailleurs, Iruki-Waraki lui-même ne s’en rend pas compte.${prompt}
  9569: Quelle est cette chose précieuse ?${prompt}
  9570: La chose la plus essentielle, la plus importante qu’un marionnettiste puisse avoir est... Non, ce n’est pas quelque chose que je peux dire à n’importe qui.${prompt}
  9571: D’abord, je dois déterminer si tu es digne de le savoir. Les marionnettistes devraient vraiment le remarquer d’eux-mêmes après avoir progressé dans leur art...${prompt}
  9572: 'Si tu veux prouver que tu es digne, prends ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} et rends-toi à la Crique de Talacca sur les Îles Arrapago.${prompt}'
  9573: 'Ah, mais avant ça, tu auras aussi besoin d’un ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. Les Trolls les utilisaient pendant la construction, alors tu pourrais en trouver un sur le Mont Zhayolm.${prompt}'
  9574: Dangereux ! Très dangereux !${prompt}
  9575: |-
    Eh bien, oui...
    Cela devrait être facile de ramener l’automate d’Iruki-Waraki à la raison, mais le processus pour y arriver sera toute une épreuve.${prompt}
  9576: Es-tu toujours sûr de vouloir aider mon élève ?${prompt}
  9577: |-
    Aider Iruki-Waraki ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Qu’il pleuve ou qu’il vente !
    Des volcans ? Non merci...${prompt}
  9578: On dirait qu’Iruki-Waraki a réussi à trouver un excellent élève lui-même.${prompt}
  9579: |-
    Hein, tu n’es pas son élève ?
    Eh bien, peu importe, ton soutien est admirable. Je prie pour ton succès.${prompt}
  9580: Bonne chance !${prompt}
  9581: De quoi as-tu peur ? Cela dit, si tu ne veux pas admettre ta faiblesse, je suppose que c’est acceptable...${prompt}
  9582: Le monde est plein d’épreuves, mais tu dois garder la tête haute et avancer.${prompt}
  9583: Je suis content que tu aies réussi à revenir ! Tu m’as inquiété un moment là.${prompt}
  9584: Alors, tu veux entendre la suite de ce que j’avais à dire, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9585: Mais d’abord, j’ai une question pour toi.${prompt}
  9586: Vas-tu me dire quelle a été ta réponse concernant la raison pour laquelle tu as pu vaincre l’automate ?${prompt}
  9587: |-
    Pourquoi as-tu été victorieux ?
    ${selection-lines}
    C’était un combat en un-contre-un.
    Shamarhaan n’était pas là.
    Mon automate est plus fort.${prompt}
  9588: Hmm... pas tout à fait, mais pas loin non plus. Si tu y réfléchis un peu plus, tu devrais comprendre.${prompt}
  9589: Parce que c’était un-contre-un... En d’autres termes, il y a une différence significative entre un automate avec un marionnettiste et un automate seul.${prompt}
  9590: En d’autres termes... parce que l’automate était sans son maître, correct ? Cela implique aussi que tu aurais perdu si j’avais été là...${prompt}
  9591: Oui... Maintenant, laisse-moi t’expliquer pourquoi ton automate a pu devenir plus fort qu’un modèle de combat de premier ordre...${prompt}
  9592: Les bons marionnettistes peuvent libérer le potentiel de leur automate. Sans les efforts du marionnettiste, l’automate ne peut pas réaliser sa véritable force.${prompt}
  9593: Un automate sans marionnettiste, c’est comme un gobelin sans masque !${prompt}
  9594: Un gobelin sans masque, c’est...${prompt}
  9595: Quoi ? Iruki-Waraki a dit la même chose !?${prompt}
  9596: |-
    Eh bien, le petit...
    On dirait que j’ai volé sa phrase...${prompt}
  9597: J’ai attendu si longtemps pour utiliser cette phrase... pour rien !${prompt}
  9598: Bref, passons à autre chose, d’accord ? Ahem, où en étions-nous ?${prompt}
  9599: Ah, oui. La force d’un automate est révélée par les efforts de son marionnettiste. Même ainsi, seuls quelques marionnettistes à Vana’diel parviennent réellement à libérer la vraie puissance de leur automate.${prompt}
  9600: Cela nécessite une compréhension profonde de son automate et une grande dose de confiance.${prompt}
  9601: Tu sais déjà quelle est la chose la plus importante qu’un marionnettiste puisse avoir, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9602: Le combat contre mon automate était un test pour voir combien de force tu pouvais tirer de ton automate.${prompt}
  9603: Tu as réussi ! L’aventurier est fort !${prompt}
  9604: Oui... Cependant, un bon marionnettiste peut faire ressortir bien plus qu’une simple capacité de combat chez son automate.${prompt}
  9605: La croissance d’un automate vient de la force que le marionnettiste l’aide à réaliser, et un marionnettiste n’est aussi bon que son automate.${prompt}
  9606: Iruki-Waraki a pris cette vieille chose délabrée et en a fait un automate magnifique. Je suis certain qu’il possède ce pouvoir inestimable... le pouvoir de révéler le potentiel d’un automate.${prompt}
  9607: Hé, il y a longtemps, son automate était comme celui-ci... Non, cet automate-ci est meilleur que le sien ne l’était.${prompt}
  9608: Hé, Monsieur, où est passée la marionnette ?${prompt}
  9609: Ah, c’est encore toi. Tu ne te lasses jamais de venir ici, hein ?${prompt}
  9610: Désolé, petit. J’ai jeté cette chose.${prompt}
  9611: |-
    Quoi !?
    Pourquoi as-tu fait ça ? Je voulais revoir son coup de poing-fusée !${prompt}
  9612: |-
    Ouais !
    Pourquoi as-tu dû la jeter ?${prompt}
  9613: Il vaut mieux ne pas garder une machine instable comme celle-là. Elle ne pouvait même plus bouger après que les Lamiae l’ont eue, et la traîner depuis a été une vraie galère... Il fallait la jeter, les enfants.${prompt}
  9614: Sans-cœur méchant !${prompt}
  9615: Toi... gros tête de pudding !${prompt}
  9616: Allez, les enfants... Oubliez ça, déjà. Cette machine ne vaut rien.${prompt}
  9617: Non ! C’est toi qui ne vaux rien !${prompt}
  9618: Exactement !${prompt}
  9619: Très bien ! Je vais aller la récupérer !${prompt}
  9620: D’accord, d’accord, comme tu veux. Bonne chance, petit.${prompt}
  9621: Si tu la trouves, elle est à toi.${prompt}
  9622: Je peux l’avoir ! Tu as promis, souviens-t’en ! Je la trouverai quoi qu’il arrive !${prompt}
  9623: Monsieuuur ! Oh Monsieuuur !${prompt}
  9624: Quel est tout ce vacarme, petit ? As-tu trouvé quelque chose ?${prompt}
  9625: Oui, c’était facile ! Je vais te la montrer dans une seconde !${prompt}
  9626: |-
    Hein ?
    Tu veux dire que tu es allé jusqu’à Arrapago... ?${prompt}
  9627: (Le public n’a plus le droit de naviguer vers Nashmau maintenant à cause de l’épidémie...)${prompt}
  9628: La voilà...${prompt}
  9629: C’est... bien celle-là...${prompt}
  9630: Tu as promis ! Cette marionnette est à moi maintenant, pas vrai ?${prompt}
  9631: (Mais comment, par Urhguum, a-t-il... Hm ? Qu’est-ce que c’est ?)${prompt}
  9632: (Elle n’est équipée d’aucune arme... Seule son apparence extérieure est la même...)${prompt}
  9633: Où as-tu trouvé ça ?${prompt}
  9634: Je l’ai trouvée dans une boutique. Un Galka bizarre a quitté sa boutique pour aller ramasser des trucs.${prompt}
  9635: Je parie qu’il a juste réussi à trouver celle que tu as jetée.${prompt}
  9636: (Une boutique... Parle-t-il de l’atelier de Ghatsad ?)${prompt}
  9637: (J’ai entendu des rumeurs qu’il travaille sur des modèles pour un usage civil... Que mijote ce vieux filou ?)${prompt}

    Ah... oui, c’est vrai.
    Mais est-ce qu’elle fonctionne seulement ? Elle a été jetée... et elle semble en très mauvais état.${prompt}
  9643: Comment je saurais ? Et c’est toi qui l’as jetée !${prompt}
  9644: Allez, debout ! Debout !${prompt}
  9645: Eh bien, ça ne va pas marcher comme ça. N’y a-t-il pas un interrupteur quelque part ?${prompt}
  9646: Euh... Il y a un truc bizarre en forme de bâton attaché ici... Est-ce que ça pourrait être ça ?${prompt}
  9647: Whoa !${prompt}
  9648: Hein !?${prompt}

  9725: D’accord, aventurier. Grand-père m’a dit de te dire ceci...${prompt}
  9726: L’esprit sombre de Diabolos plane dans ton sillage.${prompt}
  9727: Tout comme le maître des rêves étend ses bras nébuleux pour libérer les justes, toi aussi tu portes dans ton cœur la force de rester calme dans les pires situations, et de guider ces agneaux égarés dans l’abîme vers la lumière de la victoire.${prompt}
  9728: En d’autres termes, il dit que tu es un leader né ! Alors, ne devrais-tu pas être en train de rassembler un groupe et de donner des ordres, ou quelque chose comme ça ?${prompt}
  9729: Oh, et il dit aussi que même si tu as l’étoffe d’un grand ${choice-player-gender}[homme/femme], les gens ne te suivront jamais si tu n’ajoutes pas un peu de “bravoure” et de “dynamisme” à ton CV. À toi de voir !${prompt}
  9730: L’esprit scintillant de Carbuncle flotte au-dessus de toi.${prompt}
  9731: Et tout comme la délicate lumière rubis de l’apporteur d’arcs-en-ciel apaise les âmes fatiguées, la douce et chaude radiance qui émane de ton cœur réconforte ceux dans le besoin.${prompt}
  9732: En d’autres termes, il dit que tu es toujours gentil avec les gens. Tu sais, les aider avec leurs problèmes et tout ça. Si tu n’es pas déjà mage blanc, peut-être devrais-tu envisager un changement de carrière.${prompt}
  9733: Oh, et il dit aussi que la seule façon pour que les gens te respectent est de les aider sans rien attendre en retour. Un peu comme aider un enfant à obtenir un cadeau du Nouvel An sans vouloir une récompense après, tu ne crois pas ?${prompt}
  9734: L’esprit dynamique de Ramuh marche à tes côtés.${prompt}
  9735: Tout comme le monde brille de sa sagesse électrique, ton esprit aussi resplendit d’une intelligence infinie qui provoque des frissons d’excitation et d’admiration parmi la foule.${prompt}
  9736: En d’autres termes, tu es un ${choice-player-gender}[type/dame] intelligent(e), plein(e) de curiosité et toujours en quête de changement. Tu ne serais pas mage rouge, par hasard ?${prompt}
  9737: Oh, et il dit aussi que si tu faisais un peu plus attention à ceux qui t’entourent, les gens ne diraient peut-être pas toutes ces méchancetés dans ton dos. À toi de voir !${prompt}
  9738: L’esprit imposant de Titan se dresse au-dessus de toi.${prompt}
  9739: Tout comme sa volonté adamantine protège les faibles de la misère, toi aussi tu parcours le chemin de la vie avec prudence tout en offrant un refuge à toutes les âmes qui se rassemblent dans la chaleur de ton cœur.${prompt}
  9740: En d’autres termes, tu réfléchis avant d’agir, pas comme ces idiots qui tirent d’abord et posent des questions le prochain Feudi. Ta capacité à repérer rapidement le point faible d’un ennemi et à l’achever avant qu’il ne blesse tes amis fait de toi un bon candidat pour mage noir.${prompt}
  9741: Oh, et il dit aussi que si tu étais un peu plus honnête, les gens te respecteraient peut-être plus que ce type aux écuries de chocobos qui vend à tout le monde des légumes gysahl avec des insectes dedans.${prompt}
  9742: L’esprit murmurant de Garuda tourbillonne autour de toi.${prompt}
  9743: Tout comme l’avatar du vent erre librement dans les cieux infinis de Vana’diel, ton cœur lucide aspire lui aussi à briser les chaînes qui le lient à la conformité.${prompt}
  9744: En d’autres termes, il dit que tu es né(e) pour être aventurier(ère), et que ton esprit libre ferait de toi un sacrément bon voleur, s’il existe une chose comme un bon voleur.${prompt}
  9745: Oh, et il dit aussi que tu serais bien plus populaire si tu arrêtais d’essayer d’impressionner tout le monde et que tu étais simplement toi-même. À toi de voir !${prompt}
  9746: L’esprit éclatant de Leviathan veille sur toi.${prompt}
  9747: Tout comme le visage radieux du gardien des mers laisse les âmes fades sans souffle, l’équilibre parfait entre ton attention à la beauté et ton respect de l’harmonie sont les vagues sur lesquelles tes compagnons jettent leurs vaisseaux.${prompt}
  9748: En d’autres termes, cet “équilibre parfait” t’empêche d’être influencé(e) par les opinions empoisonnées des autres, et te donne un bon jugement dans les situations délicates. Ajoute à ça tout ce discours sur l’harmonie, et on dirait que tu ferais un bon barde.${prompt}
  9749: Oh, et il dit aussi que si tu arrêtais de te soucier de ce que tu portes à l’extérieur et te concentrais plus sur polir ce qu’il y a à l’intérieur, les gens arrêteraient peut-être de t’éviter. À toi de voir !${prompt}
  9750: L’esprit glacial de Shiva ombre ton âme.${prompt}
  9751: Et tout comme son voile de givre cache le monde aux yeux des hommes, toi aussi tu portes un manteau de discrétion tandis que tu voyages seul(e) à travers les vallées de la solitude.${prompt}
  9752: En d’autres termes, il dit que tu es un joueur calme, cool et posé qui a une réponse à tous les défis que la vie te lance. Ça ressemble à du matériel pour mage bleu !${prompt}
  9753: Oh, et il a aussi dit que si tu arrêtais de pointer les défauts des gens et te concentrais sur ce qu’ils ont à l’intérieur, tu découvrirais peut-être ce qu’est la vraie amitié. Aïe !${prompt}
  9754: L’esprit brûlant d’Ifrit marche à tes côtés.${prompt}
  9755: Tout comme l’incendie dans son âme crache des flammes d’émotion immortelle, le feu au fond de ton cœur brûle avec la passion et la détermination d’affronter n’importe quel défi.${prompt}
  9756: En d’autres termes, une fois que tu as décidé quelque chose, même un seau de pamama au lait ne t’empêchera pas de foncer dans la pièce et de vider ton carquois de carreaux sanglants sur tout ce qui se dresse sur ton chemin. Ça ressemble à un guerrier de premier ordre pour moi.${prompt}
  9757: Oh, et il a aussi dit que si tu commençais à être un peu plus décisif(ve), les gens arrêteraient de refuser de rejoindre ton groupe parce qu’ils pensent que ça te prendra trois jours pour choisir un endroit où camper contre des colibris mineurs. À toi de voir !${prompt}
  9758: L’esprit intimidant d’Odin se tient prêt à tes côtés.${prompt}
  9759: Tout comme l’ambition du puissant conquérant le pousse dans les bras de la Victoire, l’harmonie dans ton cœur guide aussi les âmes égarées vers les chemins qu’elles cherchent.${prompt}
  9760: En d’autres termes, il dit que ta foi en tes croyances, combinée à ta haine de tout ce qui est mal, garde ton cœur pur – assez pur pour endurer les épreuves d’un paladin.${prompt}
  9761: Oh, et il dit aussi que tu es en réalité très sensible, mais trop honteux(se) pour montrer tes vrais sentiments, alors tu les enfermes tous à l’intérieur. Tu ferais mieux de régler ça ou tu te retrouveras à combattre de vilains ulcères. À ta santé !${prompt}
  9762: L’esprit noble de Fenrir garde tes ombres.${prompt}
  9763: Tout comme le gardien de la lumière de la lune chasse les ténèbres du royaume de la nuit, tu suis le soleil à travers terres et cieux, de l’aube au crépuscule, de la naissance à la mort. Tu vois le monde à une échelle qui surpasse même les plus puissantes montagnes et leurs pics enneigés.${prompt}
  9764: En d’autres termes, il dit que tu es toujours à la recherche de bons moments, et que tu es toujours au courant des dernières modes et tendances. Peut-être devrais-tu envisager d’être corsaire ou marionnettiste. Allez ! Tout le monde le fait !${prompt}
  9765: Oh, et il a aussi dit que ton refus d’agir normalement de temps en temps effraie beaucoup de gens. Garde ça en tête avant de courir à la maison des enchères en ne portant que ton subligar.${prompt}
  9766: L’esprit puissant de Bahamut plane au-dessus de toi.${prompt}
  9767: Tout comme le Roi des Wyrms domine les cieux par sa simple présence, toi aussi tu te tiens au-dessus des hommes inférieurs avec ton aura distincte de fortune et de conviction.${prompt}
  9768: En d’autres termes, il dit qu’en combinant la logique et les idéaux qui encombrent ton cerveau avec un peu de la chance qui sauve ton derrière paresseux tout le temps, tu aurais le pouvoir d’invoquer une grande puissance... comme un invocateur !${prompt}
  9769: Oh, et il dit aussi que si tu arrêtais d’essayer si fort et te reposais un peu plus sur les sourires que la Fortune continue de t’envoyer, les gens pourraient vraiment penser que tu es compétent(e). À toi de voir !${prompt}

  10012: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  10013: “Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt}
  10014: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  10015: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  10016: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}

  10018: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  10019: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}
  10020: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt}

  10031: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  10032: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  10033: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  10034: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  10035: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  10036: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  10037: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}

  10039: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10040: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  10041: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  10042: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10043: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  10044: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  10045: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10046: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  10047: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt}
  10048: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}
  10049: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt}

  10052: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt}
  10053: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt}

    Taking a walk.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10058: In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  10059: Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt}
  10060: On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt}
  10061: However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt}
  10062: You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  10063: Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt}
  10064: You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.${prompt}
  10065: I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt}
  10066: Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt}
  10067: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt}
  10068: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt}
  10069: You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt}
  10070: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt}
  10071: Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!${prompt}

    What would you like to know about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Why feeding is important.
    Vegetables.
    Wildgrasses.
    Carrots.
    Worms.
    Medicines.
    Pastes.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10073: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt}
  10074: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt}
  10075: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  10076: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  10077: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}
  10078: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt}
  10079: 'Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt}'
  10080: 'This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which ${item-plural: 0[2]} are most popular.${prompt}'
  10081: 'Chocobos also seem to enjoy ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  10082: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt}
  10083: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt}
  10084: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt}'
  10085: 'In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It''s a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt}'
  10086: Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.${prompt}
  10087: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, for example, affect the chocobo''s physical attributes, and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are good for its mental attributes. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are in a category of their own.${prompt}'
  10088: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  10089: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  10090: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'
  10091: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt}
  10092: 'The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt}'
  10093: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  10094: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo''s energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt}'
  10095: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt}'
  10096: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt}
  10097: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}
  10098: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt}

    Which would you like to ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Abilities.
    Temperament.
    Weather preferences.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10101: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  10102: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  10103: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  10104: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  10105: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  10106: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  10107: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  10108: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  10109: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  10110: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}
  10111: 'When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  10112: 'You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  10113: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt}
  10114: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt}
  10115: 'You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}'
  10116: 'You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10117: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt}
  10118: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10119: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  10120: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt}

  11255: |-
    Why not!?
    Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt}
  11256: We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt}
  11257: However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt}
  11258: The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt}
  11259: And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt}
  11260: Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt}
  11261: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  11262: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  11263: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  11264: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  11265: Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt}
  11266: Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt}
  11267: In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
  11268: Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt}
  11269: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  11270: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  11271: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  11272: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  11273: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  11274: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  11275: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  11276: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  11277: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt}'
  11278: You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt}
  11279: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  11280: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  11281: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  11282: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  11283: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  11284: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}

  11548: The promenade itself is split into eastern and western halves, both of which house all of the same facilities. Be sure to stop by and have a look when you get a chance.${prompt}
  11549: 'Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, as well as collecting your winnings.${prompt}'
  11550: There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.${prompt}
  11551: All chocobet centers are capable of providing the same services.${prompt}
  11552: The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.${prompt}
  11553: To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.${prompt}
  11554: 'The standard admission fee is ${number: 0} gil. Patrons who possess ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} may enter free of charge.${prompt}'

  11557: This racetrack is equipped with portals to transport our patrons to any of the three nations, as well as Jeuno and Al Zahbi.${prompt}
  11558: As you can see, we are regularly visited by a multitude of race fans, breeders, and jockeys from every realm imaginable. We have therefore relegated each portal to a single destination in an attempt to avoid congestion.${prompt}

    Race Progression.
    That's about it.${prompt}
  11564: A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt}
  11565: Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt}
  11566: In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt}
  11567: For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt}
  11568: The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt}
  11569: What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt}
  11570: Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  11571: Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt}
  11572: The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt}
  11573: The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt}
  11574: The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt}
  11575: In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt}
  11576: Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt}
  11577: Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt}
  11578: For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt}
  11579: We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt}
  11580: No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt}
  11581: Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt}
  11582: As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt}
  11583: Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  11584: Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt}
  11585: Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt}
  11586: The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt}
  11587: As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt}
  11588: Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  11589: We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt}
  11590: Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt}
  11591: Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt}
  11592: Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt}

    I'm fine, thanks.${prompt}
  11594: There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt}
  11595: First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt}
  11596: Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt}
  11597: Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt}
  11598: All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt}
  11599: A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt}
  11600: Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt}
  11601: There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt}
  11602: There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt}
  11603: 'Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt}'
  11604: 'In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt}'
  11605: The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt}
  11606: You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt}
  11607: 'To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt}'
  11608: The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt}
  11609: You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt}
  11610: After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt}
  11611: This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt}
  11612: We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt}

    What would you like to ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is chocobetting?
    How do I bet?
    What are odds?
    When do I bet?
    How do I collect winnings?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  11614: Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt}
  11615: To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt}
  11616: Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt}
  11617: For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt}
  11618: And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt}
  11619: Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt}
  11620: The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt}
  11621: 'To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt}'
  11622: 'For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt}'
  11623: We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt}
  11624: Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt}
  11625: Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt}
  11626: It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt}
  11627: What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt}
  11628: 'Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt}'
  11629: The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt}
  11630: Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt}
  11631: Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt}
  11632: Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt}
  11633: 'Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt}'
  11634: 'Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  11635: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt}'
  11636: Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.${prompt}

  11699: With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt}
  11700: As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt}
  11701: “The Monster Races”!${prompt}
  11702: Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt}
  11703: |-
    Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.
    What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt}
  11704: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  11705: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  11706: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  11707: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  11708: Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt}
  11709: |-
    The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.
    It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt}
  11710: |-
    Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.
    If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt}
  11711: |-
    Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.
    Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt}
  11712: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  11713: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  11714: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  11715: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  11716: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  11717: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  11718: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  11719: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  11720: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo''s performance.${prompt}'
  11721: |-
    You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.
    Thank you for your understanding.${prompt}
  11722: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  11723: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  11724: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  11725: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  11726: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  11727: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  11728: Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt}
  11729: |-
    We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.
    The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt}
  11730: |-
    Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.
    And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt}
  11731: |-
    As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.
    It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.
    Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  11732: |-
    In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.
    Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.
    It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt}
  11733: |-
    Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.
    These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt}
  11734: |-
    ★Dueler's Race★

  11802: ピヨピヨ！${prompt}
  11803: She says, “When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.”${prompt}
  11804: She says, “And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' all☆star!“${prompt}
  11805: She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt}
  11806: She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt}
  11807: She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt}
  11808: She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt}
  11809: She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt}
  11810: She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt}
  11811: 'Next we have ${choice: 0}[Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by ${choice: 0}[the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].${prompt}'

  11821: She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.${prompt}

  11823: She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.${prompt}
  11824: And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.${prompt}
  11825: And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?${prompt}
  11826: The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.${prompt}
  11827: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.

  11836: Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
  11837: I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.${prompt}
  11838: Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!${prompt}
  11839: |-
    Yeah...
    Good luck, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  11840: Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.${prompt}
  11841: 'And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt}'
  11842: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt}
  11843: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt}
  11844: Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt}
  11845: They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt}
  11846: Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt}
  11847: Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt}
  11848: As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt}
  11849: ${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt}
  11850: Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt}
  11851: Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt}
  11852: 'And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt}'
  11853: ピヨッ！${prompt}
  11854: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt}
  11855: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt}
  11856: Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt}
  11857: Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt}
  11858: a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt}
  11859: This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt}
  11860: Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  11861: It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt}
  11862: We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt}
  11863: Well, there you have it.${prompt}
  11864: Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt}
  11865: |-
    Ladies and gentlemen!
    President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...${prompt}
  11866: '...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!${prompt}'
  11867: Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.${prompt}
  11868: Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt}
  11869: Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  11870: Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt}
  11871: The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt}
  11872: Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt}
  11873: So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt}
  11874: Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt}
  11875: Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt}
  11876: My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt}
  11877: '${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt}'
  11878: We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt}
  11879: Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt}
  11880: Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt}
  11881: What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt}
  11882: Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt}
  11883: Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt}
  11884: Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt}
  11885: Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt}
  11886: Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt}
  11887: 'And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d''Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d''Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt}'
  11888: Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt}
  11889: Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt}
  11890: Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt}
  11891: The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt}
  11892: When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt}
  11893: When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt}
  11894: And they're off!
  11895: Markovich, what did you think of the start?
  11896: Well, I fel--
  11897: ピヨピヨッ！
  11898: Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
  11899: Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  11900: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  11901: And as they pass the halfway mark...
  11902: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} holds on to the lead!'
  11903: '${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!'
  11904: 'While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  11905: 'While from behind, #${number: 2} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  11906: 'All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!'
  11907: Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
  11908: And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
  11909: ピヨピヨ！
  11910: Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”
  11911: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  11912: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  11913: 'Incredible! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed is approaching dangerous limits!'
  11914: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!'
  11915: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  11916: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed has begun to drop off!'
  11917: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has begun to tire!'
  11918: The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  11919: The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  11920: The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
  11921: The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
  11922: 'The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  11923: 'Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  11924: 'And yet ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems completely unaffected by the attack!'
  11925: And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  11926: And now they're approaching the final corner!
  11927: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  11928: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  11929: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  11930: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!'
  11931: The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  11932: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  11933: 'And ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} takes the crown!'
  11934: 'What''s this? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  11935: 'And it''s ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} by a beak!!!'
  11936: Let's take a look at the results...${prompt}
  11937: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})${prompt}'
  11938: There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt}
  11939: Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt}
  11940: Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt}
  11941: Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt}
  11942: |-
    What an amazing race!
    The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt}
  11943: 'What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird''s performance?${prompt}'
  11944: '${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt}'
  11945: The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt}
  11946: Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt}
  11947: Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt}
  11948: Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt}
  11949: The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt}
  11950: |-
    And there you have it.
    This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt}
  11951: And now, let's see the results from the last race.
  11952: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})'
  11953: And that's all she wrote, folks!
  11954: 'The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!'
  11955: Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
  11956: She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
  11957: She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
  11958: Until next time, race fans...
  11959: Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt}
  11960: 'Taking the crown for today''s race was none other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  11961: 'To the winning steed''s owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt}'
  11962: 'And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  11963: Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt}
  11964: |-
    Excellent race, ${name-player}!
    You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt}
  11965: Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt}
  11966: Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt}
  11967: But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt}

  11981: With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...${prompt}
  11982: |-
    Oh...?
    Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?${prompt}
  11983: I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt}
  11984: |-
    Is that so...?
    Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt}
  11985: |-
    Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.
    You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt}
  11986: Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt}
  11987: Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt}
  11988: |-
    But of course! I had forgotten all about it!
    Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!
    Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt}
  11989: |-
    But that's not where it ends!
    There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt}
  11990: |-
    A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.
    Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt}
  11991: It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt}
  11992: |-
    Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!
    But...${prompt}
  11993: But...?${prompt}
  11994: I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt}
  11995: |-
    I see...
    Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt}
  11996: |-
    You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.
    Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt}
  11997: |-
    But enough talking, I say.
    It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt}
  11998: |-
    Oh, yes, right...
    Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!
    It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt}
  11999: 'In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt}'
  12000: |-
    Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?
    I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt}
  12001: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don''t let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep''s clothing”!${prompt}'
  12002: I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt}
  12003: I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt}
  12004: Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt}
  12005: Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt}
  12006: With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt}
  12007: |-
    Whoopee!
    Bring them on, I say!${prompt}
  12008: |-
    Erm...yes...
    Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt}
  12009: Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt}
  12010: |-
    Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!
    Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt}
  12011: |-
    Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.
    I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt}
  12012: And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt}
  12013: |-
    My, oh my...!
    I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt}
  12014: |-
    A-ahem!
    I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt}
  12015: |-
    All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!
    Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt}
  12016: |-
    It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...
    <Sniffle>${prompt}
  12017: |-
    Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    ...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  12018: |-
    Hrmmm...
    Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt}
  12019: Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt}
  12020: |-
    What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!
    There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt}
  12021: Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt}
  12022: |-
    And won't you look at the lineup!
    This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?
    I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt}
  12023: And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt}
  12024: |-
    Huh?
    Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt}
  12025: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt}
  12026: |-
    <Gulp>
    You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt}
  12027: '...Professor Shantotto!${prompt}'
  12028: |-
    If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,
    as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt}
  12029: |-
    Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,
    four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt}
  12030: |-
    So if you care to hear out my little proposal,
    these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt}
  12031: |-
    With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...
    Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt}
  12032: |-
    With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?
    Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt}
  12033: First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt}
  12034: |-
    Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.
    I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt}
  12035: Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt}
  12036: |-
    Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”
    Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt}
  12037: Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt}
  12038: |-
    Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.
    If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt}
  12039: Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt}
  12040: |-
    For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.
    Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt}
  12041: |-
    Um...Professor Shantotto...
    Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt}
  12042: |-
    Ohohohohoho!
    Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.
    But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt}
  12043: |-
    Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.
    Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt}
  12044: |-
    Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.
    So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt}
  12045: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--
    that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt}
  12046: |-
    The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.
    But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt}
  12047: |-
    H-hey!
    What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt}
  12048: |-
    My, my, what a pleasant surprise!
    I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt}
  12049: |-
    How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!
    This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt}
  12050: |-
    Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.
    I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt}
  12051: |-
    And you, Goccilo!
    What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt}
  12052: |-
    Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!
    Until next time...!${prompt}
  12053: ${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt}
  12054: |-
    What's with the baffled expression?
    It's me, Sakura.${prompt}
  12055: |-
    You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.
    I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt}
  12056: I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt}
  12057: I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt}
  12058: And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt}
  12059: I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt}
  12060: Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt}
  12061: I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  12062: I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12063: |-
    And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    But something seems to be different...
    Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt}
  12064: She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt}
  12065: The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt}
  12066: |-
    I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!
    A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt}
  12067: And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt}
  12068: It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt}
  12069: |-
    And that completes the lineup, folks.
    With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt}
  12070: 'You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12071: Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12072: I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt}
  12073: I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt}
  12074: I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt}
  12075: |-
    But no more...
    If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt}
  12076: This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt}
  12077: I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12078: Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt}
  12079: Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  12080: I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt}
  12081: Next, we have Sakura...${prompt}
  12082: |-
    Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
    This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt}
  12083: |-
    Well I'll be...
    In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt}
  12084: '...${prompt}'
  12085: |-
    Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.
    For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt}
  12086: '${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt}'
  12087: |-
    Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!
    Congratulations!${prompt}
  12088: |-
    Great race, ${name-player}.
    It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt}
  12089: |-
    But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..
    With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt}
  12090: |-
    Princess...
    Princess Sakura!${prompt}
  12091: |-
    Princess...?
    What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt}
  12092: |-
    Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.
    I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt}
  12093: Searching for...me?${prompt}
  12094: |-
    Yes, Your Highness.
    You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt}
  12095: |-
    Are you serious!?
    Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt}
  12096: |-
    That is correct.
    Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt}
  12097: D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt}
  12098: |-
    ...!
    I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt}
  12099: Wh...what happened?${prompt}
  12100: |-
    You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.
    You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt}
  12101: She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt}
  12102: |-
    Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.
    But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt}
  12103: My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt}
  12104: So that's what happened...${prompt}
  12105: Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt}
  12106: '...${prompt}'
  12107: I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt}
  12108: |-
    Your Highness!
    But...why!?${prompt}
  12109: Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt}
  12110: What's more...${prompt}
  12111: I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt}
  12112: I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt}
  12113: What...?${prompt}
  12114: The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt}
  12115: |-
    And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?
    I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt}
  12116: I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt}
  12117: |-
    Heehee!
    Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt}
  12118: |-
    ${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!
    Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt}
  12119: You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  12120: Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt}
  12121: |-
    What?
    How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt}
  12122: |-
    Hohoho...
    It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt}
  12123: I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt}
  12124: |-
    Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?
    No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt}
  12125: Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt}
  12126: |-
    <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.
    But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt}
  12127: |-
    You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.
    To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt}
  12128: |-
    And you, our new Chocochampion!
    Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt}
  12129: |-
    Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.
    These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt}
  12130: And they're off!
  12131: |-
    Hrmmm!
    ${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
  12132: Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
  12133: |-
    All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.
    But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
  12134: Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  12135: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  12136: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  12137: The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  12138: The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
  12139: And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  12140: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  12141: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!'
  12142: The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  12143: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!'
  12144: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  12145: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  12146: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  12147: 'What''s this? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  12148: '${number: 1}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}${prompt}'
  12149: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!'
  12150: 'Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!'
  12151: |-
    ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!
    And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
  12152: "I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s step. \nAnd the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!"
  12153: |-
    And here's some unexpected drama, folks!
    The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
  12154: 'Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!'
  12155: |-
    Uh-oh, what's going on here!?
    The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
  12156: 'Oooh! In a bold move, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!'
  12157: |-
    What's this!?
    All of the chocobos other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
  12158: |-
    Thanks to that brazen little act, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!
    That just might seal the deal for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!
  12159: |-
    Never in all my days, race fans!
    In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
  12160: |-
    How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?
    In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
  12161: Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
  12162: The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
  12163: The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
  12164: The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
  12165: |-
    Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?
    What in the world do you think you're doing!?
  12166: |-
    Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.
    This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
  12167: |-
    What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?
    I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.
    This could get heavy, folks!
  12168: |-
    All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.
    Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
  12169: It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
  12170: |-
    There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!
    More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
  12171: And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
  12172: |-
    The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.
    This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
  12173: |-
    This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.
    Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
  12174: |-
    And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!
    Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
  12175: |-
    And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!
    But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
  12176: |-
    I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!
    Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
  12177: |-
    It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!
    The time for a final spurt is now or never!
  12178: And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
  12179: |-
    It's here! It's here!
    The season of Celestial Nights is upon us! And to celebrate, the moogles are bringing together lost loves by offering free teleportation to San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst!${prompt}
  12180: If there's someone you've been longing to see, just let me know and I'll warp you right to their side (provided they are in either San d'Oria, Bastok, or Windurst), kupo!${prompt}
  12181: |-
    Where would you like to go?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nowhere.
    San d'Oria.
    Bastok.
    Windurst.${prompt}
  12182: See you again, kupo!${prompt}
  12183: Oh, that's right! I almost forgot to give you this, kupo!${prompt}
  12184: Are you ready for another spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?${prompt}
  12185: |-
    We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.
    Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!${prompt}
  12186: |-
    Oh, a new adventurer!
    Best of luck, kupo!${prompt}
  12187: |-
    Are you helping out the new adventurers?
    Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!${prompt}
  12188: Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!${prompt}
  12189: |-
    The face in the portrait you brought me is just...
    Kupupupu!${prompt}
  12190: |-
    You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?
    Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt}
  12191: This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt}
  12192: |-
    To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.
    Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt}
  12193: |-
    This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.
    Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt}
  12194: |-
    Please come back with a different partner.
    It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt}
  12195: |-
    Your partner isn't ready to go.
    Please wait a little longer, kupo.${prompt}
  12196: |-
    Your partner must talk to me as well.
    I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt}
  12197: |-
    You can only choose one partner a day.
    Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt}
  12198: |-
    Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!
    You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt}
  12199: Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt}
  12200: Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt}
  12201: |-
    Are you ready to go?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ready, kupo!
    I'm too terrified, kupo!${prompt}
  12202: |-
    I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal.
    You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.${prompt}
  12203: |-
    If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!
    Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt}
  12204: 'You can only carry one ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12205: Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?${prompt}
  12206: |-
    Hey, you changed partners!
    You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt}
  12207: |-
    Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!
    You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt}
  12208: |-
    Choose your partner wisely.
    Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!${prompt}
  12209: |-
    You there.
    I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of part-time ghosts?${prompt}
  12210: |-
    Have you heard?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I've heard.
    Part-time ghosts!?${prompt}
  12211: Then we may move on to more important matters.${prompt}
  12212: We haven't been able to locate enough volunteers to participate in this year's festivities, and are searching for adventurers who would be willing to aid us.${prompt}
  12213: All you will be required to do is dress up in one of these frightening costumes and wander about the city with the other specters.${prompt}
  12214: |-
    <Sigh>...
    Then allow me to explain.${prompt}
  12215: A memorial is currently being held in honor of a long-lost coven of witches known as the Dark Lilies.${prompt}
  12216: During the memorial, volunteers dressed up as the witches and spirits walk a course about the city in honor of the deceased.${prompt}
  12217: However, while we have filled all the spots for the witches, we are quite short on people willing to play the part of the monsters who follow the Lilies.${prompt}
  12218: Would you be willing to lend a hand, fine ${choice-player-gender}[sir/lady]?${prompt}
  12219: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt}
  12220: |-
    Ah... How droll.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  12221: |-
    Most excellent.
    There is one thing you must be aware of, however.${prompt}
  12222: The witches have the most important role in this memorial service. You are to tread only in their wake. If it is found that you have stepped ahead of one of the Lilies, you will be asked to return your costume and leave the procession.${prompt}
  12223: Though, we are a forgiving organization, and if you wish to participate once again, either speak with me or simply put on another costume and your request shall be granted.${prompt}
  12224: Ah yes, and one more thing. There are two citizens playing the parts of the witches Guwanana and Bikho Ronpotteh.${prompt}
  12225: You are to follow the fair Mithran maid dressed as Bikho. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.${prompt}
  12226: Ah, welcome back, adventurer. You have done well. The Dark Lilies would be pleased.${prompt}
  12227: Please take this as a token of our appreciation.${prompt}
  12228: It is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies. Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities.${prompt}
  12229: Oh, and should you wish to aid us again, we would welcome your help. Many thanks, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12230: |-
    What has befallen you?
    Do you wish to give up?${prompt}
  12231: |-
    Give up?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm done.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  12232: |-
    A pity.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  12233: You are to follow the young maiden dressed as Guwanana. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.${prompt}
  12234: |-
    Good day!
    I suppose you've heard of all the people signing up to play ghosts in this year's festival, nay?${prompt}
  12235: |-
    Have you heard?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I've heard.
    Play ghosts!?${prompt}
  12236: I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.${prompt}
  12237: |-
    I'll get straight to the point, then.
    We need volunteers to dress up as ghosts, specters, wights, and the like, and walk around the city in honor of the Dark Lilies.${prompt}
  12238: Would you be willing to participate? You will be rewarded nicely!${prompt}
  12239: |-
    Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess.
    Let me give you the short version:${prompt}
  12240: We're putting on a grand parade for this season's Harvest Festival.${prompt}
  12241: We already have enough people to play the witches, but there can never be enough monsters, nay?${prompt}
  12242: That's why we need volunteers like you to make the parade even more exciting. Oh, worry not, adventurer. You will be rewarded nicely!${prompt}
  12243: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt}
  12244: |-
    Oh...
    Well, acting isn't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  12245: |-
    Thank you!
    Now, there is one thing you should know...${prompt}
  12246: The witches lead the procession. If you start getting any delusions of grandeur and work your way in front of the Lilies, you will be required to turn over your costume and forfeit all payment for services up to that point.${prompt}
  12247: But that doesn't mean you can't try again! Just put on another costume and get back in line. I'm sure you'll get the hang of things soon enough.${prompt}
  12248: 'Oh, and one more thing. There are two witches in this season''s parade: Selma and Pretty Heart.${prompt}'
  12249: You're to be stationed in Selma's parade, so don't go wandering over to Pretty Heart's, hear me?${prompt}
  12250: Good luck!${prompt}
  12251: Excellent job, ${name-player}! You've done the witches proud.${prompt}
  12252: Here's the reward I promised.${prompt}
  12253: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    The design matches those worn by the Dark Lilies. Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.${prompt}
  12254: Though, if you want to volunteer again, I'll be right here waiting for you!${prompt}
  12255: Giving up the ghost, eh?${prompt}
  12256: |-
    Oh...
    Well, acting isn't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  12257: You're to be stationed in Pretty Heart's parade, so don't go wandering over to Selma's, hear me?${prompt}
  12258: |-
    Hi, I'm Gertrude.
    I'm helping with some of the Harvest Festival activities. Have you heard about our hiring policies?${prompt}
  12259: |-
    Heard about them?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not at all.${prompt}
  12260: |-
    You have?
    Well, that makes my job easier, then.${prompt}
  12261: So, would you like to sign up for the Procession of the Lilies?${prompt}
  12262: |-
    No?
    Then let me fill you in on the details. We are currently holding a memorial for the Dark Lilies, in which two women dressed as members of the lost coven lead a party of spirits around the city.${prompt}
  12263: There is a shortage of volunteers for the witches' undead followers, and I was wondering if you would like to help.${prompt}
  12264: |-
    Sign up?
    ${selection-lines}
    Right away!
    Not today.${prompt}
  12265: |-
    Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard.
    Please come back if you change your mind.${prompt}
  12266: |-
    Wonderful.
    There are just two more things I must warn you of, however.${prompt}
  12267: First and foremost, during the procession, the witches are boss, so don't even think of stepping in front of them. If you do, your costume will be immediately confiscated.${prompt}
  12268: Ah, but if that happens, you need not worry. Just put on another costume and try again!${prompt}
  12269: Secondly, there are two witches in the city--Maryse and Poseaulloie.${prompt}
  12270: You are to join with Poseaulloie's congregation.${prompt}
  12271: Good luck!${prompt}
  12272: How did you fare...? Was the witch pleased?${prompt}
  12273: |-
    Either way, your help has been invaluable.
    Would you accept this in appreciation?${prompt}
  12274: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...${prompt}
  12275: Though, if you have time, we would gladly accept your help again.${prompt}
  12276: |-
    What's wrong?
    Have you grown tired of your duties?${prompt}
  12277: |-
    Oh, I see...
    Well, please return to me if you find your patience for them restored.${prompt}
  12278: You are to join with Maryse's congregation.${prompt}
  12279: I shall let you know when there is another opening.${prompt}
  12280: I'll let you know when a spot opens up.${prompt}
  12281: You'll be the first to know when I have a new opening.${prompt}
  12282: Ooops! You've stepped in front of the witch!${prompt}
  12283: You can't stop now. You've just started!${prompt}
  12284: You've only just begun.${prompt}
  12285: There's still a long way to go.${prompt}
  12286: Hope you didn't make any other plans, because you're not even close to being finished.${prompt}
  12287: Almost halfway...${prompt}
  12288: It's still a little too early to go back.${prompt}
  12289: Leave the procession now and someone might be peeved.${prompt}
  12290: Just a little longer...${prompt}
  12291: You're almost done!${prompt}
  12292: Alright! It's time to collect your reward!${prompt}
  12293: You've joined the procession.${prompt}
  12294: Adventurer! Adventurer!${prompt}
  12295: |-
    Might you lend a poor Moogle a hand?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure!
    Doing what?
    Not today.${prompt}
  12296: |-
    A thousand thanks, kupo!
    Your participation in the Neo Crystal War will benefit your nation in ways beyond imagination!${prompt}
  12297: |-
    Rules? Why, they are simple, my friend!
    All you need do is sneak your way into beastman lairs and retrieve shards from the ${color: 5}cyclopean crystals${color: 1} located about the strongholds, kupo!${prompt}
  12298: Which lairs? Must I tell you everything, adventurer? Moogle intelligence reports that the crystals can be found in the Ghelsba Outpost, Davoi, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja. Now what are you waiting for, kupo!?${prompt}
  12299: You see, recently there has been much unrest amongst our many Moogle factions, kupo.${prompt}
  12300: Why, you ask? Well, at one of our gatherings, an argument broke out regarding the Crystal War 20 years gone.${prompt}
  12301: 'It all started with the question: which nation played the biggest role in the allied forces'' victory over the beastmen armies?${prompt}'
  12302: And from there things degraded into a shouting match pitting San d'Oria versus Bastok versus Windurst, kupo...${prompt}
  12303: However, at the end of the day, no one could present hard evidence to the claim of their nation's greatness.${prompt}
  12304: And that is when one of our elders came up with a foolproof method to put an end to our doubts--we would have adventurers from all three nations fight the war again, kupo!${prompt}
  12305: By fighting, I don't mean fighting each other, but fighting the beastmen like our fathers did 20 years ago!${prompt}
  12306: One of the ways the allied armies were able to defeat the enemy was by intercepting and cutting off the Shadow Lord's crystal supply routes.${prompt}
  12307: We want you and other adventurers from across Vana'diel to take on the roles of allied solders and infiltrate beastman strongholds, kupo.${prompt}
  12308: Once inside, you are to locate large formations where the beastmen have been storing crystals over the past two decades...${prompt}
  12309: '...and break off as many shards as possible, then bring them back here, kupo.${prompt}'
  12310: The nation that brings back the most shards will be declared the Crystal War's “Most Valuable Nation” and the Moogles' squabbles will finally come to an end.${prompt}
  12311: |-
    So, what do you say, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm in.
    Maybe later.${prompt}
  12312: Kupopo... Did I mention that there will be wondrous prizes to adventurers from the victorious nation? Oh well, if you have a change of heart, you'll know where to find me!${prompt}
  12313: Kupopo...${prompt}
  12314: Welcome back, adventurer! Let me see how many shards you have retrieved, kupo...${prompt}
  12315: 'My records show that you have brought your nation a total of ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[shard/shards], but I know you''re not done yet, are you?${prompt}'
  12316: 'Amazing! You''ve already collected ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[shard/shards], kupo! I think I have something extra special for you!${prompt}'
  12317: Here's a little something to keep you motivated, kupo!${prompt}
  12318: 'Why are you talking to me? You should be out there aiding ${choice: 1}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst]''s fight to prove you are better than those ${choice: 0}[San d''Orians/Bastokers/Windurstians], kupo!${prompt}'
  12319: 'Congratulations on your victory, ${choice: 0}[San d''Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian]! Your nation has been selected Crystal War MVN, kupo! As a reward, I shall teleport you to any nation of your choice!${prompt}'
  12320: |-
    Where would like to go, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nowhere.
    San d'Oria.
    Bastok.
    Windurst.${prompt}
  12321: Happy travels, kupo!${prompt}
  12322: 'Moogles from across Vana''diel have heard of ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst]''s recent success in collecting crystal shards, and have come bearing gifts! For the next few days, ${choice: 0}[San d''Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian] vendors will be selling specialty goods from everywhere imaginable, kupo!${prompt}'
  12323: |-
    Oooh! It's ${name-player}!
    Your shard-collecting skills have left us Moogles in awe. It's my honor to present you with this special present, kupo!${prompt}

  12330: |-
    But we've sailed into a slight snag, kupo...
    There are so many adventurers that we've become...a little...confused...${prompt}
  12331: Hey! Maybe you could help us find the right adventurer for each present, kupo!${prompt}
  12332: |-
    I'm sure that if we could just meet them in person, we'd remember which gift was meant for whom.
    All you have to do is make a party with another adventurer, and then visit a moogle, kupo!${prompt}
  12333: We're counting on you, kupo!${prompt}
  12334: 'The recipient for this present was supposed to be ${choice: 8}[level 37 or lower/level 38 or higher].${prompt}'
  12335: 'And I''m pretty sure we were looking for ${choice: 9}[a male Hume/a female Hume/a male Elvaan/a female Elvaan/a male Tarutaru/a female Tarutaru/a Mithra/a Galka].${prompt}'

  12337: If you're having trouble finding the person we're looking for, it's okay to give up for now, kupo.${prompt}
  12338: |-
    Give up for now?
    ${selection-lines}
    That would be best.
    Not just yet!${prompt}
  12339: |-
    Yeah, that's a tough one, kupo.
    But I have plenty of other presents here if you'd still like to help!${prompt}
  12340: Hmmm...I don't think this is the person we're looking for, kupo.${prompt}
  12341: |-
    Hmmm...this isn't the person we're looking for, kupo.
    But, you know what? I think something's coming back to me...${prompt}
  12342: Oh, I stumbled across the present that was meant for the adventurer you brought with you, kupo!${prompt}
  12343: |-
    Presents can be claimed using a card just like this!
    Have your adventurer friend show the card to a moogle and receive a wonderful gift, kupo!${prompt}
  12344: Yes! This is the person I was looking for, kupo!${prompt}
  12345: |-
    Hand this card to your friend.
    It can be given to a moogle in exchange for a present, kupo!${prompt}
  12346: |-
    Your help was invaluable!
    Here, this is for you, kupo!${prompt}
  12347: |-
    There are still so many presents to hand out, kupo!
    Don't be shy about lending another helping hand!${prompt}
  12348: |-
    I'm so glad we found you!
    Here's your present, kupo!${prompt}
  12349: |-
    What are you trying to pull, kupo!?
    Give this card to the person it's addressed to, and have them come to a moogle to receive a present!${prompt}
  12350: One card at a time! I'm confused enough as it is, kupo!${prompt}
  12351: I remember 20 years ago when I was in charge of protecting Galkan Bridge from the beastmen.${prompt}
  12352: For a large part of the Crystal War, we had her blocked off on both sides. The government said it was to keep enemy spies from infiltrating Bastok's central areas. However, there were rumors that it was to prevent Galka from coming over on this side of the river and rioting.${prompt}
  12353: It would be a lie if I told you it wasn't hard for me, a Galka, to work against my brothers like that.${prompt}
  12354: I still have nightmares about the times I had to force back groups of refugees trying to escape the flames that engulfed their homes in the mines district.${prompt}
  12355: And now I'm back here patrolling the bridge as I did so long ago. Perhaps destiny has a tighter grip on us than I thought...${prompt}
  12356: |-
    That young'n has been waiting there for her friend for quite a stretch.
    I wonder what the holdup is.${prompt}
  12357: Ida must not like me anymore. That's it, we're through!${prompt}
  12358: |-
    Why don't you wait just a little more?
    I'm sure your friend has been delayed for some reason.${prompt}
  12359: How do you know that?${prompt}
  12360: When I was a little girl, I had a friend just like you.${prompt}
  12361: |-
    She always believed in me.
    That's why I was able to become the chef I am today.${prompt}
  12362: |-
    You should believe in your friend, as well.
    Think how terrible it would be to lose her over some silly misunderstanding.${prompt}
  12363: |-
    Hmm, I guess you're right. Ida would never break her word on purpose.
    I'll wait a little bit longer!${prompt}
  12364: Bruna!${prompt}
  12365: Ida! There you are!${prompt}
  12366: I'm sorry I'm late! My mother wouldn't let me out until I'd finished all my chores...${prompt}
  12367: It's okay. C'mon, let's go play!${prompt}
  12368: Bye!${prompt}
  12369: So sweet...${prompt}
  12370: I was pretty hard on you, wasn't I?${prompt}
  12371: |-
    And I've been overly strict with Leonhardt, as well.
    That was no way for a mentor to act...${prompt}
  12372: I owe it to Karla to be the best chef that I can be.${prompt}
  12373: And I have you to thank for bringing me to my senses.${prompt}
  12374: |-
    It's not much, but I baked you this pie to show my appreciation and apologize for my harsh words.
    I hope you can forgive me.${prompt}
  12375: Well, I'm glad that little one's friend came along at last.${prompt}
  12376: |-
    You know, I seem to recall a time when another little girl used to wait here.
    I wonder if she ever managed to catch up with her friend...${prompt}
  12377: Haaahhh, another squandered day. I probably should have gone to work...${prompt}
  12378: |-
    Oh... You heard that, huh? Hey, don't you judge me!
    I have a perfectly good reason for skipping work today.${prompt}
  12379: Do you know what a Bastokan Time Capsule is?${prompt}
  12380: |-
    It's when you and a group of friends all write letters to yourselves and place them in a box, which you then bury somewhere safe.
    It was a playful tradition we had around here during the dark days of the war to give us a little hope.${prompt}
  12381: |-
    Actually, some friends of mine and I put one together a long time ago.
    I went to dig it up recently, since I was the one in charge of burying it.${prompt}
  12382: But when I found it, the box had been ravaged and its contents plundered. Cursed goblins, no doubt.${prompt}
  12383: |-
    I would like to have known what hopes I had for the future back then.
    Caught in the drudgery of the daily routine, every day the same thing over and over... I just would like to have known.${prompt}
  12384: |-
    All the others were so looking forward to reading their letters.
    I can't even bring myself to look them in the eye. It's all my fault for choosing such a terrible spot to bury it.${prompt}
  12385: |-
    I was devastated when I found our time capsule. Battered and empty...
    Those goblins are the scourge of this world!${prompt}
  12386: |-
    A while back I went to dig up our letters but realized I had totally forgotten where they were buried.
    After that I totally lost the will to work...${prompt}
  12387: |-
    A while back I went to dig up our capsule, but found that it had been discovered and raided by goblins.
    There wasn't a single letter left to be found...${prompt}
  12388: |-
    We even went so far as to cover up the burial spot with a large rock. What more could we do?
    It looked like the goblins just tossed it aside like a pebble.${prompt}
  12389: |-
    If only we had put ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in the capsule as well.
    Maybe that would have diverted their attention away from the letters...${prompt}
  12390: Those confounded goblins! What I wouldn't give...${prompt}
  12391: |-
    Not too long ago I went to dig up the box we buried containing our letters and found it lying above ground, empty.
    It looks like the goblins found it after all, just as I feared.${prompt}
  12392: |-
    It occurred to me to put ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in the box to draw the goblins' attention away from the letters.
    But it seems they left the lid open and the letters just blew away.${prompt}
  12393: |-
    A false-bottom box... That would have worked.
    Why do I always think of these things after the fact?${prompt}
  12394: '......${prompt}'
  12395: I really am a no-good fool...${prompt}
  12396: |-
    I finally went and retrieved the letters my friends and I had written to ourselves all those years ago.
    Can you guess what my letter said?${prompt}
  12397: |-
    “Don't ask me. It's up to you.”
    That's what I wrote.${prompt}
  12398: |-
    All the others had written such beautiful letters, full of the hope we were seeking during the war.
    “I want to be a valiant soldier.” “I want to be a gifted doctor who saves many lives.”
    Everyone else had dreams...everyone but me.${prompt}
  12399: |-
    I had no hopes or aspirations. I couldn't think of anything to write.
    So I just put it off and delayed making a decision for as long as possible...${prompt}
  12400: Back then I thought for sure that in the future I would be pursuing a noble dream, sure of myself at every step...${prompt}
  12401: |-
    And now look at me. Still with no dreams and just waiting for some kind of guidance from a letter I wrote so long ago...
    I haven't changed a bit.${prompt}
  12402: Well, that's all going to change from now on! M-my not changing, that is...${prompt}
  12403: |-
    Well, thanks for taking the time to listen to my woes.
    I'm sorry, but I have only this to offer you in gratitude.${prompt}
  12404: |-
    Wow! I never knew rolanberries could be so delicious!
    I feel like I've wasted my life having never known such flavor!${prompt}
  12405: |-
    Work? How can you talk about working at a time like this!?
    I'm eating here!${prompt}
  12406: |-
    It sure was the right call to bury those ${item-plural: 0[2]}.
    Look, I even had the foresight to bury two! Here you go. You can have one, free of charge.${prompt}
  12407: The time capsule? Oh, yes--I already made sure that everyone got their letter.${prompt}
  12408: |-
    I wonder where my letter got to...
    To be honest, I couldn't care less. Who needs dreams when you have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} as scrumptious as this! Mmm-mmm!${prompt}
  12409: Have you heard about those ghastly statues they're calling “maws?”${prompt}
  12410: |-
    They're like carvings of some monster with a huge, open mouth.
    Rumors say that if you stand in front of one, you feel like your soul is being devoured...${prompt}
  12411: Huh? You want me to pass this to Valeriano next time he's here?${prompt}
  12412: I certainly don't mind, but it looks like it won't be necessary. Look--${prompt}
  12413: Good day, Harmodios. I'm here with regard to the music sheets I requested the other day...${prompt}
  12414: "They're ready just like you asked, sir. \nBy the way, this young ${choice-player-gender}[gentleman/lady] here...${prompt}"
  12415: Ah yes, I remember. You're a dancer from Troupe Brilioth, are you not? How may I be of service?${prompt}
  12416: Absolutely splendid! Nothing would give me more pleasure than to perform with Troupe Brilioth!${prompt}
  12417: How I've longed to see...${prompt}
  12418: A-ahem. I will deliver the news to my troupe and have them prepare immediately. They are sure to be as excited as I am!${prompt}
  12419: I will see you again very soon. Please send my regards to Laila.${prompt}
  12420: A collaboration of circus and dance, huh? Now that's something I haven't seen since my childhood, before Troupe Valeriano disbanded after that unfortunate fire...${prompt}
  12421: Hello, how may I help you?${prompt}
  12422: Oh, a dancer, are you? Which troupe did you say you're from?${prompt}
  12423: Wh-wh-what!? From Troupe Brilioth!? Laila's Troupe Brilioth!?${prompt}
  12424: I am green with envy! I've been Laila's biggest fan for the past twenty years!${prompt}
  12425: |-
    You see, I'd dabbled in dancing once in the past.
    Unfortunately though, the powers that be didn't see it fit to bless me with rhythm...${prompt}
  12426: They did, however, bless me with these tailor's hands that can whip up garments that adorn their wearer with joy and happiness.${prompt}
  12427: I'm sorry for rambling like that. You came here to place an order, right?${prompt}
  12428: "Let me see... \nI can make you ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}"

    My station is to help along those new to the life of an adventurer in Vana'diel.
    I specialize in the types of fundamental knowledge necessary for success in such endeavors, as well as related methods of pedagogy.
    With my aid, you can rest assured that your first steps down the adventurer's path will not go astray.${prompt}
  12497: Should you still consider yourself a newcomer, I would highly recommend that you make full use of my services.${prompt}
  12498: |-
    This is my permanent post, and I never leave it. Remember it well.
    Whenever you need a hand with anything, anything at all, don't hesitate to come calling.${prompt}
  12499: |-
    Alors, êtes-vous intéressé par des tâches de niveau d'entrée pour vous mettre sur la voie de la grandeur ?
    Pas de souci, j'ai exactement ce qu'il vous faut !${prompt}
  12500: Allez parler au garde Aravoge juste là-bas et demandez-lui de vous jeter le sort “Signe”. Puis revenez me voir.${prompt}
  12501: Allez parler au garde Loup Rabide juste là-bas et demandez-lui de vous jeter le sort “Signe”. Puis revenez me voir.${prompt}
  12502: Allez parler à la garde Harara juste là-bas et demandez-lui de vous jeter le sort “Signe”. Puis revenez me voir.${prompt}
  12503: Eh bien, il semble que vous ayez pu obtenir votre Signe. Assez facile, non ?${prompt}
  12504: |-
    Tant que le Signe est actif, il y a toujours une possibilité que vous obteniez des cristaux de n'importe quel ennemi que vous défaites.
    Il y a aussi d'autres avantages plus concrets, comme une augmentation de la défense et de l'esquive.${prompt}
  12505: |-
    Le Signe vous aide même lorsque vous n'êtes pas engagé dans un combat avec un ennemi. Par exemple, il augmente le taux de guérison lorsque vous vous reposez.
    Pour toutes ces raisons et bien d'autres, vous devriez considérer qu'il est essentiel d'avoir le Signe jeté sur vous en tout temps.${prompt}
  12506: 'Eh bien, alors! En récompense de l’achèvement réussi de votre première mission, je voudrais vous présenter ces ${item-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  12507: |-
    Il y a plus ici que ce que l'on peut voir ! C'était une blague...
    Quoi qu'il en soit, c'est un type d'objet connu des aventuriers sous le nom de “repas”.
    Ce repas en particulier améliorera temporairement votre puissance d'attaque lorsque vous le mangerez.${prompt}
  12508: |-
    Chaque fois qu'un type de repas est consommé, vous recevrez un bonus de statut temporaire de ce genre.
    Naturellement, différents repas accordent différents types de bonus.${prompt}
  12509: |-
    Pour la plupart, les plats de viande affecteront la puissance d'attaque.
    À l'inverse, les plats de fruits de mer améliorent généralement la défense, et ainsi de suite.
    Faites attention à sélectionner des plats mieux adaptés à votre objectif.${prompt}
  12510: |-
    Une chose que vous devriez noter, cependant, c'est que vous ne pouvez pas manger un repas tant que le bonus de statut d'un autre repas est encore en vigueur.
    Votre estomac exploserait simplement !${prompt}
  12511: |-
    Hmmm, c'est pas mal à couvrir...
    Êtes-vous avec moi jusqu'à présent ?${prompt}
  12512: |-
    Ça se passe bien jusqu'ici ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Réexpliquez le Signe.
    Réexpliquez les repas.
    C'est un jeu d'enfant.${prompt}
  12513: |-
    Super ! Eh bien, parler ne prépare que jusqu'à un certain point. Passons directement aux choses sérieuses.
    Allez-y et croquez un de ces ${item-plural: 0[2]} !${prompt}
  12514: |-
    Après avoir mangé un repas, une icône de statut désignée comme “Nourriture” apparaîtra dans la partie supérieure gauche de votre écran.
    Revenez me parler une fois que vous aurez confirmé qu'elle est là.${prompt}
  12515: |-
    Regardez ce ventre plein ! Bien joué !
    Le Signe et les repas peuvent tous deux jouer des rôles cruciaux chaque fois que vous affrontez un type d'ennemi.
    C'est une leçon clé que vous feriez bien de ne pas oublier !${prompt}
  12516: |-
    Ensuite, mettons vos mains immaculées bien à salire !
    Pas question de laisser cette nourriture se perdre, n'est-ce pas ? Envoyons-vous combattre un monstre le ventre plein !${prompt}
  12517: Sortir par cette porte là-bas vous mènera dans une zone avec des ennemis hostiles.${prompt}
  12518: |-
    Essayez de cibler l'un des monstres puis sélectionnez l'option “Vérifier” dans votre menu.
    Cela vous aidera à évaluer le niveau de difficulté d'un ennemi et à vous assurer qu'il n'est pas trop fort. Un aventurier intelligent choisit ses ${choice-player-gender}[batailles].${prompt}
  12519: Soyez averti. Engager un ennemi qui est “très difficile” ou plus entraînera que votre Signe ne vous accorde pas les bonus de défense et d'esquive que vous auriez reçus autrement.${prompt}
  12520: Et cela nous amène à votre prochaine mission !${prompt}
  12521: Il est grand temps que vous appreniez à utiliser une “compétence d'arme” !${prompt}
  12522: Peut-être que vous avez déjà remarqué, mais parfois en combattant un ennemi, vos “compétences” augmentent petit à petit.${prompt}
  12523: Lorsque votre compétence avec l'arme que vous maniez atteint une valeur prédéterminée, les compétences d'arme deviendront disponibles à l'utilisation.${prompt}
  12524: |-
    « Combo » pour ceux qui sont habiles avec les armes de corps à corps. « Piqûre de guêpe » pour ceux qui se battent avec des dagues.
    « Coup rapide » pour ceux qui préfèrent l'épée.${prompt}
  12525: |-
    « Frappe éclatante » pour les manieurs de massue. « Frappe lourde » pour ceux qui prennent le bâton.
    Et ainsi de suite...${prompt}
  12526: |-
    Sélectionner « Statut » dans le menu principal affichera l'option « Compétences de combat ».
    Cela affichera toutes les valeurs de compétences actuelles dans toutes les catégories d'armes.${prompt}
  12527: |-
    La première compétence d'arme pour chaque type d'arme peut être apprise à une valeur de compétence de 5.
    Fixe-toi cela comme premier objectif, et nous partirons de là !${prompt}
  12528: |-
    Ohhh ! Quelqu'un est allé apprendre une nouvelle compétence d'arme, n'est-ce pas ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle] ?
    Très bien !${prompt}
  12529: |-
    Je peux voir à l'éclat dans tes yeux que tu l'as déjà utilisée sur une pauvre créature malchanceuse, mais je vais expliquer un peu plus.
    Chaque fois que tes « Points tactiques » (PT) atteignent 1000 ou plus, sélectionner « Capacités » puis « Compétence d'arme » dans le menu affichera une liste de compétences d'arme utilisables.${prompt}
  12530: |-
    Ce sont des techniques mortelles capables de causer d'énormes dégâts aux ennemis.
    Il vaut vraiment la peine pour un aventurier de les apprendre et de les maîtriser.${prompt}
  12531: Ah, au fait, as-tu eu la chance de recevoir des objets des monstres que tu as combattus ?${prompt}
  12532: |-
    Si tu as eu la chance de trouver des ${item-plural: 0[2]}, assure-toi de les garder.
    Ils pourraient rapporter des dividendes plus tard...${prompt}
  12533: |-
    Aussi, cela me rappelle. Il y a une autre leçon qui est mieux apprise tôt que tard.
    Les objets que tu ne manqueras pas de croiser, connus sous le nom de « cristaux », tels que ${item-plural: 1[2]} et ${item-plural: 2[2]}, sont extrêmement importants.${prompt}
  12534: |-
    Ce sont des objets vraiment polyvalents qui peuvent être utilisés à plusieurs fins.
    Cela inclut les échanger avec des gardes contre certaines récompenses, et les vendre pour gagner de l'argent, pour ne nommer que quelques exemples.${prompt}
  12535: Pour l'instant, j'aimerais expliquer davantage sur une autre de leurs utilisations. À savoir, le rôle qu'ils jouent dans la « synthèse ».${prompt}
  12536: |-
    Mais d'abord, les choses sérieuses. Ta récompense pour avoir complété ta dernière mission ! Te voilà, alors.
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, et enfin, mais non des moindres, ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}
  12537: |-
    Maintenant, en utilisant ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}, l'interface de synthèse s'affichera.
    Une fois là-bas, sélectionne ${item-singular: 1[2]} et ${item-singular: 2[2]} comme ingrédients à ajouter.${prompt}
  12538: Tout ce qui reste à faire est de sélectionner l'option « OK », et la synthèse commencera !${prompt}
  12539: |-
    Tu constateras que le processus de fabrication ne commencera jamais si les ingrédients que tu as sélectionnés ne forment pas une recette de synthèse viable.
    De plus, même lorsque tes matériaux sont corrects, il y a toujours une chance que ta synthèse échoue, alors fais attention.${prompt}
  12540: La majorité des objets que tu crées par synthèse, ainsi que la plupart de ceux qui sont lâchés par les ennemis que tu as vaincus, peuvent être placés sur la « Maison de vente aux enchères » pour être vendus.${prompt}
  12541: La maison de vente aux enchères est un lieu ultra-consommateur où tu peux essayer d'acheter les marchandises d'autres joueurs en plaçant des enchères, ainsi que permettre à d'autres joueurs d'enchérir sur les objets que tu as mis en vente.${prompt}
  12542: |-
    Mes mots à eux seuls ne rendent pas justice à la vaste corne d'abondance de biens qu'est la maison de vente aux enchères.
    Il faut simplement le voir de ses propres yeux.${prompt}
  12543: |-
    Are you still with me?
    ${selection-lines}
    Explain synthesis again.
    Explain the auction house again.
    Sure am.${prompt}
  12544: Somewhere in this great city lies our nation's auction house. Seek it out, and report back to me when you have found it.${prompt}
  12545: |-
    You needn't worry about going through with an actual purchase.
    Simply examining any of the “Auction Counters” will more than suffice.${prompt}
  12546: |-
    So, you were able to locate the auction house!
    Pretty hard to miss, isn't it?${prompt}
  12547: |-
    What do you think? It is as I said, yes? Few organizations in this world exceed the auction house in scale.
    It will never cease to be of use to you throughout your adventures. It would be wise to become adept at using it.${prompt}
  12548: |-
    And now down to brass tacks!
    Let's see if we can't get you to up some levels!${prompt}
  12549: There are several items in existence which serve to enhance the number of experience points you receive for defeating enemies.${prompt}
  12550: 'For example, there are ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and ${item-plural: 2[2]}, just to name a few.${prompt}'
  12551: These are a bit unique in that you must wait a certain amount of time after equipping them before you may use them.${prompt}
  12552: |-
    There is also a predetermined amount of time, usually quite long, that must pass before these items can be used again.
    The total number of times you may use any single item is also limited, so be mindful of that as well.${prompt}
  12553: |-
    Many of these items may be obtained from the same guards that provide you with Signet.
    You need only exchange “Conquest Points” in order to acquire them.${prompt}
  12554: |-
    As a matter of fact, for finishing that last assignment, I'm going to give you this ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.
    With this, you'll be able to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} without having to use any of your Conquest Points.${prompt}
  12555: |-
    Head over to any guard and have a go at exchanging them for something.
    And after that, see if you can't make it all the way up to level four.
    I'll be right here waiting for you when you get back.${prompt}
  12556: |-
    With an experience bonus in place, it should take you practically no time at all.
    Good luck, and be careful! It can get quite hairy out there!${prompt}
  12557: |-
    Well, well, well! We might make an adventurer out of you just yet!
    Looks like we've almost washed all that green off of you.${prompt}
  12558: |-
    A bit of bad news now, though.
    Starting from level 31, anytime you are knocked unconscious your experience points will suffer a deduction.${prompt}
  12559: |-
    As a general rule, the amount penalized will be about 10% of the total amount required to reach the next level.
    You have to be more careful than ever from here on out!${prompt}
  12560: However, there are ways to minimize this loss of experience points.${prompt}
  12561: |-
    Like this, for example. Go on, take it. Your reward for reaching level four.
    It's called ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  12562: |-
    Using this will grant you a status known as “Reraise.”
    Whenever you are rendered unconscious while this effect is in place, you will have the option to revive yourself.${prompt}
  12563: |-
    Choosing to do so will cause you to be resuscitated in the very spot where you have fallen.
    In addition, as I stated previously, the amount of experience points you lose will be somewhat lessened.${prompt}
  12564: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and similar items work in the same manner as the ${item-plural: 1[2]} and the other experience bonus items I mentioned earlier.
    That is, once equipped, you must wait a certain period of time before they can be used, and there are both cooldown timers and limited charges as well.${prompt}
  12565: |-
    All of these items as a whole are collectively referred to as “enchanted items.”
    There is a vast array of other enchanted items with myriad other effects that will prove useful on your adventures.
    It may be worth the time and effort to better acquaint yourself with them at some point.${prompt}
  12566: |-
    It seems you're starting to get the hang of things.
    Next, I'd like for you to go and fight some enemies in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon].${prompt}
  12567: '${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/The Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] is located beyond the ${choice: 2}[southern/northern/northern] reaches of ${choice: 2}[West Ronfaure/North Gustaberg/East Sarutabaruta].${prompt}'
  12568: |-
    You're sure to encounter some new monsters there that you won't find prowling around the outskirts of the city.
    It may be a bit daunting, so I'll only require that you slay one such beast, and then head on back.${prompt}
  12569: |-
    Just keep in mind, the farther you stray from the city, the more ferocious monsters tend to be.
    Don't say I didn't warn you.${prompt}
  12570: |-
    Make sure to use the “Check” command to determine the strength of your enemy.
    If you find that you are surrounded by enemies too difficult for you, try heading back to a previous area closer to the city and leveling up a bit more first.${prompt}
  12571: |-
    I know those smells...
    You smell of victory! And of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon]! Good on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12572: But by now you must be getting sick and tired of fighting the same old monsters so close to the city walls, aren't you?${prompt}
  12573: If you are several levels beyond a monster and totally outclass them in every respect, checking them will yield a “too weak to be worthwhile” result.${prompt}
  12574: Killing monsters so far beneath you is borderline cowardice, and will net you no experience points.${prompt}
  12575: If you start to notice more and more of these “too weak” monsters around you, consider moving farther from the city to a more difficult area.${prompt}
  12576: |-
    Congratulations on another milestone! Reward tiiime!
    You've just earned yourself ${number: 0} experience points, hotshot.${prompt}
  12577: Let's dive right into your next assignment while that blood is still pumping!${prompt}
  12578: |-
    I'm going to up the stakes here a little bit, ${name-player}. But it's for your own good.
    I want you to go out and get all the way to level ten.${prompt}
  12579: |-
    Considering your current level and the knowledge you have, you shouldn't confine yourself to the immediate vicinity of the city.
    You're more than capable of besting monsters in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] at this point.${prompt}
  12580: |-
    I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. So how's it feel? You're moving on up in the world.
    Time to put some money in those pockets. A ${number: 1}-gil reward, just for you. Don't spend it all in one place.${prompt}
  12581: By now you should be relatively familiar with the basics of battle. Am I right or am I right?${prompt}
  12582: |-
    But don't go getting too cocky!
    This world is chock-full of monsters just waiting for the opportune moment to pounce and knock you out cold!${prompt}
  12583: |-
    Depending on the type of monster, there are several factors that could cause them to attack you without provocation.
    I'll enumerate some of the more common types of this blatantly aggressive behavior for you.${prompt}
  12584: For starters, and most obviously, there are monsters which detect by sight. They will attack you whenever you enter their field of vision. This is the most prevalent type. They simply cannot stand the sight of adventurers.${prompt}
  12585: |-
    Next, there are those monsters which detect by sound. They can be a bit more dangerous than visually-dependent monsters, in that they will attack the source of any sound within a certain prescribed radius.
    You may not think it, but there are a great many monsters whose aural senses are far more developed than their sense of sight.${prompt}
  12586: |-
    There are also monsters which detect their enemies' spellcasting. Much like the sound-detecting types, these monsters will attack the source of any magic casting within a certain radius of their being.
    Not surprisingly, many monsters in the arcana family rely heavily on this method of detection, which covers a comparatively larger range than the aforementioned sense of hearing.${prompt}
  12587: |-
    And finally, there are opportunistic monsters which prey upon the weak and near-dead, pinpointing their prey by detecting low hit points.
    The family of undead creatures abound in monsters of this type. Even more distressing, the fewer the hit points you have, the farther the distance from which you can be detected.${prompt}
  12588: Your next assignment will attempt to familiarize you with these detection methods, and train you to become adept at avoiding them.${prompt}
  12589: 'I want you to travel once again to ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], and retrieve an item known as a “Gate Crystal.”${prompt}'
  12590: 'Near the center of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], you will find a large, white, almost otherworldly structure. On the area map, it is labeled as the ${choice: 2}[Crag of Holla/Crag of Dem/Crag of Mea].${prompt}'
  12591: |-
    There you will find one of an enormous series of crystals known as “Telepoints.”
    Simply examine the telepoint you find there, and bring back your findings.${prompt}
  12592: 'Only when you present your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to me shall your assignment be complete.${prompt}'
  12593: |-
    Exercise the utmost caution. There are many extremely dangerous monsters in the area you will be visiting.
    And take extra care not to draw the attention of any beastmen.${prompt}
  12594: |-
    This shall be your final assignment.
    Go now, and may the Goddess watch over you.${prompt}
  12595: |-
    Ahhh, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, just as I requested.
    Excellent work, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12596: |-
    And now for some information regarding this little beauty.
    As long as you have this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, you will be able to be transported by the appropriate spell of teleportation directly to the telepoint from which you retrieved it.${prompt}
  12597: I doubt that you will have many opportunities to use it for the time being, but you would do well to remember what I have said.${prompt}
  12598: |-
    Several such telepoints exist, scattered throughout Vana'diel.
    Each has its own specific gate crystal, which you will receive the first time that you examine any of them.${prompt}
  12599: |-
    Let me take this time to offer you a most heartfelt congratulations, ${name-player}!
    You have successfully completed all of the assignments I have laid before you.${prompt}
  12600: 'And here I have a most fitting reward for you. A gift of ${number: 1} experience points, and ${number: 3} ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  12601: |-
    I fear that I have nothing more to teach you.
    From now on, your lessons will best be learned by giving a mindful ear to others and being ever observant on your travels.${prompt}
  12602: Do remember, though, that the paths open before you will multiply greatly should you cooperate with other adventurers.${prompt}
  12603: |-
    Leveling, for example, is an endeavor made immeasurably more efficient and enjoyable in the company of others.
    It helps to not only guarantee you some modicum of safety in numbers, but also rewards you with considerably more experience points than adventuring alone.${prompt}
  12604: |-
    I suppose it does require a good deal of courage to approach an adventurer you do not know, but I strongly encourage you to do so.
    It may prove to be the beginning of an extremely rewarding and long-lasting friendship.${prompt}
  12605: |-
    There may still be some small facets of adventuring that I can continue to offer you advice on.
    Should you ever have any questions or anxieties, please do not hesitate to come and see me again.
    I will do my best to be of service and set your heart at ease.${prompt}
  12606: Go now, and go well. The world awaits its next great adventurer, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12607: |-
    Good day to you! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service.
    Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
  12608: |-
    Good day to you! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.
    Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
  12609: |-
    Good day to you! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service..
    Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
  12610: |-
    What will you ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nothing just now.
    Search comments.
    Skillchains.
    Magic bursts.
    Skillchains and elements.${prompt}
  12611: Just as their name implies, search comments are original messages composed by adventurers which are readily visible to others when using the search function.${prompt}
  12612: |-
    There are several different categories of search comments.
    These include, but are not limited to, “EXP Party,” “Items,” and “Missions and Quests.”${prompt}
  12613: Opening the “Search” function from the Main Menu and then selecting the “Comment” option will allow you to conduct a player search by comment type.${prompt}
  12614: For example, if you would like to search for other players to form a leveling party, you need only select “EXP Party” from the list displayed.${prompt}
  12615: Conversely, if you would like to advertise yourself as interested in being on the receiving end of an experience party invite, you can choose the “Edit Comment” command from the Search menu.${prompt}
  12616: |-
    Of course, search comment composition differs from person to person.
    You might want to conduct a search first to see what type of search comments are considered the norm before writing your own.${prompt}
  12617: Skillchains are devastating elemental phenomena which manifest themselves when weapon skills are carried out in a precise and well-timed order. ${prompt}
  12618: The very natures of the skillchains themselves differ widely, being dependent upon the weapon skills used and the order of their execution.${prompt}
  12619: To take a simple and timeless example, using the weapon skill “Red Lotus Blade” immediately after “Fast Blade” will yield a type of skillchain known as “Liquefaction.”${prompt}
  12620: Furthermore, adding a “Combo” after the liquefaction effect will produce a more advanced “Fusion” skillchain.${prompt}
  12621: |-
    In the taxonomy of skillchains, each type is related to one or more specific elements.
    Liquefaction is bound to the element of fire, for example, and fusion to both fire and light.${prompt}
  12622: Another crucial point, which I simply cannot emphasize enough, is the importance of timing in the execution of skillchains.${prompt}
  12623: |-
    One must not be too overzealous, but too much patience can also be damning.
    It is most ideal to time the latter weapon skill to begin just a second or two after the preceding one is complete.${prompt}
  12624: |-
    The possible weapon skill sequences and the different skillchains they yield are highly variegated.
    It is said of this time-tested battle art that it “takes a moment to learn, and a lifetime to master.”${prompt}
  12625: |-
    Magic bursts are another type of supernatural phenomena which occur after carefully selected and impeccably timed spells are cast following a skillchain. Such spells exceed their typical counterparts in that they are enhanced in both power and accuracy.
    You will commonly see magic bursts abbreviated as “MB.”${prompt}
  12626: Magic bursts will not take place if the element of the spell being cast does not match the element of the skillchain preceding it.${prompt}
  12627: To take an example, a detonation skillchain, which has wind as its element, followed by an aero or other like spell, will generate a magic burst.${prompt}
  12628: In the same vein, thunder, or any cognate spell, would result in a magic burst should it follow an impaction skillchain, itself deriving power from that very element.${prompt}
  12629: As I said previously, some skillchains are associated with more than one element. Take fragmentation, for example. It is composed of equal parts wind and thunder. So chasing a fragmentation skillchain with any type of aero or thunder spell would create a magic burst.${prompt}
  12630: The key to mastering magic bursts lies in learning the elemental attributes of both the skillchains you create as well as the magic you wield. The rest is simply a matter of timing.${prompt}
  12631: For your convenience, I will go over the elemental attributes of all skillchain types. Pay close attention.${prompt}
  12632: |-
    Level 1 Skillchain (Associated element):
    Transfixion (Light), Liquefaction (Fire), Detonation (Wind),
    Impaction (Thunder), Induration (Ice), Reverberation (Water),
    Scission (Earth), Compression (Darkness).${prompt}
  12633: |-
    Level 2 Skillchain (Associated elements):
    Fusion (Light/Fire), Fragmentation (Wind/Thunder),
    Distortion (Ice/Water), Gravitation (Earth/Darkness).${prompt}

    Level 3 Skillchain (Associated elements):
    Light (Light/Fire/Wind/Thunder),
    Darkness (Ice/Water/Earth/Darkness).${prompt}

  12638: Now, run along and immerse yourself in the revelry, kupo!${prompt}

  12641: If you're interested, I can exchange all the tokens you have for a grand gift of galactic proportion, kupo! Well, perhaps that's exaggerating things a tad.${prompt}
  12642: Of course, it's perfectly permissible to use them one at time. The decision is entirely yours, kupo!${prompt}

    For this year's Starlight Celebration, we moogles have set ourselves a challenge: breaking the all-Vana'diel present-distribution record!
    But we couldn't possibly dream of succeeding at such an ambitious undertaking just by ourselves, kupo.${prompt}
  12648: We could really do with some adventurer-offered assistance. Would you be interested in lending a hand in this noble endeavor, in the spirit of giving, kupo?${prompt}

  12651: |-
    You've made this little moogle very happy, kupo!
    Now then, let's not waste any time. We'd like you to deliver these presents here.${prompt}
  12652: Report back to us after you've completed your task, kupo.${prompt}
  12653: Also, we don't mind you working in a group if you feel lonesome doing the deliveries on your own. Just form a party and have everyone come talk to us.${prompt}
  12654: And I have to warn you, presents can't be taken to other areas, kupo. Be careful, okay?${prompt}
  12655: Happy delivering, kupo!${prompt}
  12656: Wow, you've delivered every single present! Thank you so much, kupo!${prompt}
  12657: Here's a little something for your kindness.${prompt}
  12658: You want to help us again? That's very kind of you, but we need more time to put together a new set of presents, kupo. Would you mind coming back tomorrow?${prompt}
  12659: |-
    Kupo ho ho! Merry Starlight!
    As with past celebrations, we've prepared a veritable mountain of presents for all adventurers, kupo.${prompt}
  12660: We'd appreciate your help in distributing the presents. What say you?${prompt}

  12664: 'Let'' see... This addressee of this card is a ${choice: 0}[male Hume/female Hume/male Elvaan/female Elvaan/male Tarutaru/female Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] adventurer, kupo.${prompt}'
  12665: Are you trying to pull a fast one, kupo!? This card isn't yours to give, nor is it addressed to you, so please take it back to where you found it.${prompt}
  12666: |-
    Ah, you've brought us a card!
    Here's a present in exchange for it, kupo.${prompt}
  12667: We'd also appreciate your help in distributing cards, kupo. All you're required to do is deliver this card to the addressee. We're counting on you!${prompt}

  12735: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  12736: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  12737: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  12738: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  12739: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  12740: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  12741: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  12742: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  12743: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  12744: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  12745: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  12746: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  12747: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  12748: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  12749: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12750: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  12751: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  12752: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  12753: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  12754: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  12755: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  12756: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  12757: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  12758: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12759: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  12760: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  12761: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  12762: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  12763: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  12764: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  12765: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  12766: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  12767: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  12768: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  12769: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  12770: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  12771: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  12772: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  12773: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  12774: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  12775: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  12776: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  12777: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  12778: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  12779: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  12780: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  12781: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  12782: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  12783: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  12784: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  12785: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  12786: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  12787: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  12788: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  12789: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  12790: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  12791: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  12792: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  12793: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  12794: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  12795: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  12796: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  12797: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12798: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  12799: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  12800: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  12801: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  12802: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  12803: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  12804: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  12805: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  12806: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  12807: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  12808: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  12809: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  12810: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  12811: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  12812: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  12813: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  12814: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  12815: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  12816: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  12817: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  12818: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}

    Oh, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too!
    What skills does it require? Let's see here...${prompt}
  12834: |-
    Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!
    Ain't synergy grand?${prompt}
  12835: |-
    Wait! No, don't tell me.
    You strike me as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.${prompt}

    A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living.
    Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.${prompt}
  12838: |-
    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  12839: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  12840: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  12841: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  12842: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  12843: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  12844: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  12845: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  12846: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  12847: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  12848: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}
  12849: |-
    An aspiring synergist, I see!
    If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt}

    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.

  12883: 'To make use of my services, first you''ll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt}'
  12884: Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt}
  12885: You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt}
  12886: Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt}

    Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.
    I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt}

    Invisible to you, at least.
    It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt}
  12889: When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt}
  12890: |-
    I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.
    Simple as that, kupo!${prompt}
  12891: |-
    What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!
    Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt}
  12892: |-
    Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.
    So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt}
  12893: For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt}
  12894: |-
    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!
    It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt}
  12895: Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt}
  12896: |-
    If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!
    No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
    Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}
  12897: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt}
  12898: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt}

    Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul.
    Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  12959: By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.${prompt}
  12960: 'At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}'
  12961: Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.${prompt}
  12962: That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.${prompt}
  12963: From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.${prompt}
  12964: But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.${prompt}
  12965: The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}
  12966: |-
    Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all.
    As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.${prompt}
  12967: We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.${prompt}
  12968: 'Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level ${number: 0}. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.${prompt}'
  12969: |-
    Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands.

  13775: 'While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.${prompt}'
  13776: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.${prompt}
  13777: As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.${prompt}
  13778: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.${prompt}
  13779: To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.${prompt}

    These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team.

  13786: That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.${prompt}
  13787: The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call “Voidwalkers.”${prompt}
  13788: Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  13789: Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.${prompt}
  13790: 'Possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}'
  13791: It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.${prompt}
  13792: You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.${prompt}
  13793: Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}
  13794: In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.${prompt}
  13795: The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.${prompt}
  13796: When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  13797: Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.${prompt}
  13798: However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.${prompt}
  13799: Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.${prompt}
  13800: Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.${prompt}
  13801: But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the “existential spectrum.”${prompt}
  13802: |-
    You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned.
    In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.${prompt}
  13803: The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.${prompt}
  13804: To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  13805: Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  13806: Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.${prompt}
  13807: One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items,” while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  13808: Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.${prompt}
  13809: All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.${prompt}
  13810: Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.${prompt}
  13811: For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.${prompt}
  13812: In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.${prompt}
  13813: Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.${prompt}
  13814: If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.${prompt}
  13815: |-
    Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company.
    It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.${prompt}
  13816: Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.${prompt}
  13817: Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.${prompt}
  13818: Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.${prompt}
  13819: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are representative of such items.
    They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.${prompt}
  13820: (Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)${prompt}
  13821: They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  13822: Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.${prompt}
  13823: Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.${prompt}
  13824: 'Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.${prompt}'
  13825: |-
    Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding.
    But I digress...${prompt}
  13826: Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.${prompt}
  13827: |-
    As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch.
    Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.${prompt}
  13828: It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  13829: |-
    Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong.
    Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.${prompt}
  13830: Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.${prompt}
  13831: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch''s Jeuno-based research wing.${prompt}'
  13832: Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.${prompt}
  13833: The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.${prompt}
  13834: I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.${prompt}
  13835: I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.${prompt}
  13836: Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?${prompt}
  13837: Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.${prompt}
  13838: |-
    Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them.
    Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!${prompt}
  13839: And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.${prompt}
  13840: |-
    I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really.
    Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.${prompt}
  13841: |-
    As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray.
    Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...${prompt}
  13842: Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.${prompt}
  13843: |-
    Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing.
    There exists another: stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  13844: |-
    Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite.
    Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.${prompt}
  13845: |-
    Are you familiar with ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1}?
    Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.${prompt}
  13846: |-
    As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch.
    Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.${prompt}
  13847: |-
    The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust.
    Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me?
    Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.${prompt}
  13848: |-
    At any rate, should you manage to obtain any ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1} in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me.
    Simple enough, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  13849: Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt}
  13850: Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.${prompt}
  13851: If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.${prompt}
  13852: |-
    Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land.
    The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  13853: By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.${prompt}
  13854: Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.${prompt}
  13855: Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.${prompt}
  13856: Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  13857: Keep this fact in mind at all times.${prompt}
  13858: It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.${prompt}
  13859: If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...${prompt}
  13860: Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}
  13861: While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.${prompt}
  13862: |-
    As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants.
    There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.${prompt}
  13863: Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.${prompt}
  13864: |-
    Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite.
    If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.${prompt}
  13865: As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.${prompt}
  13866: Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.${prompt}
  13867: Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called “periapt”--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt}
  13868: Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.${prompt}

  13953: What am I saying!? This is hardly the time for gleeful greetings or alliterative addresses, kupo!${prompt}
  13954: |-
    Even as we speak, overzealous Goblins are partaking not just in the Starlight Celebration spirit, but others' precious presents!
    These Gobbies bear no bad blood, but their covetous capers are the cause of much consternation, kupo.${prompt}
  13955: |-
    And to make matters worse, they've even filched the furnishings the MHMU ordered from the guilds...
    I know the saying, “If you give a Goblin goulash...” but this is just rikupulous!${prompt}
  13956: |-
    Please, ${name-player}, I beseech you!
    Find the Goblins traipsing about town and teach them the meaning of private property once and for all!
    (By affably asking them to relinquish what they requisitioned, kupo.)${prompt}
  13957: |-
    It may seem like the MHMU is just exploiting the nearest adventurer, but nay! You--and only you--are capable of restoring resplendence and revelry to the realm.
    Now go forth and fulfill the festive fate we thrust upon you, kupo!${prompt}
  13958: |-
    Kupopopo!
    Have you forgotten your merry mission already? Get giddy, gift-grabbing Goblins around town to give back people's goods, then go gab to a Moogle when you're done.${prompt}
  13959: |-
    And remember, Gobbies like to stick their noses in other creatures' business, if you know what I mean.
    Snuff out your smell so they can't sense your spoils, kupo.${prompt}
  13960: |-
    And remember, Goblins go cuckoo for comestibles, kupo.
    Offer them their favorite food, for they should forget you even exist.${prompt}
  13961: |-
    And remember, Goblins just want to jump for joy and jubilation at this jocular time of year.
    Bequeath beastmen bills or bedazzling bijoux to them and you may find yourself furnished with furnishings in return, kupo.${prompt}
  13962: |-
    Great glorious Goddess, you've managed to procure a present! Praise be to your positively prodigious persistence!
    ...And your altruistic attitude after you return it to its rightful remitter, kupo!${prompt}
  13963: |-
    It looks like this gift is from someone named ${entity: 0}. Seek out the sender and start spreading some Starlight spirit, kupo!
    Oh, and watch out for mischievous Goblin mitts, my little gofer--I mean adventurer!${prompt}
  13964: |-
    Wonderful work, warden of weal!
    However, since giving is greater than receiving, how about giving ${entity: 0} word that you were able to deliver the present?${prompt}
  13965: |-
    The considerable amount of charity you've shown complete strangers cannot be overstated, kupo.
    Without your magnanimity, moxie, and master mediation skills, this year's Starlight Celebration would have been a much dimmer affair.${prompt}
  13966: |-
    Yet to polish this party to the point of pristine luster, more Goblins must be taught the difference between naughty and nice!
    Remember, once you give back a gift, seal the deal by simply sauntering over to the nearest moogle.
    We're counting on you, kupo!${prompt}
  13967: The MHMU humbly offers you this token of our thanks, not only for making the world a brighter place, but for tolerating our moogle mummery and the voluminous vats of verbosity that violated your virgin ears.${prompt}
  13968: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! I forgot those festive Gobbies are still frolicking with our furnishings, kupo!${prompt}
  13969: |-
    I'm so sorry to solicit further favors from you, but could you kindly retrieve those as well?
    Pretty please with paprika on top? You wouldn't want to keep us from rewarding the good boys and girls of Vana'diel, would you, kupo?${prompt}
  13970: |-
    Kupo ho ho! Do my deteriorating eyes deceive me, or is that one of the furnishings we ordered?
    We'd planned on giving them all to needy orphans, but you've done so much for the MHMU recently, why don't you have this one? 'Tis the season, so they say.${prompt}
  13971: |-
    What an astounding accomplishment, as expected of an adventurer like you!
    We are eternally grateful for the copious kindnesses you've conferred upon us, kupo.${prompt}
  13972: |-
    Word around the union fountain is that other nations' furnishings still remain at large. Would it be too terrible a torment to traipse around town--peepers peeled for gregarious Gobbies ogling purported presents--the next time you visit another nation?
    The MHMU would be forever in your debt, kupo.${prompt}
  13973: (Wheeew, way to whisk that one under the rug. I could never tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] that we got distracted by the dazzling decorations and had the furnishings nabbed from nigh under our noses!)${prompt}
  13974: Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?♪
  13975: |-
    Ev'ry girl, ev'ry boy, ev'rybody, happy toy!
    Me nose holes smell the joy,
    The joy from happy toy!
    Wheeere cooould iiit beee?♪
  13976: |-
    This for me? In-doo-bid-ably!
    Could be gooder, but it not bad.
  13977: |-
    Waaah! It you!
    You give yum-yums for me tum-tum. Good ${choice-player-gender}[guy/girl]!
  13978: |-
    Not for us, not for me?
    I give it back. Now you happy?
    Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?♪
  13979: |-
    No no no no no!
    Go away! Nose holes busy sniff for happy toy!
  13980: '...'
  13981: You have friend, you do? We Gobbies have friend too.
  13982: Yum-yums for me? Gobbies remember...till our tummies go rumble-rumble again.
  13983: |-
    For me!? Why give so nice thing to me!?
    Me so happy head go boom! So boom!
    But first, me need give happy toy to you too.
  13984: |-
    Happy toy? For me?
    Why you give so good thing to me?
    But no can take. Me have no happy toy for you.
  13985: |-
    Blech. What this yucky thing?
    It make me want upgut food. Take it away.
  13986: |-
    What? But how...?
    If that's truly from ${entity: 0}, that must mean...you stole it and you're ransoming it back to me!
    If you think for one moment that I'd pay scum like you, you'd best think twice!${prompt}
  13987: |-
    Oh, I see. My apologies.
    How silly of me. Everyone knows how mischievous Goblins get during the Starlight Celebration season. I read somewhere that it's got something to do with the moon and the tides or whatnot.${prompt}
  13988: |-
    Anyway, sorry to trouble you, but could you deliver this in my stead?
    I may look like a strapping young lad, but I have this illness that prevents me from doing the same task twice in one day. Quite troublesome, really.${prompt}
  13989: |-
    Also, could you do me a favor and report back to me after you're done?
    I didn't want to spend the extra gil for delivery confirmation with times as tough as they are, you know?${prompt}
  13990: |-
    I take it you delivered my present safe and sound?
    Oh, and it was well received, too? Ha, you didn't need to tell me that, for my gifts are always a hit.
    I guess I should thank you though, seeing as how you played a tiny part in my Starlight Celebration success.${prompt}
  13991: |-
    Waaah, a cutthroat! Take anything you want, just not my lucky chocobo hose, please! I...
    Wait, isn't that the gift I sent ${entity: 0}? You didn't steal that too, did you!?${prompt}
  13992: |-
    What!? You...valiantly wrested it from the clutches of a greedy Goblin so you could return it to me?
    I just knew my ${choice-player-gender}[handsome champion/fair handmaiden] in resplendent regalia would come some day!${prompt}
  13993: |-
    I'm sure you've been through quite a few trials and tribulations just getting this back to me, your fair lady. However, my hands are tied at the moment and I can't take this present to ${entity: 0}.
    Therefore, I command you, my loyal follower, to act as my liaison and deliver it unscathed. I have no doubt that you'll succeed, since a ${choice-player-gender}[knight/handmaiden] will do anything to serve and protect ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] mistress.${prompt}
  13994: And please don't forget to check in with me after the delivery is made. Every ${choice-player-gender}[champion/handmaiden] knows that's the ${choice-player-gender}[chivalrous/proper] thing to do.${prompt}
  13995: |-
    How fared your journey, my ${choice-player-gender}[courageous champion/humble handmaiden]?
    Oh, I simply knew I could place my complete trust in you! You've not only made your fair lady quite proud, but saved the Starlight Celebration from those covetous beastmen! Oh, joyous day!${prompt}
  13996: 'I beg your pardon, but I cannot help but notice that this is the parcel I sent to ${entity: 0}. How might you have come by it?${prompt}'
  13997: |-
    Ah, I see. Those Goblin rapscallions still show a complete and utter disregard for social graces, would you not agree?
    At any rate, you seem to possess a rather strong sense of justice, and for that I am most grateful.${prompt}
  13998: 'Could you also find it within your heart to see that this package reaches ${entity: 0} safely? I may be a man of humble means, but you will certainly have my eternal gratitude and undying admiration.${prompt}'
  13999: |-
    Oh my. This utterly slipped my addled mind.
    I am truly sorry, but I fear I must heap one more request upon your already burdened back. Could you please report back to me after you've made the delivery?
    It would undoubtedly lessen the anxiety weighing down my fragile heart.${prompt}
  14000: |-
    Goddess be good, you have returned! And with favorable tidings, no?
    Splendid. Absolutely splendid. Thanks to you, I feel as if I could burst into a Starlight carol at any moment. Fa-la-la-la～♪.${prompt}
  14001: |-
    What doth bring thee 'fore these rheumy eyes, orbs that pierce the soul and a stranger's guise?
    Harken, thou hast ${entity: 0}'s present, from whom hast thou received such consent?${prompt}
  14002: |-
    'Tis an entertaining tale with which thy jowls doth flail,
    A tale of Goblins run amok, and wretched me bereft of luck.
    Still, thanks are in store for completing this chore with a dearth of gore.${prompt}
  14003: |-
    While these next words may conjure a storm, I cannot assist thee in any form.
    Thus, I entreat thee to heed the call...deliver this gift to ${entity: 0} once and for all!${prompt}
  14004: |-
    'Fore I finish this lengthy tirade, one last request must be made.
    Once the gift hath changed hands, return at once for further plans.${prompt}
  14005: |-
    Thou hast safely returned from thy trial? Upon us both doth Altana smile!
    To thee, the savior of the Starlight Celebration, I do give heartfelt acclamations!${prompt}
  14006: |-
    Wh-wh-what have you got there? It looks awfully-wafully like the gift I gave to ${entity: 0}.
    Did something happen? P-p-please don't tell me that ${entity: 0} passy-wassed away!${prompt}
  14007: |-
    ...It was just a G-g-goblin prank?
    Sorry to overreactaru. I had a t-t-traumatic experience last Starlight Devastation--er, Celebration! So now I always feary-wear the worst.
    By the way, th-th-thank you for getting my gift back.${prompt}
  14008: 'As you can guess, m-m-my comfort zone is rather itty-bitty. I know you must be expired--tired! But can you please helpy-welp me and deliver my present to ${entity: 0}?${prompt}'
  14009: |-
    After you pass on--the gift! Pass the gift on! Then c-c-could you report back to me?
    I truly-wuly want to know how ${entity: 0} reacts.${prompt}
  14010: |-
    Ah, you're back!
    It's ${entity: 0}'s most perished, er, cherished possession, you say? Wh-wh-what lofty-wofty praise!
    I can't thank you enough for your c-c-contributions, adventurer.${prompt}
  14011: |-
    So many nasty-wasty things happened to me today, I'm just too moody-woody to listen to your blather!
    Begone before I--wait, isn't that my present to ${entity: 0}?${prompt}
  14012: Ugh, quit barking like a bog dog, ${choice-player-gender}[brother-wother/sister-wister]! I don't give a ham and cheese about giddy Goblins or lazy moogles.${prompt}
  14013: |-
    You think you're so great because you saved my present from some baddie-waddies? Bah humbug-wumbug!
    If you're gonna stick your nosey-wose in others' business, then you bettaru finish what you started!
    You'll be taking that gift on over to ${entity: 0}, I tell you what!${prompt}
  14014: |-
    And don't think for a minute-winute that I'm going to let you get away with ruining my day! Report back here for a tongue-lashing when you're done!
    Now get going before I gutaru you right here and now!${prompt}
  14015: |-
    Hmph, so you're stupid as well as rude? Are you so subservient that you'd actually come backy-wack for a beating?
    Get out of my face! You disgustaru me. Oh, and Merry Starlight!${prompt}
  14016: 'Hey, I sent that to ${entity: 0}. Why do you have it?${prompt}'
  14017: |-
    Hmmm. Stolen by Gobbies, huh?
    Thanks for getting it back.${prompt}
  14018: 'Sorry to burden you, but could you bring it to ${entity: 0} again for me?${prompt}'
  14019: Also, I'd like it if you could please fill me in when you're done.${prompt}
  14020: |-
    I see you've returned.
    Mmm...that's good news indeed. Thank you for the kindness you've shown me and my friend.${prompt}
  14021: |-
    What have we here? A cat burrrglar?
    How dare you despoil the innocent people of our fair nation!${prompt}
  14022: |-
    What am I talking about?
    That's the prrresent I sent ${entity: 0}! How could you have it if you didn't steal it!?${prompt}
  14023: |-
    Oh, I see. You're a defender of justice too.
    Good job negotiating with those Goblin scum. I just hope that rrrepeating that story to everyone you've saved hasn't got you hacking up hairballs.${prompt}
  14024: 'But enough tail wagging. I have some prey I need to take care of, so could you rrredeliver that gift to ${entity: 0} and report back to me when you''re done?${prompt}'
  14025: |-
    What timing! I've just rrreturned from my own mission.
    Whew, good thing ${entity: 0} liked it! That little trinket was as high priced as the hair on a cat's back!
    Anyway, thanks for your help. If your fur ever gets rubbed the wrong way, give me a sign and I'll come rrroaring to the rescue!${prompt}
  14026: |-
    A present...from ${entity: 0}? Oh, glorious day!
    This is for all those times I never got a present and kept telling myself next year will be the one.${prompt}
  14027: |-
    I'm at a loss for what to say! I'm just overwhelmed with a waterfall of emotion!
    Thank you so much!${prompt}
  14028: |-
    And please thank ${entity: 0} the next time you see that good samaritan.
    The person who said, “'Tis better to give than receive” probably never had a gift drought as long as mine. I feel fantastic!${prompt}
  14029: 'Oh, is that...a present? From ${entity: 0}, you say?${prompt}'
  14030: |-
    Ugh, it figures. Did it come with a card that says something pathetic like “I've died a thousand deaths drowning in the depths of your eyes”?
    That scoundrel has been stalking me ever since we happened to meet one day on a boat to Buburimu Peninsula.${prompt}
  14031: |-
    I'm actually quite fed up with these ridiculous baubles, but I'm not one for losing face.
    If you should see ${entity: 0} again, please give my regards and say I found the gift rather...quaint.${prompt}
  14032: 'What''s this? A present addressed to me from ${entity: 0}?${prompt}'
  14033: How unexpectedly charming and thoughtful. This has certainly brightened what was about to be a gloomy Starlight Celebration.${prompt}
  14034: |-
    Would you be so kind as to tell ${entity: 0} that I truly appreciate the gift?
    I am also thoroughly impressed with your selfless nature, adventurer.${prompt}
  14035: 'Could it be...? Indeed, it is benevolence manifest, emanating from the humble home of one ${entity: 0}?${prompt}'
  14036: |-
    What a decidedly pleasant surprise. I am simply beside myself with an unbridled, childish glee that has not washed over me in ever so long.
    I swear that I am on the brink of giggling like I used to when I was still knee-high to a Taru.${prompt}
  14037: 'The finite words of us mere mortals may not be sufficient to convey the depths of my gratitude, but I earnestly hope ${entity: 0} would appreciate a succinct “Thank you.”${prompt}'
  14038: 'A present from...${entity: 0}? This isn''t one of those tricky-wicky flimflams, is it?${prompt}'
  14039: |-
    Of course I'll take it! I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, even if it's from my mortaru enemy!
    Maybe ${entity: 0} has turned over a new leaf since we last met...${prompt}
  14040: Well then, I suppose some thanks are in order. But if I find out that this was just some elaborataru scheme to make me lower my guard, I'm going to boppy-wop you both in the noggin!${prompt}
  14041: |-
    Oooh, a gift from ${entity: 0}?
    What jolly-wolly tidings you've brought, adventurer.${prompt}
  14042: |-
    I wonder what's inside... Could it be a scrum-diddly-umptious cake?
    But I've already gotten so roly-poly during the holiday season! Maybe I should just send it back! ${prompt}
  14043: |-
    No, thataru wouldn't be right. Besides, it might not be edible.
    Anyway, please be sure to thank ${entity: 0} for pudding the icing on such a delectable Starcake Chocolation.
    Ugh, I'm just terrible!${prompt}
  14044: 'Why would ${entity: 0} be sending me a gift? It''s not like there''s anything special going on.${prompt}'
  14045: |-
    The Starlight Celebration, you say? So that explains the light shows and festive atmosphere around here lately.
    My head just hasn't been the same since I fell off that chocobo last month.${prompt}
  14046: |-
    I best start looking for something to give in return. In the meantime, please tell ${entity: 0} how happy I am to have received this.
    And maybe next year I'll remember before it's too late. <Sigh>...One can only hope.${prompt}
  14047: "A present for me? \nI'm a lone lioness, and I don't need to share my kills with anyone!${prompt}"
  14048: 'What? ${entity: 0} wanted me to have this? Well, I guess I could take it...${prompt}'
  14049: |-
    Don't get the wrrrong idea! It's not like I enjoy the gift or anything!
    Just run back to ${entity: 0} and drop dead! This conversation never happened!${prompt}

    It's a present from our friend Chamama.
    As for how it's going to help yer trainin', ye've got me...${prompt}

  14068: You've heard of Adoulin, right? Th' marine trading city located way to th' west, across the Sea of Zafmlug?${prompt}
  14069: Well, it turns out there's undeveloped land all around there. We're talking malms and malms of jungle. Lately there's been a huge push to reclaim that land and make it worth livin' on.${prompt}
  14070: Doesn't that jus' beat all? Pristine land still exists, despite all th' progress we've made. Whaddaya think it's like out there?${prompt}

  14074: But ya got that aura of confidence about ya. Maybe yer just what they're lookin' for.${prompt}
  14075: I'll be straight wit' ya. The “test” ain't no sit-down thing with pen and parchment. It's a bit more...hands-on.${prompt}

  14596: “Unity” is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.${prompt}
  14597: Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.${prompt}
  14598: 'Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as “${keyitem-plural: 1[2]}.”${prompt}'
  14599: Chat settings may be changed by selecting “Status” from the main menu, and choosing “Unity Info” under the “Unity” submenu.${prompt}
  14600: You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.${prompt}
  14601: Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.${prompt}
  14602: The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.${prompt}
  14603: Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt}
  14604: Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt}
  14605: “Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt}
  14606: These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as “Unity accolades” to undertake.${prompt}
  14607: Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt}
  14608: Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.${prompt}
  14609: The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.${prompt}
  14610: A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.${prompt}
  14611: Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.${prompt}
  14612: Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.${prompt}
  14613: When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt}
  14614: Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  14615: No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt}
  14616: You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt}
  14617: An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt}
  14618: One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt}
  14619: A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt}
  14620: You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.${prompt}
  14621: Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.${prompt}
  14622: Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.${prompt}
  14623: Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.${prompt}
  14624: The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.${prompt}
  14625: It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.${prompt}
  14626: The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.${prompt}
  14627: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  14628: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt}
  14629: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt}
  14630: 'Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of ${number: 0} accolades per week (Earth time).${prompt}'
  14631: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt}
  14632: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt}
  14633: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt}
  14634: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt}
  14635: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt}
  14636: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt}
  14637: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt}
  14638: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt}
  14639: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt}
  14640: 'Additionally, an individual''s evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity''s ranking is the average of all eligible members'' individual evaluations.${prompt}'
  14641: The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt}
  14642: Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt}
  14643: 'Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt}'
  14644: Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt}
  14645: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt}
  14646: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt}
  14647: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt}
  14648: It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt}

  14987: I see... You must've met with her already.${prompt}

  14990: I know just how skilled you are, and if she selected you for this task, then I suppose you've got what it takes to make this shield.${prompt}
  14991: Now then, let's get down to it. First, you're going to need the recipe, so try not to forget it.${prompt}
  14992: 'First of all, you''re going to need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to get started...${prompt}'
  14993: 'This particular item is used to get the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} up to its maximum value.${prompt}'
  14994: I have some notes here about Craftsmanship that you should hear. Allow me to read them to you.${prompt}
  14995: 'You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt}'
  14996: Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.${prompt}
  14997: In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt}
  14998: You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt}
  14999: That's all it says.${prompt}
  15000: 'Come show me what you''ve got when the Craftsmanship is high enough and I''ll make you the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  15001: 'Your next step will be to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}, which you can get from Puyutete.${prompt}'
  15002: You've made deliveries to people before, right? That's basically what you'll need to do here.${prompt}
  15003: Simply talk to Puyutete if you need more information.${prompt}
  15004: That's it for the ingredients. Once you've upgraded the shield, come show it to me. I'd like to see how it turned out.${prompt}
  15005: What? You forgot the recipe? Okay, here are the ingredients again. Someone of your skill level really should remember these things.${prompt}
  15006: You have a good eye for detail. If anybody can make this shield, I know you can.${prompt}
  15007: 'Hmm... This really is something. I should be able to use this to make the ${item-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt}'
  15008: 'So this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  15009: This act of a craftsman pouring his very spirit into the shield to form a crystal... It could be used for all kinds of other applications, especially jewelry.${prompt}
  15010: 'Oh, my. It seems that creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]} caused a reduction in the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  15011: 'That''s not a problem to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but if you need to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you''d have to increase the Craftsmanship again of course.${prompt}'
  15012: Although, I really doubt you'd ever lose such a valuable item and need to make another one.${prompt}
  15013: 'Impossible. You''re telling me you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  15014: 'I guess these things happen. Okay, let me see the shield. I''ll make you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  15015: You're a top quality craftsman. You really should take better care of your ingredients.${prompt}
  15016: I see you made the upgrade. Now, let me see what you've got there.${prompt}
  15017: Hmm... The design has changed, and I can feel its power somewhat. Of course, it's nowhere near complete yet.${prompt}
  15018: It's said that you can only bring out the shield's true potential by crafting with it multiple times.${prompt}
  15019: Oh, that's right. I'm supposed to place some kind of mark on the shield once it's done. Give me just a moment.${prompt}
  15020: That should do it.${prompt}
  15021: Just show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.${prompt}
  15022: Oh, keep in mind that I'm constantly making deliveries to Puyutete. I hope you'll continue helping me out to educate the newer members of the guild.${prompt}
  15023: Welcome. I suppose you're here to upgrade your shield.${prompt}
  15024: Yes, she told me all about it. Here, let me get you the necessary recipe.${prompt}
  15025: That's it.${prompt}
  15026: 'Now, let''s go over how to obtain the ingredients. First up is the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  15027: Last time, you equipped the aspis while crafting in order to boost its Craftsmanship rating.${prompt}
  15028: 'This time, you''ll craft the items while equipping the ${item-singular: 0[2]} in order to increase its Craftsmanship.${prompt}'
  15029: 'Come bring it to me once it reaches 100% and I''ll make the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  15030: 'Next up is the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and ${item-singular: 3[2]}. I have given both of them to Puyutete, so you''ll need to speak with her to get them.${prompt}'
  15031: 'The last ingredient is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. With the help of the A.M.A.N., I have prepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt}'
  15032: 'Check the Records of Eminence menu for more details on the objectives. You''ll receive the ${item-singular: 4[2]} once you''ve completed all of them.${prompt}'
  15033: That's it for the explanation about the ingredients. I look forward to seeing what this shield can become. Good luck to you.${prompt}
  15034: Ahh, it looks like you've sufficiently raised the shield's Craftsmanship.${prompt}
  15035: 'Now, wait just a moment while I prepare the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  15036: There we go. It really does have a nice shine to it, don't you think?${prompt}
  15037: 'Oh, I thought this might happen. It seems creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]} causes the shield''s Craftsmanship to drop.${prompt}'
  15038: If you lose this thing, you'll need to boost the shield's Craftsmanship all over again. Make sure you keep it in a safe place until you're ready to craft with it.${prompt}
  15039: This is quite impressive. Even though it's not a piece of jewelry, it sure shines like one.${prompt}
  15040: Yes, I can feel the immense power coming from this shield. I can't wait to see just how powerful it can become.${prompt}
  15041: Here, let me mark the shield for when you show it to her.${prompt}
  15042: That ought to do it. Show the shield to Mewk Chorosap when you get a chance.${prompt}
  15043: Well, these things happen from time to time. I'll arrange for you to attempt the final objective one more time.${prompt}
  15044: How are you doing? I suppose you're here to upgrade your shield? In that case, let me get you that recipe...${prompt}
  15045: Huh? You already know the recipe? You just need to know about some of the ingredients?${prompt}
  15046: 'Okay, for the remaining two ingredients, we have ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}.${prompt}'
  15047: If you agree to help the guild deliver some orders, I'll be happy to give them to you.${prompt}
  15048: Although, there's more to it than just making the delivery. You have to craft the items near the customer. They have a real eye for quality and want to see the work done in person.${prompt}
  15049: There are some exceptions, such as items used for repairs, but most of them will need to be crafted in the presence of the customer.${prompt}
  15050: You'll need to gather the materials needed to craft the items by yourself. You're free to use whatever method you like.${prompt}
  15051: Oh yes. Did you know that we recently reached an agreement with the other guilds to sell some of their products?${prompt}
  15052: They're not always cheap, but you can purchase them by speaking to each guild's crafting set vendor.${prompt}
  15053: Of course, there's no guarantee that they'll sell you what you're looking for, so be sure to keep that in mind.${prompt}
  15054: 'Once you''ve finished all of the deliveries, I''ll give you the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}.${prompt}'
  15055: 'Okay, this is the ${choice: 0}[first/next/final] request.${prompt}'
  15056: 'Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to the merchant Honoi-Gomoi in ${unknown: 0x01053782EE8180}.${prompt}'
  15057: 'Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to the merchant Honoi-Gomoi in ${unknown: 0x01053782EE8180}.${prompt}'
  15058: 'Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Naji the Mythril Musketeer in ${unknown: 0x01053782ED8180}.${prompt}'
  15059: 'Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Matoaka at the Gems by Kshama shop in ${unknown: 0x01053782F58180}.${prompt}'
  15060: You don't need to make this particular item near the customer.${prompt}
  15061: Please report back to me once you've completed the request.${prompt}
  15062: Let's see... The current task assigned to you is...${prompt}
  15063: So, how is the delivery going?${prompt}
  15064: |-
    Everything okay?
    ${selection-lines}
    Everything's great!
    It could be better...${prompt}
  15065: That's a relief. Please keep up the good work.${prompt}
  15066: What's that? You want to abandon this task?${prompt}
  15067: |-
    Will you see this through?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'll do my best.
    I've had enough.${prompt}
  15068: That's unfortunate. Although, it's for the best if you can't give it your all. I guess I'll have to find another craftsman to help me with this customer.${prompt}
  15069: Please try to get some rest. There'll be more work for you when you come back.${prompt}
  15070: Ahh, it's good to see you're feeling better. I've already got another job lined up for you.${prompt}
  15071: Ahh, it seems you have made the delivery to the customer.${prompt}
  15072: That is the last of the deliveries. I'm really grateful for your help.${prompt}
  15073: 'Okay, here are the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${item-singular: 1[2]} I promised you.${prompt}'
  15074: If, and I do mean if, you happen to lose one of them, you can always visit Puyutete and exchange guild points for another one.${prompt}
  15075: Once this shield is finished, are you planning on making crystals instead? Haha... I'm just joking.${prompt}
  15076: So this is what the shield looks like this time around, hm?${prompt}
  15077: It's so bright... Your talent really is indisputable. I'm thinking our guild should start carrying your shields. They'd be one of our biggest sellers.${prompt}
  15078: Our mutual friend has mentioned that the next upgrade should unlock the shield's true power. I'm excited to see just how powerful it can become.${prompt}
  15079: Oh yes, that reminds me... I think you are skilled enough to use this new crafting technique I've developed. Please give it a try when you get a chance.${prompt}
  15080: Welcome. It looks like we've reached the final step in this process. It's going to take every last bit of your knowledge.${prompt}
  15081: You've heard which materials you need, right? If so, I'll explain how to get them.${prompt}
  15082: 'First, the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and the ${item-singular: 3[2]}...${prompt}'
  15083: You can trade crafter points for them. Go visit Puyutete when you have enough points.${prompt}
  15084: 'Next, the procedure for the ${item-singular: 1[2]} is the same as it''s always been. Just boost your shield''s Craftsmanship to 100% and then come show it to me.${prompt}'
  15085: That concludes the explanation. Try building up the Craftsmanship first. Good luck to you.${prompt}
  15086: You've probably already heard, but Mewk Chorosap wants this. Please deliver it to her for me.${prompt}
  15087: Oh, hello. What can I do for you?${prompt}
  15088: Ah, so that's why you're here. You're looking for the item that Tarutaru from Adoulin requested.${prompt}
  15089: Unfortunately, I already sent it to Jeuno as per her request.${prompt}
  15090: It should've arrived by now. You should check with Mewk Chorosap in Port Jeuno.${prompt}
  15091: The strangest thing happened. That emblem you were looking for was just sitting on the counter here in the guild.${prompt}
  15092: It doesn't seem as if it was returned. Oh, that's right. You need it for something, don't you. Here, consider it yours.${prompt}
  15093: Oh! That must be it...${prompt}
  15094: That's the finished shield. It truly is a work of art. I can feel it giving off a powerful aura.${prompt}
  15095: Also, just you equipping this shield will be an excellent way to spread the word about our guild. This emblem will tell them all they need to know!${prompt}
  15096: You have proven yourself to be quite talented. I think it's time I taught you this new technique.${prompt}
  15097: Let us continue to create works of art that people will be proud to wear on their bodies.${prompt}
  15098: '0: ${number: 0} 1: ${number: 1} 2: ${number: 2} 3: ${number: 3}${prompt}'
  15099: 'It''s doubly delightful to see you here for the ${number: 2}th anniversary, kupo!${prompt}'

  15113: I guess I've got to gift you another one, kupo. Please try to be more careful this time.${prompt}
  15114: '${choice: 1}[Hi there!/Hello, friend!] I see you got letter I give to moogle.${prompt}'
  15115: Happy 20th Vana'versary!${prompt}
  15116: I hope you ready to play Mandragora Mania Madness!${prompt}
  15117: Since this new game, would you like to check rules in manual?${prompt}
  15118: |-
    Read the manual?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure.
    No thanks.${prompt}
  15119: Mandragora Mania Madness is a game in which players battle by placing different colored game pieces on a 4x4 playing area.${prompt}
  15120: You use the white pieces (mandragoras), while your opponent uses the black pieces (corrigans).${prompt}
  15121: The player to go first is determined randomly when the game begins. You will be able to adjust these settings yourself from the second game onward.${prompt}
  15122: The first player to place four pieces so they align in a row will be declared the winner.${prompt}
  15123: However, you will automatically be disqualified if you ever place three of your pieces in a row, so be mindful of your moves at all times.${prompt}
  15124: Note that if you place your game pieces so that you have both three and four pieces in a row, the row with four pieces will take precedence and you will win the game.${prompt}
  15125: If you place a game piece on either side of your opponent's piece, you will convert it into one of your pieces.${prompt}
  15126: You can play anywhere from three to five games, and the first player to win three games is the winner.${prompt}
  15127: Now, for an explanation on points.${prompt}
  15128: |-
    You receive points after the completion of each game.
    The points are tallied using units known as mandy.${prompt}
  15129: |-
    If you win the game, you will receive a number of points equal to the number of game pieces you have on the board.
    In the example shown, you will earn 8 mandy.${prompt}
  15130: Even if you lose the game, you will receive a number of points equal to half the number of your game pieces on the board (rounded off to avoid fractions).${prompt}
  15131: The first player to win three games gets to keep all of the points they have earned, although you won't get any points if you quit partway.${prompt}
  15132: Occasionally, you might get to play a bonus game, where your pieces are pink (adenium) or feature a watermelon pattern (citrullus).${prompt}
  15133: 'They are worth ${number: 0}x and ${number: 1}x the points, respectively, giving you the chance to quickly score a large number of points.${prompt}'
  15134: The key to victory is to not just try and place four pieces in a row, but to position your pieces in a way that forces your opponent to place three pieces in a row.${prompt}
  15135: See? Is very easy! Ready to give try?${prompt}
  15136: You get mandy if you win or lose, but not if you quit partway!${prompt}
  15137: Can trade mandy for many goodies.${prompt}
  15138: Then I just give one piece of advice.${prompt}
  15139: You get mandy if you win or lose, but not if you quit partway!${prompt}
  15140: You can look at manual later if you need reminder on how to play.${prompt}

  15183: I've convinced all the movers and shakers in Bastok to assist me in holding the most amazing fashion show the city--no, all of Vana'diel!--has ever seen!${prompt}
  15184: I've convinced all the movers and shakers in Bastok to assist me in holding the most amazing fashion show the city--no, all of Vana'diel!--has ever seen!${prompt}

  15187: You see, I've convinced all the movers and shakers in Bastok to assist me in holding the most amazing fashion show the city--no, all of Vana'diel!--has ever seen!${prompt}
  15188: The city is hoping that this initiative will help stimulate the local economy, bringing in people from far and wide to spend, spend, spend!${prompt}
  15189: You see, fashion does not discriminate between creed or place of origin--and I firmly believe that there is an outfit for everyone.${prompt}
  15190: But I'm having trouble finding people to lend themselves to the cause.${prompt}
  15191: If I didn't know better, I'd think people were mistaking my honest critiques for cruel barbs hurled by an uncaring judge.${prompt}
  15192: Yet fashion can at times be uncompromising, and that's where you come in.${prompt}
  15193: Assist me, and I promise that I'll come up with the perfect disguise for your friend Raebrimm.${prompt}

    I'm not model material...${prompt}

  15197: For this isn't an ordinary fashion show--it's a costume show!${prompt}
  15198: “The First Annual Brygid Cosplay Fiesta”!!!${prompt}
  15199: Let me know if you want to hear more.${prompt}
  15200: Perfect! Then let's get right down to business. The official name of this show is...${prompt}
  15201: “The First Annual Brygid Cosplay Fiesta”!!!${prompt}
  15202: Let me know if you want to hear more.${prompt}
  15203: 'But here''s what I want you to do in the short term: decide on someone after whom you want to model your costume.${prompt}'
  15204: This is going to be the best fashion show ever!${prompt}
  15205: This costume show is going to be the talk of the town for months, and here's how it's going to work.${prompt}
  15206: If you listen to my explanation well and decide on someone spectacular to dress as, there's no way anything'll go wrong!${prompt}
  15207: |-
    Any questions?
    ${selection-lines}
    What's this costume show about?
    Who can I dress as?
    I've decided!
    Nothing for now.${prompt}
  15208: In this costume show, you select a person whose appearance you want to mimic and dress up just like them.${prompt}
  15209: Since the show takes place in Bastok, it only makes sense for you to pick one of the city's many storied personages.${prompt}
  15210: Once you've picked a mark...I mean, a person...you need to look very carefully at what they're wearing and try to come up with an identical outfit.${prompt}
  15211: Specifically, take a look at their headgear, chestgear, handgear, leggear, and footwear. You don't have to worry about their weapons or accessories.${prompt}
  15212: Once you've got your garb nice and squared away, put it on and head to the Steaming Sheep restaurant.${prompt}
  15213: That's where my special runway awaits, needing only for you to stand atop it and strike a dashing pose.${prompt}
  15214: Of course, I know this is a decent amount of work, and although fashion is a reward unto itself, I've still prepared monetary compensation for all participants. The more you impress the crowd, the better the reward.${prompt}
  15215: So try to come up with the perfect outfit and whip the audience into a frenzy!${prompt}
  15216: The first thing you have to know is that the wonderful Brygid believes that good sense transcends all races and genders, so what's important is the costume itself; if a Tarutaru male wants to mimic a Mithra, that's A-OK in my book.${prompt}
  15217: However, this particular show really focuses on particular famous people from here in the city, so I want you to mimic certain individuals. No choosing some random hick from over in Rabao.${prompt}
  15218: It's only common sense. Where's the fun in dressing up as someone that nobody's ever heard of?${prompt}
  15219: '...And it pains me to say this, but some of the best choices have already been taken by other participants.${prompt}'
  15220: So let's go down the list of potential selections. First up is Azima, the esteemed master of alchemy.${prompt}
