    Rien.${prompt}
  8: Hmm… pas beaucoup de travail pour ceux qui sont encore novices, mais…${prompt}
  9: Que dirais-tu d’éliminer des éclaireurs orques ? Seuls les plus peureux des nouveaux venus fuiraient devant cela, et nous n’avons pas de travail pour les lâches ici.${prompt}

  12: Voici ta mission. Des éclaireurs orques rôdent à l’extérieur ; tue-en un et rapporte-moi sa hache comme preuve.${prompt}
  13: 'Tu devras me rapporter ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Aucun autre type ne fera l’affaire. Compris ?${prompt}'

  16: Rapporte-moi une de ces haches, et ta mission sera un succès. Pas question de fuir maintenant ; nous avons un fier pays à défendre !${prompt}
  17: Oh, te voilà de retour. Eh bien, si tu es si heureux d’avoir vaincu un ou deux Orcs, tu as encore un long chemin à parcourir !${prompt}
  18: 'Voilà une autre ${item-singular: 0[2]} pour l’armurerie, alors. Mission terminée ! Pas mal pour une nouvelle recrue.${prompt}'
  19: Quoi ? Je ne veux pas de ça !${prompt}
  20: Es-tu vraiment une nouvelle recrue !?${prompt}
  21: Écoute, avant de me rapporter quelque chose, tu dois d’abord accepter la mission ! C’est comme ça que ça fonctionne ici !${prompt}
  22: Persistant, n’est-ce pas ? Avoir un Orc à ton actif ne fait pas de toi un héros ! Ah, j’ai exactement le travail pour toi…${prompt}
  23: Patrouille de chauves-souris ! Qu’en dis-tu ? Ça ne devrait pas être un problème pour un aventurier comme toi, non ?${prompt}
  24: Voici ta mission, alors. Élimine les chauves-souris qui se cachent dans la Tombe du Roi Ranperre et rapporte-moi un croc comme preuve.${prompt}
  25: 'Rapporte-moi ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} et ta mission sera un succès.${prompt}'
  26: Au fond de la tombe, tu trouveras des Gobelins. Fais attention ; je ne veux pas te perdre si tôt.${prompt}
  27: Ah, te voilà de retour ! J’avais peur que les Gobelins t’aient eu.${prompt}
  28: 'Voilà un ${item-singular: 3[2]} pour le poste de garde, alors. Mission terminée. Pas mal pour une nouvelle recrue.${prompt}'
  29: Ah, la recrue est de retour ? Je suis désolé, mais je n’ai pas de temps pour toi aujourd’hui.${prompt}
  30: Eh bien, peut-être que tu peux être utile. Beaucoup de nos enfants ont mystérieusement disparu, et je n’ai aucun doute que les Orcs de Ghelsba en sont responsables.${prompt}
  31: Les Chevaliers Royaux devraient déjà être sur le coup, mais les deux princes sont en désaccord total.${prompt}
  32: Le Prince Trion, l’aîné, dit que nous devrions lancer une attaque totale, et ce, au plus vite.${prompt}
  33: Tandis que son jeune frère, le Prince Pieuje, dit que la sécurité des enfants passe avant tout, et qu’il n’autorisera pas une attaque.${prompt}
  34: Ils se disputent sur ce sujet depuis des jours. Les chevaliers ont les mains liées, et franchement, personne ne sait quoi faire.${prompt}
  35: Si tu veux vraiment te faire un nom, va à Ghelsba et sauve ces enfants kidnappés !${prompt}
  36: Qu’en dis-tu ? Vas-tu y aller ?${prompt}
  37: Voici ta mission, alors. Sauve les deux enfants kidnappés par les Orcs de l’Avant-poste de Ghelsba.${prompt}
  38: L’Avant-poste de Ghelsba est au nord-ouest de Ronfaure Ouest. Prends le chemin avant la Porte Ouest, puis tourne à droite lorsque le chemin se sépare dans la forêt. Tu trouveras l’entrée en haut des collines.${prompt}
  39: Si tu as du mal à trouver le chemin, suis simplement l’un des soldats en patrouille.${prompt}
  40: Les Orcs ont tendance à garder leurs otages dans des tentes ou de petites cabanes. Une fois à l’intérieur du camp, vérifie d’abord ces endroits.${prompt}
  41: Ah, te voilà de retour ! Tu es parti si longtemps, j’ai craint qu’une machine de guerre ne t’ait eu !${prompt}
  42: Quoi qu’il en soit, mission terminée ! Et pour récompenser ton exploit…${prompt}
  43: Par la présente, je te reconnais, ${name-player}, comme un aventurier certifié de San d’Oria ! Tu es également au rang deux pour les missions, désormais.${prompt}
  44: Mais ne t’emballe pas trop. Ton titre est valable uniquement ici à San d’Oria, compris ?${prompt}
  45: 'Pour devenir un véritable aventurier et porter ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, tu dois aussi être reconnu par Bastok et Windurst.${prompt}'
  46: 'C’est un traité entre les trois nations, et sa parole fait loi. Je sais que c’est difficile, mais ce sont les règles.${prompt}'
  47: Pour l’instant, fais tes premières armes dans les zones près d’ici. Tôt ou tard, tu trouveras ton chemin vers d’autres terres.${prompt}
  48: Tu atteins le rang 2 !${prompt}
  49: Il n’y a pas beaucoup de travail en ce moment. Je suppose que tu pourrais aller participer aux exercices de sauvetage des Chevaliers du Temple sur le Plateau de La Theine.${prompt}
  50: Entre dans la forêt au-delà de la Porte Ouest et dirige-toi vers le sud-ouest. Tu arriveras bientôt sur le Plateau de La Theine.${prompt}
  51: Une fois sur le plateau, continue jusqu’à ce que tu voies les chevaliers. Le terrain d’entraînement n’est pas loin de là.${prompt}
  52: Ce n’est qu’un exercice, donc ça devrait être facile comparé à ce que tu fais d’habitude. Suis simplement les ordres et tout ira bien.${prompt}
  53: Te voilà de retour ! J’ai entendu dire que l’exercice s’est transformé en quelque chose de bien plus périlleux. Mais un vrai combat est le meilleur entraînement pour les recrues, à mon avis.${prompt}
  54: Quoi qu’il en soit, tu as bien travaillé. Je ferai appel à toi quand il y aura du travail à faire, maintenant.${prompt}
  55: 'Tiens, prends ce ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Vas-y, tu l’as mérité.${prompt}'
  56: Cette fois, c’est une mission de messager. L’un de nos chevaliers est en repérage dans un endroit appelé Davoi, à la lisière sud de la Forêt de Jugner.${prompt}
  57: La forteresse des Orcs se trouve à Davoi, donc il est crucial que nous les empêchions de se rassembler, sinon ils pourraient lancer une attaque.${prompt}
  58: Bien sûr, les Orcs nous surveillent aussi. Il y a juste quelques jours, une escouade de nos Chevaliers Royaux est tombée sous leurs haches.${prompt}
  59: Nous avons envoyé des éclaireurs pour trouver une faiblesse dans leurs défenses. Tu dois trouver l’éclaireur là-bas maintenant, et ramener le dernier rapport de reconnaissance.${prompt}
  60: L’éclaireur s’appelle Zantaviat. Il est quelque part à Davoi, mais je ne peux pas dire où exactement.${prompt}
  61: Reviens après avoir obtenu le rapport. Ces terres ne sont pas un endroit où flâner.${prompt}
  62: Tu es de retour ! Et tu as apporté le rapport de reconnaissance. Bon travail, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  63: Des nouvelles inquiétantes, ceci. Il est dit que les Orcs se rassemblent au fond du campement. Le moment d’agir approche !${prompt}
  64: Mais ce n’est pas ton souci. Tu as bien travaillé aujourd’hui. Mission terminée !${prompt}
  65: Oh, c’est toi, ${name-player}. Et au bon moment, en plus. Monarlais Halver cherche un aventurier comme toi.${prompt}
  66: Entre dans le Château d’Oraguille. Monarlais Halver est là ; il t’expliquera en personne.${prompt}
  67: Quoi ? Tu n’as pas encore été certifié à Bastok et Windurst ? Tu peux traîner, mais les autres ne le font pas ! Dépêche-toi !${prompt}
  68: Ah, te revoilà. Je vois que tu as été certifié à Bastok et Windurst. Bon travail. Tu feras un excellent aventurier.${prompt}
  69: Qu’est-ce que c’est, un rapport pour notre royaume ? Je vois. Apporte-le au monarlais quand tu y vas.${prompt}
  70: 'Tu devrais recevoir ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} de Monarlais Halver. Maintenant, va au Château d’Oraguille et fais-leur savoir que tu es de retour !${prompt}'
  71: Dépêche-toi d’aller au Château d’Oraguille et donne ce rapport à Monarlais Halver !${prompt}
  72: Tu atteins le rang 3 !${prompt}
  73: Ah ! Tu arrives au bon moment. Zantaviat, l’un de nos éclaireurs à Davoi, a besoin d’un aventurier.${prompt}
  74: Il veut quelqu’un pour infiltrer Davoi et explorer derrière les lignes ennemies. Connais-tu quelqu’un qui correspond à cette description ?${prompt}
  75: 'Maintenant que tu as ton ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, c’est une occasion de prouver que tu en vaux la peine !${prompt}'
  76: La situation à Davoi empire de jour en jour. Ce ne sera pas facile, mais je ne peux pas penser à un meilleur aventurier pour ce travail !${prompt}
  77: Te voilà de retour ! Zantaviat m’a tout raconté. Félicitations pour un travail bien fait !${prompt}
  78: Mais nous ne pouvons pas baisser notre garde pour autant. Ces Orcs ne vont pas rester là sans rien faire. Nous devons rester vigilants en permanence et agir avant eux !${prompt}
  79: 'Voici ta récompense : ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Tu deviens tout à fait un aventurier, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}'
  80: Bienvenue de retour ! J’ai une mission importante pour toi cette fois. Récemment, les terres s’érodent à cause de la formation de cristaux… et ça empire.${prompt}
  81: Il y a une petite source à la lisière est de la Forêt de Jugner, appelée Source d’Eau Cristalline. Nous devons savoir quel effet la formation de cristaux a sur la faune là-bas.${prompt}
  82: 'Je veux que tu me ramènes un poisson de la source. Et pas n’importe quel poisson ! Tu dois ramener ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  83: Ah, ça me rappelle – as-tu du matériel de pêche ? Tu en auras besoin pour cette mission.${prompt}
  84: Il y a des gens autour qui savent une ou deux choses sur la pêche, si tu as besoin d’aide pour trouver et choisir ton équipement.${prompt}
  85: Ah, le grand pêcheur est de retour ! J’étais inquiet, pour être honnête. Tout ce qu’on entend ces jours-ci, c’est le rassemblement des bêtes, l’érosion des Lignes de Cristal, et maintenant…${prompt}
  86: '…des rumeurs selon lesquelles le Seigneur des Ombres lui-même serait de retour !${prompt}'
  87: Nous allons examiner le poisson que tu as apporté. Selon les résultats, nous devrons peut-être agir ! Je te ferai savoir si nous avons besoin de ton aide.${prompt}
  88: Ah, c’est toi, ${name-player}. Tu arrives à point nommé. J’ai des nouvelles pour toi.${prompt}
  89: Par ordre du Royaume de San d’Oria, tu dois te rendre à Jeuno en tant qu’attaché d’ambassade.${prompt}
  90: Va au Château d’Oraguille. Monarlais Halver te dira tout ce que tu dois savoir.${prompt}

  97: ${prompt}
  98: ${prompt}
  99: Te voilà ! Je te cherchais. Monarlais Halver demande ta présence au château immédiatement.${prompt}
  100: On dirait une mission assez importante. Je n’ai pas besoin de te rappeler que tu dois t’équiper correctement avant de te lancer dans ce voyage.${prompt}
  101: Je ne sais pas de quoi il s’agit, mais tu ferais mieux de te dépêcher. On ne fait pas attendre le monarlais !${prompt}
  102: Tiens, mais c’est ${name-player} ! Ce n’est pas le moment de traîner, mon ami ! Le Prince Trion te cherche.${prompt}
  103: Pour la prochaine mission, il t’a personnellement requis. Tu devrais être honoré !${prompt}
  104: Quant aux détails de la mission, je n’ai aucune idée de ce qu’il veut, mais il était pressé. Tu ferais mieux de te rendre au Château d’Oraguille !${prompt}
  105: C’est une grande chose que tu as accomplie, ${name-player} ! Je savais au fond de mon cœur que tu étais la personne idéale pour cette tâche.${prompt}
  106: Tu ferais mieux de te rendre au château rapidement. Je parie qu’ils attendent tous pour t’accueillir à ton retour.${prompt}
  107: Tu as sauvé notre fier Royaume de San d’Oria. Non, tu es le sauveur de tout Vana’diel ! Il n’y a pas une âme qui ne te doive une immense gratitude, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  108: |-
    Ah, mais c’est ${name-player} !
    Tu ferais mieux de te dépêcher d’aller au Château d’Oraguille. On dirait que quelque chose de terrible se prépare là-bas.${prompt}
  109: |-
    Eh bien, mais c’est ${name-player} !
    Ton timing est parfait. Le château vient juste d’envoyer une demande pour un aventurier.${prompt}
  110: On dirait que la prochaine mission a un lien avec la défunte reine. Tu devrais te sentir honoré. Ce n’est pas tous les jours qu’un aventurier a l’occasion de travailler directement avec la famille royale.${prompt}
  111: |-
    Parlé comme un vrai San d’Orien !
    Maintenant, dépêche-toi d’aller au Château d’Oraguille et obtiens les détails de la mission auprès de Monarlais Halver.${prompt}
  112: Qu’est-ce qui ne va pas ? Traiter avec la royauté n’est pas ton fort ? Eh bien, réfléchis-y et reviens quand tu auras repris tes esprits.${prompt}
  113: Le Prince Trion demande l’aide d’un aventurier. Qu’en dis-tu ?${prompt}
  114: Ça semble assez urgent, alors tu devrais te dépêcher d’aller au château. Le prince t’attend dans ses appartements.${prompt}
  115: J’attendais plus de toi, ${name-player}. Si tu changes d’avis, reviens ici. Je t’attendrai.${prompt}
  116: J’ai reçu les détails de ta mission de la part du Prince Trion. Je vais livrer ce livre aux érudits pour qu’ils le déchiffrent.${prompt}
  117: 'Le déchiffrement du ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} prendra un temps considérable. Reviens plus tard pour un rapport.${prompt}'
  118: 'Tu as remis le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} au garde.${prompt}'
  119: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}. Nous t’attendions.
    Le Prince Trion t’appelle. Je me demande si cela signifie que le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} a été complètement déchiffré.${prompt}
  120: Bien joué, ${name-player} ! Je savais que tu ne décevrais pas le Royaume.${prompt}
  121: J’ai l’honneur d’augmenter ton rang à 7 !${prompt}
  122: Le papsque a du travail pour toi, ${name-player}. Es-tu prêt à relever cette tâche ?${prompt}
  123: Excellent. Rends-toi dans les appartements du papsque au troisième étage de la cathédrale.${prompt}
  124: Le papsque peut souvent sembler être un homme difficile, mais il est en réalité très bienveillant et compatissant. Si tu changes d’avis, je serai ici à t’attendre.${prompt}
  125: La belle Claidie I d’Oraguille t’a invité au château. Elle souhaite que tu voies les fleurs qui ont éclos à partir des graines que tu as rapportées d’Altepa.${prompt}
  126: C’est un honneur d’être invité dans le jardin du château. Un jour, tu auras peut-être même l’occasion d’assister à l’une de leurs réceptions royales dans le jardin.${prompt}
  127: Nous ne pouvons pas faire attendre la princesse. Maintenant, direction le château !${prompt}
  128: Un groupe de Chevaliers Royaux stationnés à l’Avant-poste de Ghelsba a rapporté une activité étrange des Orcs au plus profond de la Grotte de Yughott.${prompt}
  129: D’après tes rapports, nous savons déjà que les hommes-bêtes ont construit un portail géant, mais leurs motifs restent flous.${prompt}
  130: Ça me fait frissonner de penser à ce que ces Orcs préparent avec ce portail…${prompt}
  131: ${name-player}, ta prochaine mission est de te rendre à Ghelsba et de poursuivre ton enquête sur les activités des Orcs.${prompt}
  132: Sois sur tes gardes lorsque tu t’aventures profondément dans la Grotte de Yughott. Perdre un aventurier tel que toi serait un coup dur pour tout San d’Oria.${prompt}
  133: Je vois que tu as besoin de plus de temps pour te préparer. Quand tu seras prêt, je t’attendrai.${prompt}
  134: C’est difficile à croire que les Orcs aient mis la main sur un équipement aussi dangereux. Il faudra envoyer plus de patrouilles pour empêcher tout nouveau développement dans leurs plans maléfiques.${prompt}
  135: 'Et ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}… Nous devrons l’analyser et commencer à le reproduire pour nos forces. Nous ne pouvons pas laisser les Orcs s’emparer du Trésor du Roi Dragon avant San d’Oria.${prompt}'
  136: Eh bien, félicitations pour avoir terminé ta mission. Hmmm ? Est-ce que je connais un aventurier nommé Eideialc ? Jamais entendu parler de lui.${prompt}
  137: Mais tu n’as pas à t’inquiéter pour un voyageur insignifiant. Tu es dans une tout autre catégorie. Tu es maintenant de rang 8 !${prompt}
  138: La cérémonie de passage à l’âge adulte de la Princesse Claidie approche. Cette cérémonie est une facette importante de la tradition d’Oraguille.${prompt}
  139: Monarlais Halver a lancé un appel aux aventuriers de haut rang pour leur assistance au Château d’Oraguille.${prompt}
  140: Ah, la jeune princesse est enfin devenue une femme… Oh, je suis désolé. Tu peux obtenir les détails de ta prochaine mission auprès de Seigneur Halver.${prompt}
  141: Quoi ? Tu ne souhaites pas rendre la gentillesse que la princesse t’a témoignée ces derniers mois ? Comme tu veux… mais si tu changes d’avis, tu sais où me trouver.${prompt}
  142: Je suis occupé avec les préparatifs de la cérémonie de passage à l’âge adulte de la Princesse Claidie. On ne sait pas quel genre de vermine pourrait rôder dans les rues et chercher des ennuis.${prompt}
  143: La cérémonie de passage à l’âge adulte de la Princesse Claidie est sur le point de commencer à la cathédrale. Je dois rester à mon poste, mais pourquoi n’y assisterais-tu pas ?${prompt}
  144: Le roi a requis ton audience. Il t’a choisi parmi la foule d’aventuriers de San d’Oria. Tu devrais te sentir honoré !${prompt}
  145: Tu as mûri, passant d’un aventurier novice à une grande ressource pour notre royaume. Ne nous déçois pas.${prompt}
  146: Ce n’est pas le moment de faire preuve de modestie. Le destin de San d’Oria est en jeu !${prompt}
  147: Les autorités disent qu’un nuage sombre de désespoir plane sur le Royaume. Elles demandent l’aide des meilleurs aventuriers uniquement.${prompt}
  148: Je ne peux penser à personne de plus qualifié que toi. Accepteras-tu cette mission ?${prompt}
  149: |-
    Alors rends-toi à la Salle d’Audience dans le Château d’Oraguille.
    On dit que Son Altesse ne se sent pas très bien. Il se peut qu’il ne soit pas présent pour ton briefing.${prompt}
  150: ${choice-player-gender}[Seigneur/Madame] ${name-player} ! Le Royaume compte sur toi. Qui d’autre, je te le demande, est digne de cette tâche ?${prompt}
  151: Ah, une période de grands changements est sur nous. Dans quelques jours, les Rites de Succession auront lieu à la cathédrale dans le nord de San d’Oria. C’est à ce moment-là que le nouvel héritier du trône sera décidé.${prompt}
  152: En raison des circonstances imprévisibles qui ont eu lieu lors de la cérémonie de passage à l’âge adulte de la princesse, cette fois, seules les personnes autorisées seront autorisées à s’approcher des cérémonies. Cependant, la famille royale a requis tes services en tant que garde.${prompt}
  153: Même nous, les Chevaliers Royaux, n’avons pas été autorisés à y assister… Tu dois être tenu en haute estime par Son Altesse. Je t’envie, ${choice-player-gender}[Seigneur/Madame].${prompt}
  154: Lorsque tu auras terminé tes préparatifs, rends-toi directement à la cathédrale pour faire ton rapport.${prompt}
  155: Hors sujet, lequel des deux princes penses-tu qui devrait être le prochain héritier du trône ?${prompt}
  156: |-
    C’est une décision difficile, mais…
    ${selection-lines}
    Trion est plus adapté.
    Pieuje est plus adapté.${prompt}
  157: |-
    Hm…
    Étant l’aîné, il est le véritable héritier, et beaucoup de gens pensent qu’il est le plus apte à gouverner le Royaume. Cependant, les manières prudentes du Prince Pieuje pourraient être ce qui manque à ce pays.${prompt}
  158: Beaucoup pensent comme toi, ${choice-player-gender}[Seigneur/Madame] ${name-player}. Cependant, ce dont ce pays a peut-être besoin, c’est de quelqu’un qui ne recule pas face à une menace – quelqu’un qui défendra la fierté du Royaume.${prompt}
  159: Mais notre opinion n’a pas d’importance. Lightbringer décidera qui est le plus apte à diriger notre belle nation. Et ne dis pas un mot de notre échange d’aujourd’hui, car le monarlais nous fera couper la tête s’il l’apprend.${prompt}
  160: Je réalise que tu dois avoir beaucoup de préparatifs avant de te lancer dans une mission aussi importante. Prends ton temps et reviens ici quand tu seras prêt.${prompt}
  161: 'DEBUG: U_MS_START= "${number: 0}"${prompt}'

  6771: I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!${prompt}
  6772: I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!${prompt}
  6773: |-
    First, the basics, kupo!
    Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to “Mog House” when you're in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt}
  6774: Press it and the “Mog House” menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!${prompt}
  6775: There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...${prompt}
  6776: So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!${prompt}
  6777: Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!${prompt}
  6778: |-
    What do you want to know about?
    ${selection-lines}
    The Mog Safe.
    Storage.
    The Delivery Box.
    Changing jobs.
    Gardening.
    Changing the layout.
    Mog House invitations.
    I got it, thanks, kupo!${prompt}
  6779: The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!${prompt}
  6780: You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!${prompt}
  6781: The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!${prompt}
  6782: You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!${prompt}
  6783: If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!${prompt}
  6784: You can send items and gil to your friends with the “Send” command, kupo!${prompt}
  6785: (Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the "Exclusive" attribute, kupo...!)${prompt}
  6786: Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!${prompt}
  6787: I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!${prompt}
  6788: And...the rest is a secret, kupo!${prompt}
  6789: All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!${prompt}
  6790: As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!${prompt}
  6791: This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...${prompt}
  6792: It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!${prompt}
  6793: If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!${prompt}
  6794: Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the “Layout” command, kupo!${prompt}
  6795: |-
    It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo!
    Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!${prompt}
  6796: You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!${prompt}
  6797: You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!${prompt}
  6798: Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?${prompt}
  6799: |-
    Are you sure?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm sure!
    Maybe I'm not so sure...${prompt}
  6800: And finally, a little bit of advice!${prompt}
  6801: If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!${prompt}
  6802: If you type “/ae Hello!”, then your message will be heard by many people.${prompt}
  6803: If you type “/ae” followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!${prompt}
  6804: Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!${prompt}
  6805: |-
    Okay, kupo!
    Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!${prompt}
  6806: Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?${prompt}

    Master!

  7275: Seuls les honorables peuvent servir San d’Oria dans toute sa gloire. Nous n’avons pas besoin de vagabonds pour diluer nos rangs.${prompt}
  7276: Finis tes affaires et quitte notre ville !${prompt}
  7277: Cela fait vingt ans que mon fils a rejoint les Chevaliers du Temple… Et Ronfaure est toujours infesté d’Orcs !${prompt}
  7278: Tout ça, c’est la faute de ces Chevaliers Royaux ! Le Prince Trion pense-t-il défaire tout ce que mon fils a accompli ? Vraiment ?${prompt}

  7280: Quand les Portes du Paradis s’ouvriront, l’Élue guidera tous les San d’Oriens vers son utopie céleste.${prompt}
  7281: Lors de la guerre il y a vingt ans, les chevaliers de San d’Oria ont écrasé le Seigneur des Ombres et ses hordes. Nous avons scellé les Terres du Nord d’où il venait.${prompt}
  7282: Hein ? Windurst et Bastok ? Ils pouvaient à peine protéger leurs portes ! Sans la vaillance de nos chevaliers, tout serait tombé dans l’ombre !${prompt}

  7285: Hrmm… Tu as l’air d’un autre aventurier obsédé par les épées brillantes et les boucliers étincelants. Ai-je tort ?${prompt}
  7286: Eh bien, la marque d’un aventurier, c’est une demeure richement décorée. Vraiment, tu dois visiter la boutique de meubles !${prompt}
  7287: Nous combattons les Orcs depuis des années ! Et pourtant, leurs rangs ne diminuent pas.${prompt}

  7554: Prince Trion, is there something you wish to add?${prompt}
  7555: |-
    ...
    I will not deny that the participation of adventurers has been of great benefit to the conquest, as well as maintained a new level of safety in the outlying regions.${prompt}
  7556: In addition, the many treaties signed by our nations have successfully paved a path of peace. No longer need our border guards fear attacks from our friends to the south and east.${prompt}
  7557: However, the beastman forces display no signs of weakening. Those noble guards stationed in faraway lands must deal with this reality constantly...and the burden has begun taking its toll.${prompt}
  7558: The already large gap between the guards on our borders and the guards in the Outlands expands with each day. If nothing is done, morale shall continue to fall while discontent grows.${prompt}
  7559: I sense that my kingdom is not alone in these worries.${prompt}
  7560: Soldier morale...${prompt}

  7566: |-
    Doctor Shantotto...
    I fully understand the concerns of Prince Trion, and believe he has a point.${prompt}
  7567: In a republic like Bastok, where a large portion of our army is made up of normal citizens, it is easy for morale levels to slide. This is a problem that is constantly being tackled by our officials.${prompt}

    Really?
    Well, that's your nation. Windurst doesn't face such problems.${prompt}

  7576: Yes, but hiring mercenaries can be quite the burden on the Federation's treasury, can it not?${prompt}
  7577: The more regions under your nation's control, the more mercenaries you must hire. And before you realize it, your vaults will be empty.${prompt}
  7578: I suspect that the conquest is taking its toll on the Federation.${prompt}
  7579: Well, we...${prompt}

    I would not trust a lump of rubbish made by one of you lunatics any more than I would trust one of you lunatics!${prompt}

  7594: |-
    Prince Trion.
    You certainly did not bring up this issue without having a solution in mind.${prompt}
  7595: |-
    Exactly!
    You'd better have something interesting to say.
    Or Ajido and I will pack up our things and be on our way.${prompt}
  7596: Recently one of our Royal Knights made his return journey from our kingdom's territories to the north--Lord Excenmille.${prompt}
  7597: Excenmille? The man who, after the Great War, took a handful of soldiers and successfully invaded the Orcish Empire using guerilla tactics?${prompt}
  7598: |-
    Yes.
    Sword in hand, donning armor stained with the blood of a thousand foes, he returned to his homeland for the first time in twenty years...and was shocked at what he found lurking beyond its gates.${prompt}
  7599: Foreign merchants of all shapes and sizes peddling their trinkets. Scruffy adventurers shouting out their petty problems as they walked freely among the streets and alleys. Local shopkeeps and Temple Knights laughing as they mingled with the scum washed up from all corners of the continent.${prompt}
  7600: Excenmille was furious.${prompt}
  7601: Why would he be furious? The influx of adventurers has revitalized your nation.${prompt}
  7602: According to Excenmille, twenty-five years ago, a union among the children of Altana was necessary to defeat the armies of darkness.${prompt}
  7603: However, now that the threat has gone, there is no reason for San d'Oria's citizens to be brushing shoulders with the common folk of other nations. It is this symbiotic relationship that plagues the Kingdom and keeps the once mighty red lion shackled down.${prompt}
  7604: That seems like quite an anachronous opinion...${prompt}
  7605: Excenmille's way of thinking may seem out-of-date, but his logic cannot be denied. Ever since the opening of our gates to outsiders, the quality of our knights has fallen dramatically.${prompt}
  7606: |-
    ...
    I'm tired of hearing stories about some pumpkin-bumpkin knight.
    Are you going to get to the point, or are we going to be here all night?${prompt}
  7607: Excenmille offered me with the following suggestion...${prompt}
  7608: Revive Conflict!${prompt}
  7609: '...${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  7610: '...!?${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  7611: |-
    C-Conflict!?

  7612: |-
    Due to the extreme level of danger involved, it was banned well before the Great War.
    You are not suggesting that we reinstate Conflict, are you?${prompt}
  7613: That is what I propose.${prompt}
  7614: |-
    Conflict...
    An interesting idea...${prompt}
  7615: There was once a time when Conflict ignited the spirits of the people of Bastok--players and fans alike.${prompt}
  7616: However, after numerous “accidents,” the games were deemed a bad influence on the Republic's image, and were banned by law.${prompt}
  7617: If Conflict was reinstated, it could re-ignite the flames in the hearts of all Bastokers and renew their faith in the Republican Army. Morale would be restored, and our problems solved.${prompt}
  7618: |-
    Prince Trion, Prince Trion.
    If that's all that you wanted to say,
    you didn't have to go beat around the bush all day.${prompt}

    Windurst welcomes Conflict with open arms!
    A little feuding fun could do no harm.${prompt}
  7620: Shantotto!?${prompt}
  7621: |-
    Oh, there's nothing to get all excited about. The forces of Windurst are in good hands.
    A couple of knutty knights and measly musketeers are no match for Shantotto's superior battle plans.${prompt}

  7630: |-
    I have no objections.
    Now let us return to our nations and begin with the preparations.${prompt}
  7631: |-
    Then it has been decided.

  7632: |-
    Ahem.
    Then, if there is nothing further, I call the 136th Conquest Evaluation Assembly to a close.${prompt}

    Nothing at the moment.${prompt}
  7637: Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word “ballista” means “to throw a stone,” and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.${prompt}
  7638: |-
    The rules are simple.
    Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.${prompt}
  7639: 'Players from both teams must search for ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} that a ${color: 5}Herald${color: 1} has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  7640: 'These ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} into them.${prompt}'
  7641: Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.${prompt}
  7642: '${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the ${color: 5}Quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.${prompt}'
  7643: 'Sometimes a player may find items other than ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}, such as potions. These ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).${prompt}'
  7644: |-
    Players can carry more than one ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them.
    However, players will lose their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} if they:
    (1) Successfully throw them into a rook.

    ${color: 5}Best of Three${color: 1} series rules are as follows:
    Winning a match will earn a nation one “match point.” The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for “come-from-behind” victories.${prompt}
  7660: Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.${prompt}
  7661: Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.${prompt}
  7662: When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.${prompt}
  7663: For more information on temporary items, refer to the “special rules.”${prompt}
  7664: After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.${prompt}

    Tu penses être assez ${choice-player-gender}[homme/femme] pour rejoindre les forces de Conflict de notre nation !?${prompt}
  7769: Mais tu es encore un misérable vermisseau qui n’a rien fait pour la République ! Reviens quand ton rang sera au moins plus élevé que ton QI !${prompt}
  7770: Je te surveillerai, soldat !${prompt}
  7771: |-
    Ton allure…
    Ta tenue…
    Un aventurier, je présume.
    Es-tu venu pour t’inscrire au Conflict ?${prompt}
  7772: Permets-moi de me présenter. Je suis Excenmille M Aurchiat, Commandant par intérim des forces de Conflict de San d’Oria.${prompt}
  7773: J’ai entendu de bonnes choses à ton sujet, ${name-player}. Ta loyauté envers la couronne est bien connue à travers le Royaume.${prompt}
  7774: Je crois que tu serais un excellent ajout à nos rangs, et je t’accueille avec plaisir.${prompt}
  7775: Tu es venu pour t’inscrire au Conflict, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7776: Eh bien, avant que tu ne prennes une décision hâtive, laisse-moi t’expliquer les détails de ce qui s’est passé ces derniers mois.${prompt}
  7777: Tout a commencé lors de la dernière Assemblée d’Évaluation de la Conquête, tenue en conjonction avec la Convention Internationale du Commerce. Sa Majesté, le Prince Trion, a fait la proposition suivante…${prompt}
  7778: |-
    As-tu compris ?
    C’est de moi que parlait le prince. Et c’est moi qui crois que ta loyauté, ton courage et tes compétences inégalés sont nécessaires pour la victoire du Royaume.${prompt}
  7779: Si tu es véritablement un serviteur de la couronne, tu ne t’opposeras pas à brandir ton épée au nom des royaulais.${prompt}
  7780: |-
    Je vois…
    Je réalise que vous, les aventuriers, avez d’autres affaires qui vous occupent.
    Cependant, n’oublie pas la dette que tu as envers le Royaume qui te soutient.${prompt}
  7781: Attends une minute, ne me dis rien… Tu es l’un des aventuriers de la Fédération, n’est-ce pas ? Et tu veux t’inscrire au Conflict ?${prompt}
  7782: |-
    Hmmm…
    Ton rang semble assez élevé… OK ! Tu es prrris.
    J’ai besoin d’un vétéran comme toi pour remettre en forme certains de mes jeunes mercenaires.${prompt}
  7783: Je m’appelle Mhabi Molkot. Jusqu’à il y a quelques jours, j’étais Capitaine des Terrible Tigresses, le groupe de Mercenaires Mithra le plus crrraint de tout Windurst !${prompt}
  7784: Et puis, tout d’un coup, ils m’ont nommée Commandante de Conflict…${prompt}
  7785: |-
    Bref, j’ai dit que tu es prrris, alors tu es déjà prrris !
    Quoi ? Ne me dis pas que tu as des doutes maintenant !${prompt}
  7786: Laisse-moi te raconter un peu ce qui s’est passé ces derniers mois. Tout a commmmencé lors d’une conférence ennuyeuse pour parler de la conquête…${prompt}
  7787: Et voilà. Les gros bonnets des ministères ont probablement entenduuu que j’étais une joueuse professionnelle de Conflict dans mon pays natal, et m’ont confiiié les rênes de ce cheval emballé.${prompt}
  7788: Peut-être que c’est mon instinct qui parle, mais tu as l’air du genre qui meurt d’envie de participer à la chasse. Qu’en dis-tu ?${prompt}
  7789: |-
    ${choice-player-gender}[Hmph. Eh bien, tu as du cran. Tu es le premier homme à avoir jamais refusé cette chatte./Tu me refuses ?]
    Mais je sais que tu reviendras. Je peux le voir dans tes yeux…${prompt}
  7790: |-
    Quoi !?
    Tu penses être assez ${choice-player-gender}[homme/femme] pour rejoindre les forces de Conflict de notre nation !?${prompt}
  7791: Tu crois que juste parce que tu as quelques missions à ton actif, tu es prêt à jouer avec les grands !?${prompt}
  7792: Eh bien, soldat, j’ai raclé des choses plus grosses que toi sous ma botte !${prompt}
  7793: |-
    Écoutez bien !
    Je m’appelle Invincible Shield, Légat de la troisième division de la Légion Républicaine.${prompt}
  7794: Le président lui-même m’a nommé Commandant de Conflict et a placé les forces de Bastok sous mon contrôle. Si tu rejoins, tu serviras sous mes ordres, et uniquement sous mes ordres !${prompt}
  7795: |-
    Quoi !? Tu as des questions sur le Conflict !?
    Je ne me souviens pas que quelqu’un t’ait donné la permission de poser des questions, soldat !${prompt}
  7796: |-
    Je vais laisser passer pour cette fois, mais que ça ne se reproduise pas !
    Maintenant, écoute bien !${prompt}
  7797: |-
    As-tu compris ce que je viens de te dire !?
    C’est un honneur et un privilège de participer au Conflict !${prompt}
  7798: |-
    Tu veux être un héros !? Eh bien, voici ta chance, soldat !
    Signe ce formulaire de candidature et tu pourras partir !${prompt}
  7799: |-
    Plus de temps !?
    Et moi qui pensais que tu étais plus qu’un pleurnichard !
    La République n’a pas besoin de faibles comme toi !
    Tu es congédié !${prompt}
  7800: Alors, tu as enfin réalisé ta dette envers le Royaume et décidé de la rembourser par un service dans le Conflict ?${prompt}
  7801: Eh bien, regardez qui est de retour. Je savais que tu ne pourrais pas rrrésister à l’excitation du Conflict. Tu es prêt à t’inscrire, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7802: |-
    Je vois que tu as enfin repris tes esprits, soldat !
    Maintenant, signe cette candidature et tu pourras partir !${prompt}
  7803: |-
    Excellent.
    Cependant, il y a une dernière tâche que je dois te demander d’accomplir avant d’approuver ta candidature.${prompt}
  7804: Rends-toi à Bastok et Windurst et rencontre leurs dirigeants. Ne t’inquiète pas des détails, ils savent déjà que tu viendras.${prompt}
  7805: Je souhaite également que tu livres ces lettres aux Commandants de Conflict des deux nations.${prompt}
  7806: Un Galka imposant, Ginu… Invincible Shield, t’attendra à Bastok.${prompt}
  7807: Et je me souviens que la Commandante des forces de Windurst était une Mithra nommée Mhabi… quelque chose comme ça. J’ai tellement de mal à me souvenir des noms étrangers.${prompt}
  7808: |-
    That is all. You may set off immediately.
    I must say, I am quite honored to send such a fine adventurer as yourself to represent the Kingdom.${prompt}
  7809: |-
    Wonderful!
    I know you'rrre ready to get out there and starrrt fighting right away, but before you do, you'rrre going to need a license.${prompt}
  7810: To get a license, you'll need to meet the leaders of the other two nations.${prompt}
  7811: And--you thought that was it?--you'll need to take these letters to the Conflict Commanders of San d'Oria and Bastok.${prompt}
  7812: I don't know much about the two, but the Commander of Bastok is some thousand-year-old gut-busterrr named Invincible Shield. I think I rememberrr the one from San d'Oria being some cold-blooded Elvaan named Excenmille.${prompt}
  7813: Now get going! The faster you get this done, the quicker you can be exchanging blows with those boneheads from the other nations!${prompt}
  7814: |-
    Heh heh heh...
    When they see who I've sent to them, they'll be shaking in their greaves!${prompt}
  7815: |-
    You've made the right choice, soldier!
    From this day on, you are an official member of the Bastokan Conflict forces!${prompt}
  7816: |-
    Now listen up, because I'm about to give you your first orders, and I'm only going to say them once!
    You are to infiltrate the enemies' cities and meet with their leaders!${prompt}
  7817: |-
    What!?
    Who are the enemy? Where have you been the last twenty-five years, living in a hole!?
    The enemy are the Elvaan and the Tarutaru!${prompt}
  7818: |-
    After meeting with their leaders, you are to deliver these correspondences to the Conflict Commanders of those nations!
    Don't worry, you'll have no trouble finding those half-rate cowards!${prompt}
  7819: |-
    Look for Excenmille in San d'Oria and Mhabi in Windurst!
    Just the sound of their names makes me want to puke!${prompt}
  7820: |-
    You have your orders, now make your final preparations and be on your way! You have ten, no, eight minutes!
    Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7821: Is something the matter? You are to meet the leaders of Bastok and Windurst.${prompt}
  7822: Also, give the letters I handed you to the Conflict Commanders Invincible Shield and Mhabi...something-or-other.${prompt}
  7823: What's wrong? Hurry up and meet the leaders of Bastok and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  7824: Oh, and don't forrrget to give my letters to Invincible Shield and Excenmille.${prompt}
  7825: Don't even tell me that you forgot your orders! I've met tunnel worms with better memories than you!${prompt}
  7826: |-
    Now listen up, soldier!
    After meeting with the leaders of San d'Oria and Windurst, you are to deliver the correspondences I handed you to the Conflict Commanders Excenmille and Mhabi Molkot!
    And I don't want to see your pathetic face until you've completed your mission! Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7827: |-
    Welcome back from your journey.
    ......A ha ha ha! So old Ginuva was not pleased with the content of my letter. I can just imagine how he must have looked after reading it.${prompt}
  7828: |-
    Well done, ${name-player}.
    Now, all that remains is for you to pledge your loyalty before the royaulais. Proceed immediately to the chateau. We would not want to keep His Highness waiting.${prompt}
  7829: |-
    Welcome back! I was beginning to worrrry that you got lost!
    ...Heh heh heh! Those two buffoons were rubbed the wrong way by my letters? Hah hah! Thanks, ${name-player}. You've just made my day.${prompt}
  7830: Now, all that's left is for you to talk to little Kupipi over there and have her take you to the Star Sibyl. When you'rrre done, you can tell me more about your trip.${prompt}
  7831: |-
    Well done, soldier!
    I can tell by the look on your face that those two sissies in Windurst and San d'Oria weren't pleased with the letters I had you deliver. Well, that's too bad!${prompt}
  7832: |-
    If a leader cannot stay calm in a tense situation, he'll pay for it with his men's lives!
    Don't you forget that, soldier!${prompt}
  7833: |-
    Now make your way to the President's Office! Without our leader's permission, you are nothing more than a mangy dog in a uniform!
    Get moving!${prompt}
  7834: 'I commend you, ${name-player}. You have done well in completing the tasks I set before you. You shall make a fine soldier. Now let me present you with your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7835: This license allows you participation in the traditional San d'Orian battle exercise known as Ballista.${prompt}
  7836: As this sport has its origins in our kingdom, anything less than victory shall not be accepted.${prompt}
  7837: |-
    Ah, I almost forgot.
    Currently, the reinstatement of Conflict is only temporary. Much has changed since it was first followed many years ago.${prompt}
  7838: |-
    Because of this, there is a great chance that many of the existing rules may be changed, and the whole system outlawed for good. If you have any opinions on the games, I suggest you are vocal with them.
    That is all.${prompt}
  7839: 'OK! You''rrre done. Here''s your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  7840: With this license, you'll be able to parrrticipate in one of San d'Oria's old Conflict events--Ballista. I would have preferrrred something more exciting--more Mithran--but I guess this will have to do for now.${prompt}
  7841: And no matter the game, the best will always win, so we have nothing to worry about! Right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  7842: |-
    Oh yeah, I almost forgot...
    Conflict's rrreinstatement still isn't one hundred percent official. I don't know what those politicians are worrrried about, but I guess that's why I'm not a politician.${prompt}
  7843: They did say something about changing the rules if the players werrre not satisfied with the current ones. So remember to speak up if you want your voice hearrrd!${prompt}
  7844: |-
    Well done, soldier!
    I expect the best, and I give the best! Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}
  7845: The Ballista License authorizes your participation in the San d'Orian battle exercise known by the same name.${prompt}
  7846: We must meet the enemy with our blood, our valor, our very lives, to prove to the world that the forces of the Republic are undefeatable!${prompt}
  7847: In addition, you are not to forget that the rules of Conflict are subject to change without notice!${prompt}
  7848: |-
    While I don't think it is a good idea, the IRNC has decided to listen to the opinions of you adventurers in order to improve Ballista. I say, if you can't take the heat, then stay out of the kitchen!
    Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7849: I happen to be carrying with me a revised edition of the Ballista rulebook. Listen carefully...${prompt}
  7850: |-
    All right, soldier, listen up!
    Repeat after me the following rules!${prompt}
  7851: Though I'm not one to really follow the rules, I guess it's good that one of us knows them...${prompt}
  7852: An exquisite display of force, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7853: It was as if I were watching a battle fought by the Dragon King himself!${prompt}
  7854: Great job out there, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7855: The dodging and slicing and dashing and slicing. I couldn't have done better myself!${prompt}
  7856: |-
    Excellent work, soldier! The president was pleased to hear of our victory!
    But do not think that the enemy will take their defeat lightly. They will be back, and they will win unless you stop them!${prompt}
  7857: |-
    Now get back out there, soldier!
    Do you want to live forever!?${prompt}
  7858: |-
    Unthinkable...
    A loss to those wretched Tarutaru and their pet kittens.${prompt}
  7859: If our forces cannot even defeat those cowards, then there is no future for our kingdom. I expect more from you in the next match, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7860: |-
    I cannot believe what I am hearing...
    A loss to those uneducated Humes and their brainless Galka pets...${prompt}
  7861: Another defeat at the hands of those materialistic fiends will surely spell disaster for the future of our kingdom. I expect more from you in the next match, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  7862: You lost to those arrogant ignoramuses!? How could you lose to those arrogant...${prompt}
  7863: |-
    Ahem!
    Don't let it happen again, ${name-player}! You'rrre making me look bad!${prompt}
  7864: |-
    Hissssss!
    You couldn't even beat Bastok? You couldn't even beat...${prompt}
  7865: |-
    Ahem!
    Don't let it happen again, ${name-player}, or I'll scrrratch one of your eyes out!${prompt}
  7866: |-
    Defeat is an unavoidable aspect of battle!
    What separates the true victors from the losers lies in how the defeated handle their loss!${prompt}
  7867: |-
    Why did you fail!?
    What did you do wrong!?
    And how are you going to make sure these things don't happen in the next battle!?
    Do not make me repeat these words, ${name-player}! Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7868: |-
    Defeat is an unavoidable aspect of battle!
    You suffered the pain of failure because you were outmatched!
    But remember, soldier, pain is only in your mind!${prompt}
  7869: |-
    Why did you fail!?
    What did you do wrong!?
    And how are you going to make sure these things don't happen in the next battle!?
    Know yourself and your enemy, and you will win! Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7870: I must have underestimated the skill of our rival nation's forces...${prompt}
  7871: Ha ha! We must consider ourselves lucky to have found such a worthy opponent. However, next time I can assure you San d'Oria will have the upper hand!${prompt}
  7872: |-
    A draw!
    A draw is worse than being defeated, soldier! It means both forces didn't have what it takes to be a winner!${prompt}
  7873: |-
    You're lucky Ballista is just an exercise, because if this were the real thing, you'd be lying dead in the mud! Now get back out there and don't let this happen again!
    Dismissed!${prompt}
  7874: So close, yet so farrr...${prompt}
  7875: Tell me we're closer than farrrer, right?${prompt}
  7876: 'You wish to know about the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? Yes, this device can be of great assistance on the battlefield.${prompt}'
  7877: While wearing it, you will be able to hear the orders of our nation's Pursuivant. His advice should aid you in battle.${prompt}
  7878: You will also have the opportunity to obtain details of upcoming matches while visiting any of the four nations.${prompt}
  7879: |-
    You want to see this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? Here, take a look.
    These things arrre pretty useful. I often worrre one back when I was a pro.${prompt}
  7880: When you have it on, you'll be able to hearrr orders from Windurst's Pursuivant. He'll tell you what to do when you'rrre in a pinch.${prompt}
  7881: He'll also give you important info on upcoming matches when you'rrre in any of the four nations.${prompt}
  7882: |-
    Listen up, soldier!
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]} will not guarantee you victory, but it can make the difference in a close battle!${prompt}
  7883: In the heat of combat, soldiers can become disoriented! This earring will relay commands from Bastok's Pursuivant to you. You listen to him, you'll live! You don't, you won't!${prompt}
  7884: And if you're lucky, he just may give you valuable data on the upcoming matches while your back in the barracks!${prompt}
  7885: |-
    Ask for an earring?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  7886: A wise decision, ${name-player}. May the words of the Pursuivant guide you and our kingdom to victory.${prompt}
  7887: |-
    Here, let me put it on for you.
    Hmmm...
    You look great!
    Now there's nothing that can stop Windurst!${prompt}
  7888: |-
    Smart move, soldier!
    Now if you fall in battle, you will have no one to blame but yourself!${prompt}
  7889: I see. Well, I cannot force you to wear one.${prompt}
  7890: Well, if you think that you don't need one...${prompt}
  7891: If you think you've got what it takes to win without an earring, then I won't force you to wear one! However, don't come crying to me if you want one later!${prompt}
  7892: 'What is this? Perhaps you no longer require the assistance of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  7893: 'How''s the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} worrrking? Or maybe you don''t need it anymore. I could always take it off your hands.${prompt}'
  7894: 'Is there something wrong with your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!?${prompt}'
  7895: |-
    Return the earring?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  7896: Ah, so you are ready to stand on your own two feet. I wish all the best in your further matches.${prompt}
  7897: Really? But it looked so good on you... Oh well, if you ever need another, you know where I am.${prompt}
  7898: |-
    Well, it's about time!
    I was beginning to wonder when you'd let go of mommy's hand and start to walk on your own!
    Dismissed!!!${prompt}
  7899: |-
    What is this?
    I have no interest in chatting with a lowly member of the Federation. Why don't you return to your petty nation and frolic with your feline friends?${prompt}
  7900: |-
    ???
    If you haven't noticed, this is not San d'Oria. If you want to sign up for Conflict, I suggest you head back to Ronfaure.${prompt}
  7901: |-
    Does this look like Windurst, maggot!?
    If you do not leave these premises in ten seconds, I will be inclined to use force!
    Move! Move! Move!${prompt}
  7902: |-
    What is this?
    I have no interest in chatting with a lowly member of the Republic. If you do not leave immediately, I'll be forced to call the Temple Knights and have you arrested for impiety to the crown!${prompt}
  7903: |-
    Are you talking to me?
    Are you talking to me?
    Well, you can keep talking, but don't think I'll be listening. I don't have any business with a Bastoker.${prompt}
  7904: |-
    What is that smell!?
    Why, it's a San d'Orian adventurer!
    If you have the time to waste talking to me, you should be out thinking of a way to overthrow that crazy family that is denying your country its freedoms!${prompt}
  7905: |-
    Ah, I see that you were successful in receiving your license...
    I look forward to seeing you on the battlefield.${prompt}
  7906: Well, well, well! They even gave you a license. Your country must be really desperate...${prompt}
  7907: |-
    Where did you find that license, soldier!? It is against IRNC law to be in possession another soldier's documentation!
    What!? That is your license!? Ha! Ha! Ha!${prompt}
  7908: Ah, so you are applying to participate in the Conflict?${prompt}
  7909: |-
    You may proceed to the chateau and meet with King Destin. The royaulais is in his chambers.
    However, if I hear of any tomfoolery, I will personally behead you and present your skull to the Heralds for use in Ballista.${prompt}
  7910: |-
    Wait, don't tell me...
    You'rrre applying for participation in Conflict!?
    (Hah! A few more players like this and Windurst is guarrranteed victory!)${prompt}
  7911: |-
    Oh, I'm sorry, did you hearrr that?
    Well, never mind. You see that cute Tarutaru, Kupipi, over there? You just talk to her and she'll take you to the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
  7912: |-
    So this is the type of garbage the other two nations are enlisting!?
    It makes me sick to see San d'Oria and Windurst not take these exercises seriously!${prompt}
  7913: I wouldn't think that the president would give scum like you approval to participate in the Conflict, but your appointment has already been made. Now move it!${prompt}
  7914: What is that? A letter from that rat, Ginuva? Hand it over!${prompt}
  7915: |-
    .........
    How dare he even think of mentioning the Second Battle of Konschtat!${prompt}
  7916: |-
    You!
    Tell your commander that I accept his challenge, and that this time history shall not repeat itself!${prompt}
  7917: A letter from Bastok? Here, let me see that...${prompt}
  7918: |-
    .........
    Grrrrrr! The nerrrve of that Galka... Did he think that after sending such a letter, I'd send you back to your nation in anything less than a body bag!?${prompt}
  7919: Hm? You had no idea of what was in the letter? Well, then you take this message back to your precious Broken Shield--tell that old bloke that I'll show him the quickest path to rrreincarnation!${prompt}
  7920: What is this!? A letter from that punk, Excenmille!?${prompt}
  7921: |-
    .........
    If he thinks that I...${prompt}
  7922: |-
    You!
    You tell that good-for-nothing commander of yours that youth won't protect him from the back of my axe!
    Now get out of my face!!!${prompt}
  7923: A letter from a Federation Mercenary Captain? Hand it over!${prompt}
  7924: |-
    .........
    I am useless and I should have stayed in the Northlands to rot... Preposterous!${prompt}
  7925: |-
    You!
    Tell your mercenary commander that I accept her petty challenge! Her pathetic claws will not even dent my armor!${prompt}
  7926: A letter from Lord Excenmille? And it's not even my birthday!${prompt}
  7927: |-
    .........
    Grrrrrr! What does he mean, amateurrr!? Ballista's a game, and I was the best! Battle experrrience has nothing to do with anything!${prompt}
  7928: |-
    You!
    You tell that pompous pighead that twenty yearrrs of playing in the snow with the Orcs won't help him in Conflict! My merrrcenaries will be all over him in a second!${prompt}
  7929: |-
    What is that you have there, maggot!?
    A shopping list from your mommy!?${prompt}
  7930: |-
    .........
    Th...vixen...sh...I...ki...${prompt}
  7931: |-
    You!
    You tell that worthless commander of yours that she can scream and she can cry, but I will show her no mercy on the battlefield!
    Now get out of my face!!!${prompt}
  7932: |-
    Excellent show, ${name-player}!
    I have just received word that ${choice: 0}[you were awarded a chevron of excellence/you were the high scorer in San d'Oria's last match].${prompt}
  7933: I knew from the moment that I laid eyes on you that you would not let the Kingdom down; I just did not expect that it would be so soon. I salute you!${prompt}
  7934: I just received the news, ${name-player}! It seems like you did an outstanding job at tearing up the battlefield during the last Ballista match.${prompt}

  11130: Une recrue ? Renforce ton bras armé et ta stature de chevalier. Ainsi, tu serviras au mieux la gloire de notre grand royaume.${prompt}
  11131: San d’Oria a déjà bien assez de soldats, frère. À ce propos, ne devrais-tu pas être en train de les entraîner, au lieu de déranger les nouvelles recrues avec des discours sur la guerre ?${prompt}

  11133: Vraiment, Pieuje ! Est-ce une manière de parler à ton frère ?${prompt}

  11149: En ce moment, nous sommes sur les Terrains de Parade. Trouve la porte à l’ouest.${prompt}
  11150: Passe par là, dépasse le magasin de meubles et l’auberge. Prends la porte à gauche.${prompt}
  11151: Tourne encore à gauche en descendant les escaliers. Tu verras la Porte Ranperre au-delà.${prompt}
  11152: Si tu as besoin d’indications, demande aux gens autour de toi. Nos citoyens sont amicaux, pour la plupart.${prompt}

  11157: |-
    Sur quoi veux-tu en savoir plus ?
    ${selection-lines}

  11160: Le sud de San d’Oria est juste après l’Arche de la Victoire là-bas. Passe par là et va à l’ouest. Tu trouveras la Guilde des Tanneurs assez vite.${prompt}
  11161: De l’argent facile, hein ? Typique ! Je ne peux pas promettre que ce sera facile, mais va voir le chantier de bois sur le Chemin des Travailleurs. Ils devraient avoir du travail pour toi.${prompt}
  11162: Passe par la porte à l’ouest et dépasse l’Auberge du Perchoir de Phénix. Tu devrais voir une autre porte à ta droite. Cette porte mène au Chemin des Travailleurs.${prompt}
  11163: Ah, un choix louable ! Chaque entrée de la ville a un poste de garde. Dis aux gardes là-bas que tu veux travailler pour la gloire du Royaume !${prompt}
  11164: Tiens, prends ça. C’est un coupon d’aventurier. Donne-le à Matildie devant le Château d’Oraguille.${prompt}

  11168: En parlant d’argent, je n’ai pas vu ce joueur toute la journée. S’est-il encore enfui ?${prompt}
  11169: Tu le connais. Je parie qu’il est en train de parcourir les Terrains de Parade à la recherche de pigeons avec des gils à parier.${prompt}
  11170: Pour qui se prend-il, à s’enfuir alors qu’on a des tonnes de travail à faire ! Je vais lui donner une bonne correction quand il reviendra !${prompt}
  11171: Le jeu, c’est la ruine de beaucoup, je te le dis…${prompt}
  11172: Un joueur ? Oh, tu veux dire Varchet. Il est passé par l’Arche de la Victoire il y a un moment.${prompt}
  11173: Il est probablement dans une taverne à l’heure qu’il est. Tu ferais mieux de rester loin des joueurs comme lui.${prompt}
  11174: Il était chevalier, autrefois, et il a toujours aimé les jeux de hasard. On dit que son habitude lui a finalement coûté son titre de chevalier.${prompt}
  11175: Hé, c’est cette recrue de tout à l’heure. Alors c’est toi qui as fait revenir Varchet !${prompt}
  11176: Je ne me souviens pas de t’avoir demandé de le ramener, mais je te dois mes remerciements quand même. Tiens, prends ça !${prompt}
  11177: Hein ? Ce joueur, Varchet ? Oui, il était juste ici.${prompt}
  11178: Varchet ? Je lui ai donné une bonne correction pour ce qu’il a fait, et puis il s’est encore enfui ! On ne peut pas lui faire confiance, à celui-là.${prompt}
  11179: Un magasin de magie, dis-tu ? Un peu de magie serait utile… Je sais ! Je vais demander à ma fille de l’étudier pour moi !${prompt}

  11270: La providence viendra avec le renoncement à l’avidité. Le seul trésor que nous pouvons garder est la générosité !${prompt}
  11271: Maintenant, je me souviens d’un frère en retraite à Ronfaure Est.${prompt}
  11272: Il passe ses journées à jeûner en prière, ne s’arrêtant que pour manger des pois bleus.${prompt}
  11273: En révérence à sa dévotion, apportons-lui de la subsistance !${prompt}
  11274: Adresse-toi au Frère Abioleget au narthex, afin qu’il te confie les pois.${prompt}
  11275: Renonce à tout désir, donne-toi à Altana, et elle te bénira dans sa gloire.${prompt}
  11276: Et avec ces mots, je vous envoie. Que sa lumière brille sur vous, toujours.${prompt}
  11277: 'Je te fournirai ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} pour une modique somme de ${number: 1} gil.${prompt}'
  11278: 'Prends ce ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Dans une tour à Ronfaure Est, tu trouveras le frère.${prompt}'
  11279: Tu porteras les pois au frère, et tu reviendras ici.${prompt}
  11280: Nous reconnaissons ta conviction. Aujourd’hui, tu es un pas plus près du Paradis !${prompt}
  11281: Pour honorer ta dévotion, je t’accorde cette bénédiction.${prompt}
  11282: Va voir le Frère Abioleget au narthex pour qu’il entende parler de ton service. Vite, maintenant !${prompt}
  11283: Va maintenant, mon enfant. Sache dans ton cœur qu’Altana veille sur toi.${prompt}
  11284: Voici l’entrée de la tour de guet, qui surplombe les bois de Ronfaure.${prompt}
  11285: Tu es de garde aujourd’hui ? Quel est le mot de passe, alors ?${prompt}
  11286: Tu es nouveau ici, n’est-ce pas ? D’abord, cible-moi, puis tape /pass motdepasse, où “motdepasse” est le mot de passe, compris ?${prompt}
  11287: Ça me suffit. Suis les instructions du garde une fois à l’intérieur, et tout ira bien.${prompt}
  11288: －－見張り塔内部へゾーンします－－${prompt}

  11297: J’étudie les écritures afin que, moi aussi, je puisse un jour donner des sermons comme le Vicasque Arnau.${prompt}
  11298: Dans cette salle, nous étudions les enseignements d’Altana. C’est par des années de prière et de dévotion que nous avons gagné ce droit.${prompt}
  11299: À propos, j’ai entendu parler de tes exploits, et j’aimerais te demander une petite faveur.${prompt}
  11300: L’un des membres de notre ordre est en retraite au Pic de Holla. Pourrais-tu lui apporter des parchemins pour son prochain cercle ?${prompt}
  11301: Quel dommage ! Je crains que ta place au Paradis ne soit en péril.${prompt}
  11302: 'Grande est la générosité dans ton cœur ! Prends ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} et porte-le au Frère Faurbellant au Pic de Holla.${prompt}'

  11307: Je suis pressé, mon brave ! J’ai besoin de cinq épées en fer, et vite !${prompt}
  11308: Je peux faire ce que je peux, pas plus.${prompt}
  11309: C’est le capitaine lui-même qui me l’a ordonné ! Nous envoyons une troupe dans les Plaines de Batallia demain, et ils ont besoin de lames !${prompt}
  11310: Peu m’importe qui a ordonné quoi ! Je ne peux pas fabriquer des lames sans fer, n’est-ce pas ? Si tu les veux tant, apporte-moi du métal !${prompt}
  11311: Arrêtez tout de suite, tous les deux. C’est un lieu de commerce ici !${prompt}
  11312: Hmph… Tu as raison. Mais comment vais-je obtenir le fer ?${prompt}
  11313: Pourquoi ne pas simplement prendre des armes aux Orcs de Ghelsba ? Faire d’une pierre deux coups, comme ça.${prompt}
  11314: Tu veux dire, fondre les armes orques pour en faire de nouvelles ? Voilà une idée. Combien en faudrait-il ?${prompt}
  11315: Hmm… Je dirais une dizaine de couteaux, à une lame près.${prompt}
  11316: Alors la vitesse est notre alliée ! Vite, toi, va dans la forêt, et moi, je vais faire un rapport au capitaine.${prompt}
  11317: Hein ? Je suis forgeron ! Je fabrique des épées, je ne les utilise pas ! Je ne vais pas me battre contre des Orcs.${prompt}
  11318: Surveille ton langage, forgeron insolent ! Sais-tu qui je suis ? Je suis le Seigneur Ancolain, officier des Chevaliers Royaux !${prompt}
  11319: Vraiment, comportez-vous correctement ! Pourquoi ne pas simplement trouver un aventurier pour faire le travail ?${prompt}
  11320: Les choses ne sont généralement pas aussi rudes par ici, vraiment. Dis-moi, on dirait un aventurier, toi aussi. Qu’en dis-tu ?${prompt}
  11321: Tu es un aventurier, n’est-ce pas ? Comme tu as pu l’entendre, nous avons besoin de tes services.${prompt}

  11323: Eh bien… Les aventuriers de nos jours ! Trop occupés pour tendre une main secourable.${prompt}
  11324: Écoute bien, il y a beaucoup d’Orcs dans les camps de Ghelsba, et certains portent des couteaux.${prompt}
  11325: Pourrais-tu ramasser dix de ces couteaux et les apporter ici ? Nous n’avons pas beaucoup de temps.${prompt}
  11326: Comment vas-tu ? As-tu récupéré les couteaux ?${prompt}

  11332: Ne vois-tu pas que je suis occupé ? Si tu as une affaire, parle-moi plus tard.${prompt}
  11333: On dirait que cet officier est dans une situation délicate. Peut-être pourrais-tu l’aider, hein ?${prompt}
  11334: Cet officier chantait tes louanges. Oui, tu as l’étoffe d’un excellent aventurier !${prompt}
  11335: C’est un signe de temps troublés quand nous sommes aussi occupés. J’apprécie les gils supplémentaires, mais m’inquiéter pour ma peau n’en vaut pas la peine.${prompt}
  11336: Un forgeron n’est pas jugé par sa force, mais par son habileté dans son art !${prompt}
  11337: Voici le reliquaire, où notre défunt papsque, Muchavatte, est inhumé.${prompt}
  11338: Nous poursuivons ici notre discipline spirituelle, afin de pouvoir atteindre le Paradis comme Sa Sainteté avant nous.${prompt}
  11339: Contemple les bougies de chaque côté de l’épitaphe. Leurs flammes brûlent avec vigilance depuis le départ du Papsque Muchavatte.${prompt}

  11350: Merci pour ton service généreux.${prompt}
  11351: Ah, si ce n’est pas notre aventurier préféré ! Les invités étaient ravis, grâce à toi.${prompt}
  11352: En fait, nous avons encore besoin de ton aide… si tu as le temps, bien sûr.${prompt}
  11353: L’un de nos invités d’hier soir a attrapé froid. Nous aimerions aider, mais nous n’avons pas de médicament, vois-tu.${prompt}
  11354: Il y a une vieille femme nommée Amaura, une préparatrice de baumes et de remèdes, dans le sud de San d’Oria. Pourrais-tu aller en chercher un chez elle ?${prompt}
  11355: Bien sûr, il y a quelque chose pour toi aussi. Qu’en dis-tu ?${prompt}
  11356: Alors, tu as décidé de parler à Amaura pour nous ?${prompt}
  11357: Je vois… Je vais devoir chercher quelqu’un d’autre. Repasse si tu changes d’avis.${prompt}
  11358: Je savais que tu étais la personne à qui demander, comme toujours !${prompt}

  11362: Hrm… Mystères… Pourquoi cette partie est-elle différente de toutes les autres ?${prompt}

  11379: Voici l’Arche de la Victoire. Au-delà se trouve le sud de San d’Oria.${prompt}
  11380: Tu te tiens devant l’Arche de la Victoire. Le sud de San d’Oria est de l’autre côté.${prompt}
  11381: Cette porte mène au Port de San d’Oria.${prompt}
  11382: Voici la Porte Ranperre. Des monstres rôdent dans les terres au-delà, alors sois prudent !${prompt}
  11383: Bénis soient ceux qui chérissent Altana et écoutent la parole du papsque. À eux s’ouvriront les Portes du Paradis.${prompt}
  11384: Nous sommes ici pour voir le papsque s’adresser aux fidèles. Il se tient parfois au balcon de la cathédrale, sous le clocher.${prompt}
  11385: Hmm… Sa Sainteté devrait apparaître bientôt.${prompt}
  11386: Je le vois ! Le papsque !${prompt}
  11387: Oui, le voilà !${prompt}
  11388: Bien-aimée San d’Oria, Altana veille sur nous, toujours.${prompt}
  11389: Elle est l’alliée des faibles. Elle nourrit les affamés et vêt les nécessiteux.${prompt}
  11390: Elle nous a donné le chemin vers le Paradis éternel. Par cette épreuve, elle nous jugera tous.${prompt}
  11391: Que le Paradis ouvre ses portes à tous ses enfants !${prompt}

  11394: Tout le monde devrait chercher la bénédiction du papsque lui-même !${prompt}

  11396: Puis-je t’aider ?${prompt}

  11398: Bienvenue au Consulat de Jeuno.${prompt}
  11399: Bonjour. Je suis le consul de Bastok. Je m’appelle Helaku.${prompt}

  11401: Excuse-moi, mais nous sommes en pleine discussion très importante ici.${prompt}
  11402: Tu es ici pour des affaires administratives, n’est-ce pas ? Je crois que tu devrais parler au Consul Helaku.${prompt}
  11403: Tu es ici pour des affaires administratives, n’est-ce pas ? Tu devrais probablement parler au Consul Helaku.${prompt}
  11404: Bienvenue au Consulat de Bastok.${prompt}
  11405: Un San d’Orien, hein ? Voici le Consulat de Bastok. Nous sommes ici pour aider les voyageurs venant de Bastok.${prompt}
  11406: Un Windurstien, hein ? Voici le Consulat de Bastok. Le Consulat de Windurst est juste à l’extérieur.${prompt}
  11407: Consul Helaku ? Entre.${prompt}
  11408: 'Vraiment ? Tu ne dis pas… Merci.${wait-animation: 3}${prompt}'
  11409: Tu viens tout droit de Bastok, n’est-ce pas ? Je suis Lion, un aventurier itinérant, si tu veux.${prompt}
  11410: Tu viens tout droit de Windurst, n’est-ce pas ? Je suis Lion, un aventurier itinérant, si tu veux.${prompt}
  11411: As-tu entendu ? Les Orcs ont une nouvelle base avancée à Ghelsba, au nord-ouest. Maintenant, leurs yeux avides se tournent vers cette terre !${prompt}
  11412: Les Orcs sont cruels et violents. Ils attaquent les voyageurs sur la route et enlèvent des enfants, tout ça pour semer la terreur chez les San d’Oriens.${prompt}
  11413: Mais il y a une chose qui n’a tout simplement pas de sens.${prompt}
  11414: Les Orcs n’ont jamais été connus pour leur artisanat, mais dernièrement, ils portent des armures et des armes de meilleure qualité.${prompt}
  11415: Je soupçonne qu’il y a quelqu’un derrière les Orcs, qui tire les ficelles, si tu vois ce que je veux dire.${prompt}
  11416: Il faut que quelqu’un découvre leurs plans et agisse, avant que ce pays ne tombe sous une invasion orque !${prompt}
  11417: Les gens murmurent dans les rues à propos de troubles dans la maison royale. Ils devraient se concentrer sur ce qui se passe à l’extérieur de leurs murs d’abord, si tu veux mon avis.${prompt}
  11418: Eh bien, je ne m’attends pas à ce que les choses deviennent plus faciles ici de sitôt, mais prends soin de toi, quand même.${prompt}
  11419: Tu dois être fatigué de ton voyage. Mais d’abord, laisse-moi te mettre à jour sur la situation ici à San d’Oria.${prompt}
  11420: Au nord-ouest de la ville se trouve un village orque. Ils l’appellent le Poste avancé de Ghelsba.${prompt}
  11421: Nos rapports nous disent que les Orcs utilisent Ghelsba comme base avancée pour une invasion imminente de San d’Oria, mais il y a quelques éléments qui ne collent pas.${prompt}
  11422: Nous savons tous que les Orcs sont des hommes-bêtes, non ? Dire qu’ils sont faibles d’esprit serait un euphémisme.${prompt}
  11423: C’est pourquoi je me demande comment ils ont pu se procurer les armures et les armes de haute qualité qu’ils utilisent. Sans parler des armes à distance et des dispositifs !${prompt}
  11424: Nous soupçonnons qu’il y a quelqu’un derrière les hommes-bêtes qui donne les ordres, mais nous n’avons aucune idée de qui.${prompt}
  11425: J’aimerais pouvoir t’envoyer immédiatement à Ghelsba, mais dans cette région, les missions officielles nécessitent l’approbation de San d’Oria.${prompt}
  11426: Ce que je veux que tu fasses, c’est aller au Château d’Oraguille et parler à Monarlais Halver. Il te délivrera un ordre de mission officiel.${prompt}
  11427: Sors de ce bâtiment, et tu verras une grande forteresse à droite. C’est le Château d’Oraguille. Et sois poli ; les San d’Oriens peuvent être assez susceptibles.${prompt}
  11428: On dirait que Messire Halver t’a donné tes ordres. Bonne chance, et sois prudent là-bas.${prompt}
  11429: C’est bien de te voir en forme ! Messire Helaku sera ravi de te revoir.${prompt}
  11430: Bon retour ! Tu ne t’es pas blessé, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  11431: Monarlais Halver m’a dit que tu es allé défier le Chef de guerre Vatgit, hein ?${prompt}
  11432: Beaucoup d’aventuriers se rendent au Poste avancé de Ghelsba, mais la plupart font demi-tour une fois arrivés au campement supérieur.${prompt}
  11433: Eh bien, tu as fait un excellent travail. En tant que consul, j’ai l’honneur de te féliciter pour une mission bien accomplie.${prompt}
  11434: Je veillerai à ce que San d’Oria te certifie en tant qu’aventurier, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11435: Maintenant que cela est réglé, ton prochain objectif est Windurst ! C’est un monde sauvage là-bas, alors garde l’esprit vif.${prompt}
  11436: Qu’est-ce que c’est ? Tiens, reprends-le.${prompt}
  11437: 'Juste ce qu’il faut ! Je compte ${number: 0} ; ni plus, ni moins. Bon travail, ${name-player}.${prompt}'
  11438: 'Prochaine étape : Windurst, hein ? Bonne chance, et sois prudent là-bas !${prompt}'
  11439: Ah, ${name-player}, c’est bien toi ? J’ai entendu de bonnes choses à ton sujet de la part du Consul Melek à Windurst.${prompt}
  11440: San d’Oria est en guerre contre la horde orque. C’est dur pour les habitants de la ville. Ils ne peuvent même plus sortir sans craindre pour leur vie ces jours-ci.${prompt}
  11441: La maison royale essaie de réprimer les hommes-bêtes. Mais avec tant d’intrigues au sein de la famille royale, ils ne peuvent pas prendre de mesures décisives !${prompt}
  11442: Mais je ne devrais pas te retenir trop longtemps. Je ne connais pas moi-même les détails de ta mission spéciale.${prompt}
  11443: Tu dois te rendre au Château d’Oraguille et parler au monarlais de San d’Oria, Messire Halver. Il te dira tout ce que tu dois savoir.${prompt}
  11444: Tu l’as encore fait ! Tu me rends fier !${prompt}
  11445: 'Tu as été officiellement certifié par le Roi de San d’Oria. Maintenant, il ne te reste plus qu’à rentrer chez toi, récupérer ton ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, et tu seras un aventurier officiel.${prompt}'
  11446: Hâte-toi de retourner au pays et de voir Naji près du Bureau du Président. Il t’attendra.${prompt}
  11447: De plus, je te serais reconnaissant si tu pouvais rapporter ce rapport lorsque tu partiras. N’oublie pas de le lui remettre, maintenant.${prompt}
  11448: Tu ferais bien de retourner au pays. Naji se demande probablement où tu es à présent.${prompt}
  11449: Eh bien, si ce n’est pas ${name-player} ! Tu as l’air en forme ! Reste aussi longtemps que tu le souhaites. Tu mérites du repos, mon ami.${prompt}
  11450: Salutations ! Je suis le Consul Kasaroro, à ton service. Comment puis-je t’aider ?${prompt}
  11451: 'Je suis le Consul Kasaroro. Quoi ? Tu n’as pas ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} ? Tu devras en apporter un si tu as des affaires avec moi !${prompt}'
  11452: Bienvenue au Consulat de Windurst !${prompt}
  11453: Si c’est le consul que tu cherches, elle est à l’intérieur !${prompt}
  11454: Un San d’Orien, n’est-ce pas ? Voici le Consulat de Windurst. Nous apportons toutes sortes d’aides à nos compatriotes ici.${prompt}
  11455: Un Bastokien, n’est-ce pas ? Voici le Consulat de Windurst. Si tu cherches ton consulat, il est juste en face, à la porte.${prompt}
  11456: Bienvenue au Consulat de Windurst. Le Consul Kasaroro est à l’intérieur, si tu la cherches.${prompt}
  11457: Tu es venu sur ordre de la patrie, n’est-ce pas ? Tu devrais parler au Consul Kasaroro.${prompt}
  11458: Salutations, ${name-player} ! Je suis le Consul Kasaroro. Permets-moi de te parler des événements actuels ici dans le Royaume de San d’Oria.${prompt}
  11459: Des hommes-bêtes connus sous le nom d’Orques grandissent régulièrement en nombre aux alentours de San d’Oria.${prompt}
  11460: Ils ont établi une base avancée à Ghelsba, au nord-ouest de San d’Oria. De là, ils prévoient de lancer une invasion !${prompt}
  11461: Les Orques adorent le combat, mais ce ne sont pas les plus brillants. Il y a juste une chose…${prompt}
  11462: Il semble que leur armure et leurs armes s’améliorent jour après jour ! Maintenant, ils utilisent aussi des pièges et des arcs !${prompt}
  11463: Moi, et quelques autres, pensons qu’il y a quelqu’un derrière ces Orques, leur fournissant tout ce dont ils ont besoin, et tirant les ficelles. Mais pour l’instant, il n’y a pas assez d’informations.${prompt}
  11464: Si c’était à moi de décider, je t’enverrais immédiatement à Ghelsba ! Mais ici, à San d’Oria, les missions relèvent de leur juridiction.${prompt}
  11465: Alors, tu devrais d’abord parler à Monarlais Halver au Château d’Oraguille. Il te donnera les ordres officiels.${prompt}
  11466: Sors juste dehors, et tu verras un grand château à gauche. C’est le Château d’Oraguille. Ils sont un peu susceptibles là-bas, alors fais attention à tes manières !${prompt}
  11467: Alors, tu as reçu une offre de Monarlais Halver ? Excellent ! Prends soin de toi là-bas.${prompt}
  11468: Bon retour. J’espère que tu n’as pas été blessé ?${prompt}
  11469: J’ai entendu dire par le monarlais que tu es allé combattre le grand Chef de guerre Vatgit !${prompt}
  11470: Beaucoup d’aventuriers se rendent au Poste avancé de Ghelsba, mais la plupart rebroussent chemin au campement des hauteurs !${prompt}
  11471: Tu as fait un excellent travail ! J’ai l’honneur d’être ton consul.${prompt}
  11472: Je vais demander formellement à la cour de San d’Oria de te certifier, ${name-player}, en tant qu’aventurier officiel.${prompt}
  11473: Maintenant, il te suffit d’obtenir la reconnaissance de Bastok. Garde ton esprit vif, et tout ira bien !${prompt}
  11474: Ce n’est pas ce que j’avais demandé. Ramène-le, maintenant !${prompt}
  11475: 'Ah ! ${number: 0} ! Merci beaucoup. Ta mission ici est accomplie !${prompt}'
  11476: Maintenant, tu dois juste accomplir une mission pour Bastok ! C’est un monde dangereux là-bas, alors sois prudent !${prompt}
  11477: Eh bien, c’est ${name-player} ! J’ai entendu parler de ton succès par le Consul Patt-Pott à Bastok. On dirait que tu as fait du bon travail !${prompt}
  11478: Ce Patt-Pott parle sans arrêt, alors c’était difficile de comprendre ce qu’il disait au début…${prompt}
  11479: Mais ce n’est ni ici ni là-bas ! La guerre continue ici à San d’Oria, et les civils essaient de faire face.${prompt}

  11482: Tu devras te rendre au Château d’Oraguille et demander à Monarlais Halver. Il t’expliquera tout !${prompt}

  11496: Hmm… Je n’ai aucune idée de quoi vous parlez.${prompt}
  11497: Un pickpocket ? Non, je ne peux pas dire que j’ai vu quelqu’un comme ça. Je garderai l’œil ouvert, cependant.${prompt}
  11498: Un pickpocket ? J’ai des problèmes plus importants à régler ! Demandez à quelqu’un d’autre.${prompt}
  11499: Un pickpocket, dites-vous ? Hmm… À bien y réfléchir, j’ai aperçu une femme étrange courir sur le pont là-bas il y a un moment.${prompt}
  11500: Elle a couru vers cette porte, ce qui signifie qu’elle pourrait être aux Terrains de Parade maintenant.${prompt}
  11501: Un pickpocket ? Hé, je me demande si vous parlez de cette femme qui courait à toute allure par là tout à l’heure…${prompt}
  11502: Un pickpocket ? J’ai bien vu une femme peu distinguée tout à l’heure. Elle courait vers la Porte Ranperre.${prompt}
  11503: Cette partie de la ville est si animée, j’aime regarder tout le monde vaquer à ses occupations.${prompt}
  11504: Un pickpocket ?${prompt}
  11505: Eh bien, j’ai vu une étrangère. Elle a couru vers la porte là-bas tout à l’heure.${prompt}
  11506: Un pickpocket ? Peut-être était-ce cette femme grossière tout à l’heure. Elle m’a traité de « barde ridicule » ! Impensable !${prompt}
  11507: Bonjour. Je suis Ulycille. Vous intéressez-vous au travail du bois ?${prompt}
  11508: Les artisans du bois de San d’Oria sont bénis par une abondance de matières premières, car notre royaume est entouré de collines boisées.${prompt}
  11509: 'Si vous cherchez à perfectionner vos compétences en travail du bois, écoutez ce conseil : San d’Oria est l’endroit idéal pour commencer !${prompt}'
  11510: Un aventurier, n’est-ce pas ? Voici l’un des meilleurs ateliers du pays. Bien sûr, beaucoup dépend de vous.${prompt}
  11511: Si vous souhaitez affiner vos compétences, fabriquez la même chose encore et encore. Travaillez dur, et vous pourriez devenir connu parmi nous.${prompt}
  11512: Dites, avez-vous entendu ?${prompt}
  11513: À propos des princes ? Qui n’a pas entendu ? Les choses empirent, à ce qu’on dit !${prompt}
  11514: Oui, mais je fais plus confiance au Prince Trion qu’au Prince Pieuje. Il est l’aîné, et le plus fort des deux.${prompt}
  11515: Oh, il est tout en muscles et sans cervelle, incapable de décider du sort de notre royaume. Moi, je suivrais le Prince Pieuje, personnellement.${prompt}
  11516: Est-ce moi, ou y a-t-il plus d’étrangers en ville ces jours-ci ? Que cela peut-il bien signifier ?${prompt}
  11517: Quoi, vous n’êtes pas au courant ? Ils recrutent des aventuriers en masse !${prompt}
  11518: J’ai entendu dire qu’ils prennent tous ceux qui veulent venir – même des étrangers !${prompt}
  11519: Eh bien, devinez ce qui m’est arrivé. Je rangeais la maison hier, quand un homme étrange est entré. Il a ensuite couru sur la véranda sans même dire bonjour !${prompt}
  11520: Honte à ces aventuriers ! Ils pourraient au moins frapper avant d’entrer dans nos maisons.${prompt}
  11521: Êtes-vous une nouvelle recrue ? Bonjour, je suis Matildie.${prompt}
  11522: Vous semblez gentil – bien plus gentil que les autres aventuriers. Souvenez-vous, demandez de l’aide si vous vous perdez !${prompt}
  11523: 'Pourquoi ne pas vous donner un peu d’argent pour votre ${item-singular: 0[2]} là, juste pour vous aider à démarrer. Dépensez-le sagement !${prompt}'
  11524: Si vous vous perdez, vérifiez simplement votre « Carte » dans le menu principal.${prompt}
  11525: Adieu, et bonne chance à vous !${prompt}
  11526: Au revoir !${prompt}
  11527: 'Ces vannes divisent le nord de San d’Oria en deux parties : les Terrains de Parade et le Chemin des Travailleurs.${prompt}'
  11528: Le Chemin des Travailleurs est bien plus bas que le reste de la ville. Alors, pour éviter les inondations, nous utilisons ces vannes pour ajuster l’eau pour tout le quartier !${prompt}
  11529: Attendez, vous êtes un aventurier, n’est-ce pas ? J’ai une requête, si vous avez le temps…${prompt}
  11530: Ne le dites à personne, mais quelqu’un m’a envoyé une lettre disant qu’ils ont empoisonné l’eau ici ! Nous enquêtons sur la véracité de cette affirmation maintenant.${prompt}
  11531: En attendant, nous devons préparer un neutralisant pour éliminer le poison. Seriez-vous prêt à en obtenir un ?${prompt}

  11534: Oh, nous ne pouvons pas laisser des innocents mourir d’une eau empoisonnée, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  11535: Ce n’est pas une tâche facile, trouver un neutralisant, n’est-ce pas ? Peu de gens sont compétents dans l’art des poisons, bien que ce soit une bonne chose, je suppose.${prompt}
  11536: Tu as le neutralisant ! Mais, en fait… il s’avère que c’était juste une fausse alerte. Nous allons te récompenser quand même.${prompt}
  11537: C’est drôle. J’aurais juré qu’elle m’avait demandé de la rencontrer ici…${prompt}
  11538: Il est en retard ! J’espère qu’il n’a pas oublié.${prompt}
  11539: Les étoiles sont plus belles de près. Ne trouves-tu pas ?${prompt}

  11629: Ils sont comme six serpents en cercle, chacun mordant la queue de celui qui le précède.${prompt}
  11630: Je vais t’expliquer simplement. L’eau éteint le feu, tandis que la chaleur du feu fait fondre la glace.${prompt}
  11631: La glace bloque le vent, tandis que le vent érode la terre. Peux-tu le voir juste là ?${prompt}
  11632: La terre vole l’énergie de la foudre, tandis que la foudre lance ses éclairs dans l’eau.${prompt}

  11745: Toutes les trois nations luttent chaque jour pour mettre plus de régions sous leur contrôle. C'est ce que nous appelons les « conquêtes ». Vous pouvez y participer et servir votre pays en combattant des ennemis tant que le Sceau est jeté sur vous.${prompt}
  11746: Chaque région comprend plusieurs zones, et la nation qui débarrasse ces zones du plus grand nombre de monstres prend le contrôle de la région.${prompt}
  11747: Les nations reçoivent des biens et des ressources des régions sous leur contrôle.${prompt}
  11748: Ainsi, plus de régions nous contrôlons, plus notre nation devient riche.${prompt}

    Des gardes-frontières sont également placés dans les avant-postes des régions sous notre contrôle.

  11750: Une fois que vous avez le Sceau de votre nation, vous pourrez acquérir des cristaux des ennemis que vous défaites.${prompt}
  11751: Non seulement cela, mais vous recevrez aussi des points de conquête. Vous gagnez plus de points de conquête si vous vainquez des ennemis dans des régions qui ne sont pas sous le contrôle de votre nation. Ces points peuvent être utilisés pour acheter des objets auprès des gardes comme moi.${prompt}
  11752: |-
    Comme vous le voyez... les conquêtes profitent aux nations et aux aventuriers.
    Nous attendons de vous que vous fassiez de votre mieux pour servir votre pays.${prompt}

  11761: Tu peux acheter des objets auprès de gardes comme moi avec tes points de conquête, mais attention, le nombre de points que tu dépenses sera déduit de ton total actuel.${prompt}
  11762: Lorsque les résultats de la conquête seront annoncés, on te dira quel pays contrôle la région où tu te trouves à ce moment-là. Parfois, des régions peuvent devenir neutres, ou même les hommes-bêtes peuvent en prendre le contrôle.${prompt}
  11763: Si nous prenons le contrôle d’une région, des gardes-frontières seront placés à ses avant-postes pour aider les aventuriers comme toi.${prompt}
  11764: Des marchands seront également installés là-bas, et les produits de cette région arriveront dans les boutiques locales ici.${prompt}
  11765: Prendre le contrôle des régions est le principe de base des conquêtes. Nous avons besoin que chacun de vous fasse de son mieux pour hisser notre nation au sommet du classement.${prompt}
  11766: Bien sûr, parfois nous perdons des régions au profit d’autres nations… alors nous devons essayer de les reprendre avant l’annonce des prochains résultats de la conquête.${prompt}
  11767: Pour t’encourager, nous t’accorderons plus de points de conquête pour avoir vaincu des monstres dans ces régions.${prompt}
  11768: Mais si nous sommes alliés avec une autre nation, tu recevras le taux habituel pour vaincre des monstres dans les régions de nos alliés. En revanche, nous t’accorderons plus de points pour combattre dans les régions de la nation la mieux classée.${prompt}
  11769: |-
    Notre principale préoccupation est que les hommes-bêtes prennent le contrôle de nos régions.
    Si trop d’entre nous sont vaincus dans une région, les hommes-bêtes en prendront le contrôle.${prompt}
  11770: Si cela arrive, non seulement c’est un coup dur pour notre fierté, mais tu ne pourras plus obtenir de cristaux dans cette région.${prompt}
  11771: Les hommes-bêtes sont une menace pour toutes les nations. S’ils gagnent en puissance, nous devons tous nous unir et chasser ces viles créatures de cette région.${prompt}
  11772: Nous avons besoin que tu apportes des provisions aux gardes-frontières des avant-postes situés dans les régions sous notre contrôle.${prompt}
  11773: Il y a un avant-poste dans chaque région. Sélectionne « Infos Région » dans le menu et cherche les zones avec une petite marque de drapeau sur la carte. C’est là qu’ils se trouvent.${prompt}

  12421: Tu es revenu après avoir combattu des Orcs, n’est-ce pas ? S’il te plaît, raconte-moi tes aventures !${prompt}
  12422: Je suis désolé, Ailbeche. D’abord, je dois me reposer, car je suis épuisé. Et qui est-ce ? On dirait un chevalier, comme moi.${prompt}
  12423: Oui. ${choice-player-gender}[Il/Elle] a fait de grands efforts pour m’aider pendant que tu étais absent.${prompt}
  12424: Vraiment ?${prompt}
  12425: Toutes mes excuses ! Je suis Vilbert, remplaçant du Capitaine Exoroche des Chevaliers Royaux. Permets-moi de te remercier d’avoir veillé sur Ailbeche.${prompt}
  12426: Vilbert est dans la même division que mon père.${prompt}
  12427: Depuis que le Capitaine Exoroche est tombé malade, on m’a donné le commandement temporaire de sa division.${prompt}
  12428: Étrange, ça… Mon père va bien.${prompt}
  12429: En tout cas, Vilbert est un grand épéiste. Il a remporté la deuxième place au dernier tournoi !${prompt}
  12430: Eh bien, j’attribue cela à la chance, rien de plus.${prompt}
  12431: Hé !${prompt}
  12432: Salutations, Zarnei-Hamnei. Qu’y a-t-il ?${prompt}

  12434: Vraiment ? J’ai supplié mille fois, mais la réponse a toujours été non.${prompt}
  12435: Oui, bien sûr. À une condition…${prompt}

  12437: 'Oui. Tu dois apporter ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12438: 'Quoi ? Tu demandes l’impossible ! Comment un enfant comme moi est censé attraper ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} ?${prompt}'

  12441: Bon, à plus tard ! Tu ferais mieux de l’avoir quand je reviendrai, sinon je ne t’emmènerai pas !${prompt}
  12442: Est-ce que le gros poisson est vraiment si gros ?${prompt}
  12443: Bien sûr ! On dit qu’il avale souvent des morceaux de trésor. On ne s’arrêtera pas tant qu’il ne sera pas à nous !${prompt}
  12444: Mais il y a un secret là-dedans. On ne dira jamais où il mord, de peur que d’autres ne l’attrapent avant nous !${prompt}

  12454: Oh, comme j’aimerais que Père soit plus comme Vilbert. Il n’en donnerait pas un, même si je le lui demandais.${prompt}
  12455: Oh, je savais qu’il dirait non. Il y a longtemps, Père n’était pas comme ça.${prompt}
  12456: Tu vois, ma mère a été tuée par des Orcs. Mon père était là, mais il n’a pas pu la sauver.${prompt}
  12457: Il a blâmé sa mort sur la qualité de son armure et de ses armes. Il a abandonné l’entraînement à l’épée tous les matins et passe tout son temps à fouiller les boutiques pour trouver de l’équipement.${prompt}
  12458: Il est requis pour les expéditions, mais il décline toujours, prétextant une maladie ou un manque d’équipement. J’ai peur qu’il perde son rang de capitaine.${prompt}

  12467: C’est toujours comme ça.${prompt}
  12468: Je n’y arriverai jamais, alors laisse-moi te dire où tu peux pêcher le gros poisson. On dit qu’il est au Château d’Oztroja.${prompt}
  12469: 'Si tu emmènes un pêcheur renommé avec toi, tu devrais lui offrir quelque chose. Au minimum, tu devrais donner environ cinq ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12470: Mais si tu veux pêcher toi-même, tu devrais y arriver facilement, à condition d’avoir un peu d’entraînement. Après tout, la pêche, c’est une question de patience !${prompt}
  12471: Si tu attrapes le gros poisson, fais attention ! On dit que c’est un poisson sacrément combatif. Tes compétences à l’épée te seront plus utiles que celles de la pêche, je suppose.${prompt}
  12472: J’ai découvert tout ça, et pourtant je ne peux pas y aller moi-même. S’il te plaît, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame], attrape-le à ma place !${prompt}
  12473: On dit que tu peux attraper le gros poisson au Château d’Oztroja. Ce serait dommage si quelqu’un l’attrapait avant toi !${prompt}
  12474: Quoi ? Tu as attrapé le gros poisson ? Incroyable ! Je doute que j’aurais pu faire de même.${prompt}
  12475: Maintenant, dépêche-toi de le faire nettoyer ! J’ai entendu parler d’un pêcheur expert à Selbina. Tu devrais le trouver et lui demander !${prompt}
  12476: Wow ! Une telle chose était dans son gésier ? Sûrement que je n’aurais jamais pu l’attraper, car il t’a donné du fil à retordre, même à toi.${prompt}
  12477: Père, comment as-tu pu oublier cette épée ?${prompt}
  12478: Quoi ? Vilbert est de mèche avec les Orcs ? Ha ! Quelle absurdité !${prompt}
  12479: Je ne me laisserai pas avoir par une telle blague si facilement. Vilbert m’emmène pêcher dans la Forêt de Jugner. Ne sois pas surpris si j’attrape un poisson plus gros que le gros poisson !${prompt}
  12480: Tu as vu, n’est-ce pas ? Mon père est un puissant chevalier ! J’aimerais devenir comme lui !${prompt}
  12481: Père a promis de m’emmener pêcher ! Mais je sais qu’il est bien meilleur épéiste que pêcheur.${prompt}
  12482: 'Maintenant, je vais préparer le ${item-singular: 0[2]} que tu m’as donné.${prompt}'
  12483: Admire la beauté de cette cathédrale. Nous avons échoué à la protéger une fois, mais plus jamais.${prompt}
  12484: Narcheral, j’apporte des nouvelles !${prompt}
  12485: Quoi !? Es-tu certain ?${prompt}
  12486: Oui.${prompt}
  12487: Ils se rassemblent par centaines !? I-Impossible !${prompt}
  12488: Quoi qu’il en soit, tu dois retourner là-bas et continuer l’enquête.${prompt}
  12489: Aventurier, j’ai une requête. Pars immédiatement pour les frontières ouest des Dunes de Valkurm. Trouve le messager des traqueurs sombres là-bas, mais uniquement la nuit.${prompt}
  12490: 'Vaincs le traqueur sombre et prends son ${item-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}'

  12492: 'Oui, c’est bien ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}. Notre pire cauchemar s’est réalisé.${prompt}'
  12493: Ceci est pour toi. Je pressens que j’aurai encore besoin de ton aide…${prompt}
  12494: Excellent travail, mon ami. Voici ce que j’ai promis. Nous ne pouvons qu’attendre la décision du Prince Pieuje maintenant.${prompt}
  12495: Eh bien, j’ai entendu qu’un aventurier a terrassé le Marquis Altedour, mais penser que c’était toi !${prompt}
  12496: Le Prince Pieuje me déçoit par son inaction. J’aurais suggéré qu’il s’attribue le mérite de la défaite du marquis.${prompt}
  12497: Je voyais en lui un esprit plus lumineux. Je suppose que la royauté ne saura jamais à quel point une position dans la société peut être sécurisée.${prompt}
  12498: Oh, ignore mes réflexions. Tu nous as rendu un grand service, et pour cela, tu mérites une récompense.${prompt}
  12499: Dis, es-tu un aventurier ?${prompt}
  12500: Je m’appelle Rochefogne, et je suis aussi un aventurier. Je viens d’arriver à San d’Oria…${prompt}
  12501: Et déjà, je suis frappé par le peu de choses qui ont changé ! Le temps n’a pas de pouvoir sur cette ville.${prompt}
  12502: Peux-tu voir la grande cathédrale là-bas ? Les fidèles San d’Oriens s’y rassemblent encore pour vénérer la Déesse de l’Aube.${prompt}
  12503: Et regarde son balcon ! Le papsque se tient-il encore là pour accorder des bénédictions ?${prompt}
  12504: Hmm ? Et ce doivent être des Chevaliers Royaux…${prompt}
  12505: Ils retournent rapidement au Château d’Oraguille, sûrement après une expédition à l’étranger…${prompt}
  12506: Toi aussi, tu dois apprendre la différence entre les Chevaliers du Temple et les Chevaliers Royaux, si tu veux porter la citoyenneté San d’Orienne !${prompt}
  12507: Les Chevaliers du Temple protègent la capitale, tandis que les Chevaliers Royaux frappent nos ennemis !${prompt}
  12508: J’ai entendu dire lors de mes voyages que le Prince Trion avait pris le contrôle des Chevaliers Royaux.${prompt}
  12509: Oui, Trion… Cela fait des lustres que je n’ai rien entendu de lui. J’espère que les princes vont bien.${prompt}
  12510: Et la Princesse Claidie ! On dit qu’elle est la belle jeune sœur de Trion et Pieuje. Peut-être qu’un jour je la rencontrerai !${prompt}
  12511: Mais je m’égare. Toutes mes excuses !${prompt}
  12512: Cela fait si longtemps que je suis parti que mes pensées s’emballent. S’il te plaît, fais-moi part de tes questions.${prompt}
  12513: |-
    Que veux-tu demander ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Rien de particulier.
    Je veux sortir et me battre.
    Je veux faire des achats.
    Je veux en savoir plus sur l’aventure.${prompt}
  12514: Si tu souhaites quitter la ville depuis ici, dans le Nord de San d’Oria, tu dois passer par la Porte de Ranperre à l’ouest.${prompt}
  12515: Tu as sûrement une carte de cette ville, mais écoute quand même mes indications.${prompt}
  12516: D’abord, marche vers l’ouest depuis la Place d’Armes où nous nous trouvons actuellement.${prompt}
  12517: Passe par la porte, et suis la route après le magasin de meubles et l’auberge.${prompt}
  12518: Prends la porte à ta gauche, puis tourne encore à gauche en descendant les escaliers. Bientôt, la Porte de Ranperre se dressera devant toi.${prompt}
  12519: Faire des achats ? Eh bien, aux maisons de vente aux enchères et au bazar, tu trouveras des biens d’autres aventuriers. Mais laisse-moi te parler des boutiques que je fréquente.${prompt}
  12520: Pour les armes, renseigne-toi à l’armurerie dans le coin nord-ouest du Nord de San d’Oria. Sur ta carte, il y a un symbole d’épée. C’est l’endroit.${prompt}
  12521: Pour les armures, marche vers le sud jusqu’au Sud de San d’Oria. Vérifie ta carte pour trouver la boutique marquée d’une cotte de mailles.${prompt}
  12522: Si tu cherches de la magie, va au nord-ouest. Près de la Guilde des Charpentiers, il y a une porte qui mène au Port de San d’Oria. Cherche un parchemin sur ta carte pour trouver la boutique de magie.${prompt}
  12523: Pour de l’argent, les habitants de la ville peuvent te donner une récompense pour les aider. Tu peux aussi chasser des monstres et vendre le butin aux marchands en ville.${prompt}
  12524: On dirait un vrai aventurier ! Que veux-tu savoir ?${prompt}
  12525: |-
    Que veux-tu savoir ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Aider les gens.
    Chasser des monstres.
    Gagner de l’argent facilement.
    Trouver du travail.${prompt}
  12526: Aider les gens, hein ? En y réfléchissant, j’ai vu une dame faire les cent pas devant une maison dans le Sud de San d’Oria.${prompt}
  12527: Peut-être que tu pourrais l’aider. Elle devrait encore être là, sur le Chemin des Piquiers.${prompt}
  12528: Traverse l’Arche de la Victoire derrière toi pour entrer dans le Sud de San d’Oria. Ensuite, ouvre ta carte et trouve le chemin.${prompt}
  12529: Tu sembles sûr de toi. Je suis très soulagé.${prompt}
  12530: En y réfléchissant, un marchand à l’extérieur de la Guilde des Tanneurs dans le Sud de San d’Oria m’a demandé de rassembler des peaux.${prompt}
  12531: Peut-être que tu pourrais le faire à ma place ? Traverse l’Arche de la Victoire derrière toi pour entrer dans le Sud de San d’Oria. Ensuite, dirige-toi vers l’ouest pour atteindre la Guilde des Tanneurs.${prompt}
  12532: Les nouvelles armes et armures peuvent coûter une fortune.${prompt}
  12533: Mais, hmm… Ah, oui. Je te recommande de voir les menuisiers sur le Chemin des Travailleurs. Ils pourraient avoir quelque chose pour toi.${prompt}
  12534: Le Chemin des Travailleurs se trouve au nord-ouest de nous. Passe devant le magasin de meubles et l’auberge, et prends la porte à droite. Le Chemin des Travailleurs s’ouvre juste en dessous.${prompt}
  12535: Pour faire briller la gloire de San d’Oria, tu devrais entreprendre les missions données par les postes de garde.${prompt}
  12536: Elles ne sont pas rémunérées, mais tu peux gagner des points de rang comme preuve de tes contributions à notre royaume.${prompt}
  12537: Avec assez de points de rang, ton rang augmentera.${prompt}
  12538: Et avec un rang plus élevé viennent de plus grandes opportunités. Ceux de haut rang se voient confier des tâches qui décident du destin du Royaume !${prompt}
  12539: 'Maintenant, tu ferais mieux de te mettre en route. Aventure-toi fièrement pour San d’Oria, et ton ${choice: 6}[épée/épée/poings/bâton/bâton/épée/lame] ne faiblira jamais !${prompt}'
  12540: 'As-tu compris ? Aventure-toi fièrement pour San d’Oria, et ton ${choice: 6}[épée/épée/poings/bâton/bâton/épée/lame] ne faiblira jamais !${prompt}'

  12542: Oh, avant que j’oublie… Je te donne ceci pour tes voyages. Montre-le à Matildie, qui se tient devant le pont-levis du Château d’Oraguille.${prompt}
  12543: Cependant, connais-tu notre tradition concernant la transmission d’objets ? Avant de donner à d’autres, nous ouvrons le menu principal et sélectionnons « Échanger ».${prompt}
  12544: N’hésite pas à demander de l’aide à d’autres aventuriers.${prompt}
  12545: Maintenant, je dois aller chercher une entrée pour le château. Puissions-nous nous revoir, ${name-player} !${prompt}
  12546: Oh, un aventurier. Si tu es ici pour le sermon sur les Portes du Paradis, adresse-toi au frère qui se tient au narthex.${prompt}
  12547: Tu dis que tu viens de la part des Chevaliers du Temple ? Et tu veux des informations sur Tedimout ?${prompt}
  12548: Eh bien, qu’Altana te bénisse ! Oui, Tedimout était un frère en formation.${prompt}
  12549: Il se rendait souvent dans les bois de Ronfaure, à la recherche d’herbes sauvages pour préparer du thé et des remèdes.${prompt}
  12550: Je l’ai toujours mis en garde contre le fait d’y aller seul, car les arbres peuvent cacher des prédateurs… et pire encore !${prompt}
  12551: Il prétendait que les robes bleues du clergé le protégeraient.${prompt}
  12552: Mais il semble que sa foi ait été mal placée. J’ai peur que les Orcs l’aient capturé !${prompt}
  12553: L’horreur qu’il doit affronter maintenant… Chaque matin et chaque soir, je prie la Déesse de l’Aube pour qu’elle le délivre de leurs griffes !${prompt}
  12554: Tiens, le Prince Pieuje ! Et le Papsque Shamonde !${prompt}
  12555: Vicasque Arnau, je suis venu vous parler de l’acolyte porté disparu. Il semble que sa disparition ne soit pas l’œuvre des Orcs, après tout.${prompt}
  12556: C’est exact, Votre Altesse. J’ai entendu dire que Tedimout allait parfois dans la forêt pour chercher des herbes.${prompt}
  12557: Ne tirons pas de conclusions hâtives. Peut-être que Tedimout est parti de son propre chef… pour une longue randonnée, par exemple ! Les Chevaliers du Temple ne sont envoyés que dans des cas spéciaux. Nous devons d’abord en savoir plus !${prompt}
  12558: Vous dites vrai, Votre Sainteté. La citadelle ne peut pas être vidée de ses Chevaliers du Temple pour une cause aussi incertaine.${prompt}
  12559: Je comprends, bien sûr. Cependant… S’il était vrai que Tedimout ait été enlevé par des Orcs, nous ne pourrions surely pas le laisser mourir, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  12560: Non, bien sûr que non. J’ai décidé d’envoyer un aventurier. Si ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] découvre que les Orcs retiennent le garçon, alors les Chevaliers du Temple seront là pour le récupérer.${prompt}
  12561: Je comprends, Votre Altesse. Je vous suis très reconnaissant.${prompt}
  12562: Au fait, avec qui parlais-tu ?${prompt}
  12563: Votre Altesse, ${name-player} est ici pour une mission du chevalier au poste de garde. ${choice-player-gender}[Il/Elle] est venu poser des questions sur Tedimout.${prompt}
  12564: Eh bien, c’est parfait. Je vais t’ordonner d’entreprendre cette mission.${prompt}
  12565: Infiltre Ghelsba et détermine s’ils retiennent Tedimout en captivité. J’ai entendu dire qu’ils gardent les prisonniers dans une petite cabane quelque part.${prompt}
  12566: Une fois que tu sauras, informe un Chevalier du Temple. Maintenant, va !${prompt}
  12567: Tu as mes éternels remerciements pour avoir sauvé Tedimout !${prompt}
  12568: Merci, ${name-player} !${prompt}
  12569: Tout ce que je peux faire, c’est prier pour les aventuriers. S’il te plaît, laisse-moi prier pour toi aussi.${prompt}
  12570: Que la lumière éclaire ton chemin, et que les Portes du Paradis s’ouvrent à toi !${prompt}
  12571: Alors, Tedimout est revenu… Maudits soient ces aventuriers qui se mêlent de tout !${prompt}
  12572: Nous pouvons négocier avec les Orcs une fois que nous saurons ce qu’ils veulent, mais je déteste l’idée d’envoyer des Chevaliers du Temple en reconnaissance.${prompt}
  12573: Ce frère impulsif que vous avez refuse de penser de manière pragmatique. Nos recherches à travers les siècles prouvent que les Portes du Paradis s’ouvriront bientôt !${prompt}
  12574: Et pourtant, il reste sourd à nos paroles ! Votre Altesse, j’ai peur que nous ne prenions du retard sur les autres nations.${prompt}
  12575: Je comprends. Nous devons d’abord découvrir ce que les Orcs savent des portes du Paradis.${prompt}
  12576: Ils sont devenus audacieux récemment. Certains disent que leur influence s’étend jusqu’à la Tombe du Roi Ranperre et les Grottes d’Ordelle.${prompt}
  12577: Hm ? Y a-t-il quelqu’un là-bas ?${prompt}
  12578: Comment oses-tu ! Écouter aux portes alors que le papsque reçoit le prince !${prompt}
  12579: Non, ce n’est pas grave, Votre Sainteté.${prompt}
  12580: Tu es venu livrer le rapport, oui ? Eh bien, voyons cela.${prompt}
  12581: Donc… Les Orcs cherchent quelque chose. Nous ne pouvons pas dire quoi. Cela nécessite une enquête plus approfondie.${prompt}
  12582: Hmph.${prompt}
  12583: Merci, ${name-player}. Je vais informer le chevalier du poste de garde que ta mission est terminée.${prompt}
  12584: Oh, te voilà de retour. Eh bien, si tu es si heureux d’avoir vaincu un ou deux Orcs, tu as encore un long chemin devant toi !${prompt}
  12585: Pour quelqu’un d’aussi novice, je serais… Hmm ?${prompt}
  12586: Seigneur chevalier, pardonnez cette interruption, mais il y a quelque chose que je dois vous demander.${prompt}
  12587: Je me demande si la Reine Leaute est vraiment morte il y a quinze ans. Dites-moi, de quoi est-elle morte ?${prompt}
  12588: Qui es-tu, et pourquoi poses-tu de telles questions indiscrètes ?${prompt}
  12589: S’il vous plaît, j’ai voyagé de loin pour voir Son Altesse !${prompt}
  12590: Tu as fait quoi !?${prompt}
  12591: Très bien. Écoute attentivement. Il y a quinze ans, la Reine Leaute a succombé à une maladie rare. Elle a quitté ce monde avant que nous puissions la sauver.${prompt}
  12592: Ah, donc une maladie a pris sa vie.${prompt}
  12593: Eh bien, ça ne te concerne pas, de toute façon. Même si elle était en vie, un aventurier comme toi ne pourrait jamais la voir, encore moins l’intérieur du Château d’Oraguille.${prompt}
  12594: Euh…${prompt}
  12595: Quel était le nom de sa maladie ?${prompt}
  12596: On ne nous dit pas ce genre de choses. Seule la famille royale le saurait.${prompt}

  12598: Hé, attends !${prompt}
  12599: Qu’est-ce qui n’allait pas avec cet aventurier ? Il était sacrément têtu, non ?${prompt}
  12600: On aurait dit qu’il connaissait personnellement la défunte reine, mais comment pouvait-il ignorer sa mort ?${prompt}
  12601: Quoi qu’il en soit, ton travail est terminé. Excellent travail, mon ami !${prompt}
  12602: Quoi, tu veux refaire la mission de rang un ?${prompt}
  12603: 'Je savais que tu reviendrais sain et sauf, et avec le ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Mission terminée !${prompt}'
  12604: As-tu déjà mis les pieds dans la Tombe du Roi Ranperre ?${prompt}
  12605: Il y a deux cents ans, l’âge d’or de San d’Oria a pris fin. Une guerre civile a éclaté pour l’hégémonie du Royaume.${prompt}
  12606: Le Roi Ranperre était là pour éteindre le conflit. À sa mort, il fut inhumé dans une grande tombe au sud d’Est Ronfaure.${prompt}
  12607: Mais des mains inconnues ont profané sa tombe récemment.${prompt}
  12608: Les visiteurs rapportent des pierres tombales manquantes et des ombres qui se tordent dans les cavernes. Profaner une tombe royale est un crime impardonnable !${prompt}
  12609: Tes ordres sont d’enquêter sur la tombe et de déterminer s’il y a du vrai dans ce qu’ils disent. As-tu compris ?${prompt}
  12610: |-
    Acceptes-tu la mission ?
    ${selection-lines}
    J’accepte.
    Je n’accepte pas.${prompt}
  12611: Je t’implore de te hâter vers la Tombe du Roi Ranperre. Tu pourrais y trouver des preuves de pilleurs de tombes.${prompt}
  12612: Mais si tu t’aventures trop profondément à l’intérieur, des Gobelins pourraient te trouver. Marche avec audace, mon ami, mais ne te mets pas en danger !${prompt}
  12613: Les visiteurs rapportent des pierres tombales manquantes et des ombres qui se tordent dans les cavernes. Explore la tombe et détermine s’ils disent la vérité.${prompt}
  12614: Hâte-toi vers la Tombe du Roi Ranperre. Tu pourrais y trouver des preuves de pilleurs de tombes.${prompt}
  12615: As-tu vraiment fouillé la tombe ?${prompt}
  12616: Alors, tu as obtenu ceci des chauves-souris dans la Tombe du Roi Ranperre ?${prompt}
  12617: Tu vois, ceci appartenait en réalité à un Orc. Que pourraient vouloir les Orcs dans la tombe ?${prompt}
  12618: Quoi qu’il en soit, ta mission est terminée. Ne dis pas un mot de ceci à quiconque.${prompt}
  12619: Ah, la recrue est de retour ? Je suis désolé, mais je n’ai pas de temps pour toi aujourd’hui.${prompt}
  12620: Je sais que tu as fait tout ce chemin, mais je ne peux pas t’aider pour le moment.${prompt}
  12621: Oh, à qui est-ce que je veux faire croire ça ? Bien sûr que j’ai besoin de ton aide !${prompt}
  12622: N’as-tu pas entendu ? Des Orcs sont venus et ont enlevé des enfants ! Nous pensons qu’ils les retiennent dans leur repaire à Ghelsba.${prompt}
  12623: Eh bien, il n’y a pas longtemps, de mauvaises nouvelles sont arrivées de la cathédrale. Un garçon en formation pour devenir frère s’est approché de Ghelsba et n’est pas revenu. Il s’appelait Tedimout.${prompt}
  12624: Les Chevaliers Royaux marcheraient à son secours, mais le Prince Trion est absent dans le nord et ne peut pas donner l’ordre.${prompt}
  12625: Le Prince Pieuje est en pleines délibérations sur l’envoi des Chevaliers du Temple à la place. Il semble que ses efforts se concentrent sur le sauvetage des enfants, mais…${prompt}
  12626: Mais peu importe. Nous avons besoin d’informations sur l’ennemi. Tu dois te rendre à la cathédrale et demander à quoi ressemble ce garçon.${prompt}
  12627: Un garçon en formation pour devenir frère s’est approché de Ghelsba et n’est pas revenu. Il s’appelait Tedimout.${prompt}
  12628: Les Chevaliers du Temple pourraient être mobilisés bientôt. Tu dois te rendre à la cathédrale et demander à quoi ressemble ce garçon.${prompt}
  12629: Le Prince Trion vient de m’informer de ton travail. Tu as fait un travail magnifique.${prompt}
  12630: Grâce à ta contribution exemplaire, ${name-player}, San d’Oria te reconnaît désormais comme un aventurier de rang deux.${prompt}
  12631: Mais ne te laisse pas emporter. Ce certificat n’est valable qu’à San d’Oria.${prompt}
  12632: Travaille dur et de meilleures choses viendront, mon ami. Un jour, ton nom sera connu de nos alliés également.${prompt}
  12633: Oh, et une dernière chose. Le vicasque de la cathédrale a dit qu’il voulait te remercier au nom du garçon.${prompt}
  12634: Tu atteins le rang deux.${prompt}
  12635: Quoi qu’il en soit, tu as bien accompli la mission. Il est temps pour une récompense !${prompt}
  12636: Je t’accorde des points de rang proportionnels à ton exploit.${prompt}
  12637: Le Prince Trion a ordonné aux éclaireurs des Chevaliers Royaux de se rendre à Davoi, tandis que le Prince Pieuje a ordonné aux éclaireurs des Chevaliers du Temple de faire de même. On dirait que la main droite ignore ce que fait la main gauche !${prompt}
  12638: Le Monarlais Halver est furieux, mais il a d’abord besoin d’informations. Tu dois trouver l’éclaireur des Chevaliers du Temple, récupérer son rapport de reconnaissance, et ramener ce rapport au monarlais.${prompt}
  12639: 'Quoi ? On t’a dit de remettre le ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]} au Prince Pieuje en personne ?${prompt}'
  12640: Eh bien, tu devrais trouver Son Altesse dans la cathédrale.${prompt}
  12641: 'Tu arrives juste au bon moment ! Le Prince Trion veut te parler. Il semble qu’il ait entendu parler de toi lorsque tu as reçu ton ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12642: Rends-toi dans les appartements du Prince Trion à l’intérieur du Château d’Oraguille dès que tu seras présentable !${prompt}
  12643: Le Prince Trion t’a convoqué. Rends-toi dans ses appartements à l’intérieur du Château d’Oraguille dès que tu seras présentable !${prompt}
  12644: Je ne sais pas ce que le Prince Trion voulait que tu fasses, mais mène-le jusqu’au bout ! Compris ?${prompt}
  12645: Bonjour. Ce n’est pas le moment pour des missions ; le Château d’Oraguille a été infiltré par des bandits !${prompt}
  12646: Tu dois te hâter vers le Château d’Oraguille ! Trouve Dame Curilla, générale des Chevaliers du Temple !${prompt}
  12647: Des bandits infiltrant le Château d’Oraguille, c’est sans précédent dans l’histoire ! Hâte-toi et va voir Dame Curilla, générale des Chevaliers du Temple !${prompt}

  12650: J’essaie d’importer des marchandises de Vollbow, mais c’est tellement difficile d’obtenir des objets des zones qui ne sont pas sous le contrôle de San d’Oria.${prompt}
  12651: Qu’est-ce que c’est ? Tu veux en apprendre davantage sur les dragons ? Si seulement le Docteur Oiheaurese était…${prompt}
  12652: '…ici !${prompt}'
  12653: Docteur, cet aventurier se renseigne sur les dragons.${prompt}
  12654: Eh bien, notre aventurier est au bon endroit. Tout d’abord, jeune ${choice-player-gender}[garçon/fille], tu dois comprendre que là où il y a des dragons sacrés, il existe aussi des dragons maléfiques.${prompt}
  12655: Eh bien, Sir Rahal. Qu’est-ce qui nous vaut l’honneur de votre présence ici aujourd’hui ?${prompt}
  12656: Rien d’urgent, Docteur. Je me demandais juste si quelque chose d’étrange – des personnages suspects – avait été repéré dans cette zone récemment.${prompt}
  12657: Non… rien d’inhabituel, monsieur.${prompt}
  12658: Je vois… Je pensais juste que… peut-être le corps de… son corps était… non…${prompt}
  12659: Continuez.${prompt}
  12660: Ahem ! Maintenant qu’il est parti, où en étais-je ?${prompt}
  12661: Ah, oui. Comme je le disais, récemment, il y a eu une forte baisse du nombre de dragons nés à Vana’diel.${prompt}
  12662: C’est là que tu interviens. Il y a une rumeur selon laquelle une wyverne a pondu un œuf dans le Labyrinthe de Shakhrami.${prompt}
  12663: J’aimerais que tu excaves cet œuf et que tu le protèges des tueurs de dragons.${prompt}
  12664: Pour les empêcher de tuer la wyverne alors qu’elle est encore jeune, nous devons atteindre l’œuf avant eux.${prompt}
  12665: Le Docteur Oiheaurese a dit qu’un œuf de wyverne a été pondu au fin fond du Labyrinthe de Shakhrami. Cela pourrait-il être vrai ?${prompt}
  12666: |-
    Ah, c’est toi.
    Je suis désolé de t’informer que le Docteur Oiheaurese n’est pas disponible pour le moment. Peut-être est-il tombé malade. Son travail le tient éveillé tard dans la soirée.${prompt}
  12667: As-tu une affaire avec le docteur ? Eh bien, il est actuellement absent de la cathédrale.${prompt}
  12668: Et qui es-tu ? Je ne t’ai jamais vu par ici auparavant.${prompt}
  12669: Je m’appelle Yachemidot. Je suis ce que vous appelleriez un étudiant du Docteur Oiheaurese.${prompt}
  12670: Cet œuf ? Est-ce vraiment celui d’une wyverne ?${prompt}
  12671: Que dirais-tu d’essayer de faire éclore cet œuf ? Le docteur m’a dit que ce serait dangereux, mais j’aimerais tenter l’expérience. Tout vrai scientifique ressentirait la même chose.${prompt}
  12672: Et il se trouve que je sais comment faire. Es-tu prêt à aider ? Tu veux voir l’œuf éclore aussi, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}

  12674: Merveilleux ! Prends l’œuf et place-le à l’extrémité est de l’Échine de Drogaroga, située dans les Montagnes de Meriphataud.${prompt}
  12675: Ce n’est pas si difficile ! Tout ce que tu as à faire, c’est prendre l’œuf et le placer à l’extrémité est de l’Échine de Drogaroga, qui se trouve dans les Montagnes de Meriphataud.${prompt}
  12676: Si cette wyverne porte la crête sacrée, alors il y a une possibilité qu’un nouveau dragoon naisse !${prompt}
  12677: Je n’ai jamais entendu le Docteur mentionner un certain Yachemidot. Et qu’est-ce que c’est que cette histoire de placer l’œuf à l’extrémité est de l’Échine de Drogaroga dans les Montagnes de Meriphataud ?${prompt}
  12678: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}. Tu es venu.
    La famille royale requiert ton assistance.${prompt}
  12679: Je peux supposer que tu as entendu parler de l’Éclair de Lumière du défunt Roi Ranperre. Si cette épée tombait entre les mains des Orcs, San d’Oria se retrouverait dos au mur.${prompt}
  12680: Cette situation doit être évitée à tout prix.${prompt}
  12681: Nous avons des Chevaliers du Temple qui participent aux efforts de recherche, mais il y a un manque évident de main-d’œuvre.${prompt}
  12682: Nos érudits ont passé au peigne fin le texte ancien de San d’Oria que tu as récupéré, à la recherche de nouveaux indices.${prompt}
  12683: Je suis confiant qu’ils trouveront quelque chose.${prompt}
  12684: Si seulement la bibliothèque de la cathédrale avait survécu aux incendies de la Grande Guerre, nous ne serions pas si en retard dans nos recherches sur l’Éclair de Lumière.${prompt}
  12685: Votre Sainteté !${prompt}
  12686: Je m’excuse. Vous avez un visiteur…${prompt}
  12687: Ne t’en fais pas. Qu’y a-t-il, Morjean ?${prompt}
  12688: Oui, Votre Sainteté. Lors de la fouille de la bibliothèque, nous sommes tombés sur un parchemin ancien caché à l’intérieur d’un autre livre. Jusqu’à présent, nous l’avions pris pour un poème écrit par quelqu’un il y a longtemps.${prompt}
  12689: Cependant, après l’avoir déchiffré, nous avons réalisé qu’il s’agissait d’un message rapportant quelque chose de caché au fin fond de l’Oubliette de Bostaunieux pendant la Grande Guerre.${prompt}
  12690: Quoi ? Pourrait-il s’agir de l’épée sacrée, l’Éclair de Lumière ?${prompt}
  12691: Nous n’avons pas pu le déterminer à partir du contenu du parchemin, mais le fait est que cet objet a été caché pour une raison.${prompt}
  12692: Merci pour cette mise à jour. Tu peux partir maintenant.${prompt}
  12693: Nous devons rapporter ces nouvelles découvertes au roi immédiatement. Cela pourrait éclairer la localisation de l’Éclair de Lumière.${prompt}
  12694: Prince Pieuje, et si nous envoyions ${name-player} enquêter ?${prompt}
  12695: ${name-player} a été le premier à trouver le véritable lieu de repos du Roi Ranperre, et a la confiance du Roi Destin. Je pense qu’une recherche préliminaire de la zone est nécessaire avant qu’une étude complète ne soit menée.${prompt}
  12696: Prince Pieuje ! Vous devez agir avant le Prince Trion. Avez-vous déjà oublié l’incident à la Tombe du Roi Ranperre ?${prompt}
  12697: Je comprends vos paroles, Votre Sainteté, mais je pense qu’il est de mon devoir de d’abord rapporter ces nouvelles découvertes à mon père.${prompt}
  12698: 'Votre Sainteté.${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  12699: ${name-player}, veux-tu voyager jusqu’à l’Oubliette de Bostaunieux et enquêter sur ces découvertes ?${prompt}
  12700: À l’extérieur, le prince peut le nier, mais au fond de lui, il compte sur ton succès dans cette mission.${prompt}
  12701: Selon le parchemin récemment déchiffré, des scientifiques ont caché « quelque chose » dans l’Oubliette de Bostaunieux pendant la guerre. Je veux que tu descendes là-bas et que tu trouves cet objet.${prompt}
  12702: Je vois… Donc tu n’as pas trouvé l’Éclair de Lumière. Mais ce que tu as trouvé est véritablement une possession du Roi Dragon perdu.${prompt}
  12703: Votre Sainteté, les Chevaliers Royaux envoyés pour enquêter sur l’Oubliette de Bostaunieux sont revenus. Leur recherche n’a rien donné.${prompt}
  12704: Qu’est-ce que c’est !?${prompt}
  12705: Prince Pieuje, ${name-player} a récupéré cette tablette de pierre au fin fond de l’oubliette.${prompt}
  12706: Lorsque le grand Roi Ranperre a ramené l’ordre dans le chaos de San d’Oria, on dit que son admonition a été gravée dans la pierre.${prompt}
  12707: Ceci pourrait bien être cette tablette, mon prince.${prompt}
  12708: J’avais raison de penser que les Chevaliers Royaux ne seraient pas adaptés à une tâche comme celle-ci – une tâche qui exige de la persévérance.${prompt}
  12709: Cependant, nous ne pouvons pas être sûrs que cette tablette soit celle du Roi Ranperre…${prompt}
  12710: Absolument. Il reste encore beaucoup de déchiffrement à faire par nos érudits. Cela demandera beaucoup plus de temps.${prompt}
  12711: Cependant, je vous promets que je ferai de cette tâche notre priorité absolue.${prompt}
  12712: Quant au rapport sur notre découverte de la tablette, je m’en chargerai moi-même auprès du roi.${prompt}
  12713: Et pour toi, ${name-player}. Une fois le déchiffrement terminé, nous pourrions avoir une autre tâche pour toi.${prompt}
  12714: Bonne journée.${prompt}
  12715: Tu dis que tu étais sous les ordres du papsque ? Je suis désolé pour tous les ennuis qu’il a pu te causer.${prompt}
  12716: Quand il s’agit du sujet de l’Éclair de Lumière, le papsque devient un homme différent…${prompt}
  12717: Par la présente, je conclus la cérémonie de passage à l’âge adulte de Claidie I d’Oraguille.${prompt}
  12718: Ainsi, la petite princesse est enfin devenue une dame… Savais-tu qu’il est de coutume, lors de la cérémonie de passage à l’âge adulte, de révéler les secrets sombres des d’Oraguille ?${prompt}
  12719: Je suis sûr que tu as déjà entendu dire que pendant la Grande Guerre, la famille d’Oraguille a trahi mon père, Altedour, et a entraîné Tavnazia dans la ruine.${prompt}
  12720: Silence, infidèle !${prompt}
  12721: Qui es…${prompt}
  12722: D’où vient ce vagabond !?${prompt}

  12726: Le frère… de ma mère !?${prompt}
  12727: Rochefogne !? Tu as été tué pendant la Grande Guerre !${prompt}
  12728: Doutes-tu de tes propres yeux ? Pitoyable d’Oraguille. Ce sera votre perte à tous.${prompt}

Et en plus de ça, tu ne pourras invoquer que ce petit insecte bleu, Carbuncle !${prompt}
  12908: Et pour empirer les choses, personne d’autre ne pourra entrer dans le cristal avec toi ! Tu devras te battre en un contre un, d’homme à homme, Taru contre Taru !${prompt}

  12958: Coteaulepoint ? Que t’arrive-t-il ?${prompt}
  12959: |-
    Non… Cette voix…
    Tu n’es autre que le scélérat, Rochefogne !${prompt}
  12960: Peu m’importe ce spectacle que vous jouez pour votre propre amusement. Je suis venu pour une seule raison, et une seule – prendre l’Éclair de Lumière.${prompt}
  12961: Tu devrais être mort ! Que signifie tout cela !?${prompt}
  12962: Hah. Si tu fais référence aux assassins que tu as envoyés pour me tuer, tu pourrais peut-être les trouver… au fond de la Mer de Bastore.${prompt}
  12963: Leurs identités cachées m’ont simplement aidé à les effacer, sans que personne ne le remarque, de la surface de Vana’diel. Et c’est ainsi que j’ai réussi à m’incruster à votre petite fête.${prompt}
  12964: Si tu ne veux pas voir la tête de ta charmante sœur rouler sur le sol, tu ferais mieux de me remettre l’Éclair de Lumière.${prompt}
  12965: Espèce de…${prompt}
  12966: |-
    Comme tu veux, Rochefogne.
    Au compte de trois, je te lancerai l’épée sacrée, et tu laisseras la princesse partir.${prompt}
  12967: Un…${prompt}
  12968: Deux…${prompt}
  12969: 'TROIS !${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  12970: Une sage décision, Trion.${prompt}
  12971: |-
    Je n’ai pas besoin de tes louanges.
    Mais peut-être peux-tu nous éclairer – comment comptes-tu t’échapper alors que tu es entouré par nos Chevaliers Royaux ?${prompt}
  12972: Comparé à ce que j’ai traversé pour obtenir cette épée, m’échapper de cet endroit sera un jeu d’enfant.${prompt}
  12973: Et si l’épée que tu tiens n’était pas le véritable Éclair de Lumière ?${prompt}
  12974: |-
    Quoi ?
    Espèce de… !${prompt}
  12975: Nous t’attendions depuis le début. Quand ton corps n’a pas été retrouvé, nous avons supposé que tu étais encore là dehors, à planifier ton prochain coup. Cependant, nous ne nous attendions pas à ce que tu te fasses passer pour l’un des nôtres.${prompt}
  12976: Ugh…${prompt}
  12977: L’heure est venue de mettre fin à ta vie – et à l’obscurité qui l’entoure. Viens à moi, ô Éclair de Lumière !${prompt}
  12978: 'Trion ! Non !${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  12979: 'Claidie, maintenant !${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  12980: Nous ne pouvons pas laisser l’Éclair de Lumière tomber entre les mains de ces monstres !${prompt}
  12981: |-
    Que se passe-t-il ici ?
    Où est l’Éclair de Lumière !?${prompt}
  12982: Pourquoi !? L’épée a été dégainée, mais les Portes du Paradis ne se sont pas ouvertes !${prompt}
  12983: Les Portes du Paradis…?${prompt}
  12984: Hah ! Tu ne sais rien de ce que cette épée peut faire.${prompt}
  12985: Cette épée est l’arme maléfique qui a détruit mon pays…${prompt}
  12986: Comment le sais-tu ?${prompt}
  12987: Je le sais uniquement parce que c’est moi qui ai dégainé l’Éclair de Lumière et mis fin à ma patrie.${prompt}
  12988: Ce n’est pas possible !${prompt}
  12989: Ce n’est pas le moment d’expliquer. Cependant, Trion, tu sais maintenant pourquoi je dois sceller à nouveau l’épée sacrée.${prompt}
  12990: Quand j’ai retiré l’Éclair de Lumière de son fourreau, j’ai eu l’impression d’avoir tout Vana’diel dans le creux de ma main… comme si toute autre vie sur cette planète était inutile…${prompt}
  12991: Si ta sœur n’avait pas jeté le pollen de rose onirique sur toi, tu aurais certainement été consumé par le pouvoir de l’épée.${prompt}
  12992: Nous devons récupérer l’Éclair de Lumière des griffes des Orcs, puis le ramener à sa juste place dans la Tombe du Roi Ranperre. Si nous ne le faisons pas, un autre pays pourrait disparaître de la surface de… Vana’diel…${prompt}
  12993: Rochefogne !?${prompt}
  12994: Alors l’Éclair de Lumière n’est pas un porteur de lumière, mais un porteur d’obscurité…?${prompt}
  12995: |-
    Trion ! Trion !
    N’as-tu pas entendu Rochefogne ? Nous devons envoyer nos chevaliers immédiatement !${prompt}
  12996: '…${prompt}'
  12997: |-
    Trion ! Ressaisis-toi !
    Rahal ! Prépare les Chevaliers Royaux et traque ces Orcs !
    Curilla ! Double les patrouilles des Chevaliers du Temple dans la ville !
    Quant aux autres – retirons-nous au château pour planifier notre prochain mouvement. Rompez !${prompt}
  12998: |-
    Quant à toi, Shamonde…
    J’ai quelques questions…${prompt}
  12999: Est-ce notre manque de foi qui a apporté cette période de désespoir sur nous ?${prompt}
  13000: Le papsque est actuellement retenu au Château d’Oraguille pour un interrogatoire sur les affaires en cours. Je n’ai jamais vu Sa Sainteté aussi perturbée…${prompt}
  13001: À part ceux qui y ont assisté, personne ne sait ce qui s’est passé lors des Rites de Succession. Cependant, je dois rester fort pour ne pas inquiéter les membres de notre foi.${prompt}
  13002: |-
    ${name-player}…
    Je vois que tu as les mêmes doutes que moi.${prompt}
  13003: Nous aimerions voir le papsque en privé.${prompt}
  13004: Votre Altesse, j’ai reçu des ordres stricts de ne laisser personne approcher Sa Sainteté sans l’accompagnement d’un Chevalier du Temple…${prompt}
  13005: |-
    Je comprends tes ordres. C’est moi qui les ai donnés.
    Maintenant, écarte-toi. Je prendrai toute la responsabilité des actions entreprises par le papsque.${prompt}
  13006: Oui, Votre Altesse.${prompt}
  13007: Votre… Sainteté.${prompt}
  13008: Prince Pieuje…${prompt}
  13009: Puis-je vous poser une question ? Pourquoi as-tu fait dégainer l’Éclair de Lumière à mon frère pour ouvrir les Portes du Paradis ?${prompt}
  13010: |-
    Les Portes du Paradis…
    Lorsque la guerre a pris fin et que j’ai vu de mes propres yeux ce qu’il restait de Tavnazia, j’étais convaincu que le seul moyen de sauver le monde était de trouver et d’ouvrir ces portes.${prompt}
  13011: Mais que sont exactement les Portes du Paradis ?${prompt}
  13012: J’ai consulté des centaines d’ouvrages littéraires… Cependant, la véritable signification des Portes du Paradis est restée un mystère.${prompt}
  13013: J’étais sur le point d’abandonner mes recherches, quand un jour, le jeune frère de l’Archiduc de Jeuno m’a rendu visite ici, dans cette cathédrale. C’est alors qu’il m’a dit que l’Éclair de Lumière était la clé pour ouvrir les portes.${prompt}
  13014: Seigneur Eald’narche ?${prompt}
  13015: Mais si ce n’était pas vrai, pourquoi aurait-il dit une telle chose…? Penser que l’Éclair de Lumière pourrait être la cause de tant de douleur et de souffrance…${prompt}
  13016: Maintenant, j’ai enfin réalisé que les véritables Portes du Paradis ne se trouvent pas dans un monde imaginaire, mais ici, dans nos cœurs. Et peut-être est-il temps que j’ouvre les portes dans le mien…${prompt}
  13017: Le Paradis réside dans nos cœurs…${prompt}
  13018: Bien que mon âme soit encore lourde des péchés que j’ai commis contre ce grand royaume, Son Altesse m’a accordé l’amnistie.${prompt}
  13019: À partir de ce jour, jusqu’au jour où je me tiendrai devant la Déesse pour le jugement, je concentrerai mes prières sur l’apport d’espoir à tous ceux sur Vana’diel.${prompt}
  13020: |-
    Je croirai tes paroles, mais à partir de ce jour, je souhaite suivre mon propre chemin vers le Paradis.
    Je prie pour que nos deux rêves se réalisent.${prompt}
  13021: |-
    Le papsque est revenu du Château d’Oraguille et va maintenant expier ses péchés.
    Il sera autorisé à exercer ses fonctions normales, cependant, une escorte de Chevaliers du Temple l’accompagnera lorsqu’il quittera la cathédrale.${prompt}
  13022: Peut-être est-il temps de reconsidérer le rôle des Portes du Paradis. Que les péchés du papsque nous guident vers un meilleur chemin.${prompt}

    Et maintenant…
    Supposons qu’un objet que tu as obtenu dans ta convoitise pour les possessions matérielles ait été altéré par la colère des esprits.${prompt}

  13097: Une abjuration est la seule et unique clé capable de calmer les esprits et de lever la malédiction. Cela demande de grandes épreuves et souffrances pour en obtenir une ; cependant, cette pénitence est nécessaire pour la purification de ton âme.${prompt}

  13101: C’est très regrettable… Cependant, si tu n’as pas l’abjuration appropriée pour contrer la malédiction, je ne peux pas effectuer la cérémonie de purification. Lorsque tu auras obtenu l’abjuration, reviens à mes côtés.${prompt}
  13102: En vérité, voici l’abjuration requise. Tu as bien fait. Si tu apportes l’objet maudit correspondant, je procéderai immédiatement à la cérémonie de purification.${prompt}
  13103: Hmm ? Ah, mes excuses, j’étais perdu dans mes pensées. Y a-t-il quelque chose dont je pourrais t’aider, mon enfant ?${prompt}
  13104: Louée soit la Déesse ! Tu es revenu sain et sauf de l’épreuve des esprits. Procédons à la cérémonie de purification sans tarder. À mon signal, lève ta main en supplication vers les cieux.${prompt}

  13111: La mission consiste à escorter la noble jeune demoiselle Lady Cannau, la fille unique d’une famille très respectable. Cependant, elle est – comment dire – un peu turbulente. J’ai honte de rapporter que de nombreux aventuriers fiers ont déjà abandonné cette tâche dès qu’ils l’ont rencontrée.${prompt}

  13142: |-
    Bonjour, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame].
    Je suis avec le Réseau d’Aide Mutuelle des Aventuriers (AMAN) et je prends actuellement les candidatures pour de nouveaux ${color: 5}mentors${color: 1}.${prompt}
  13143: |-
    Qu’est-ce qu’un mentor, vous demandez-vous ?
    Eh bien, en résumé, un mentor est un aventurier expérimenté qui est prêt à offrir un peu de son temps pour aider ses compagnons moins expérimentés.${prompt}
  13144: Si cela te semble être un rôle pour toi, alors n’hésite pas à t’inscrire aujourd’hui.${prompt}
  13145: 'Pour devenir mentor, tu dois avoir complété l’objectif des Records of Eminence ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}.${prompt}'
  13146: 'Accepter ${unknown: 0x01054082808080} nécessite que tu aies plus de 180 heures de temps de jeu…${prompt}'
  13147: '…et que tu aies complété l’objectif des Records of Eminence ${unknown: 0x01054082828080}.${prompt}'
  13148: Veuillez noter que s’inscrire et servir en tant que mentor, ainsi qu’utiliser les services du Programme de Mentorat, se font à la discrétion du joueur.${prompt}
  13149: SQUARE ENIX ne sera pas tenu responsable des actions et/ou commentaires des mentors. Aucun avantage d’aucune sorte ne sera fourni à ceux qui choisissent de participer au Programme de Mentorat.${prompt}
  13150: En acceptant de participer au Programme de Mentorat, tu reconnais avoir lu et compris les termes mentionnés ci-dessus.${prompt}
  13151: 'Je suis désolé, mais tu ne remplis pas les conditions nécessaires pour accepter l’objectif des Records of Eminence ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}.${prompt}'
  13152: 'Veuille me parler à nouveau une fois que tu auras accepté ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}. Je jugerai alors si tu remplis ou non les conditions.${prompt}'
  13153: 'Tu as accepté ${unknown: 0x01054082808080}, oui ? Alors laisse-moi vérifier mes documents ici…${prompt}'
  13154: Félicitations ! Tu es qualifié pour être mentor !${prompt}
  13155: Mes documents ici indiquent que tu ne remplis pas les conditions. Continue d’y travailler !${prompt}
  13156: |-
    Souhaites-tu servir en tant que mentor ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  13157: Tu es maintenant un mentor inscrit.${prompt}
  13158: |-
    Tu peux activer le « Statut de Mentor » en utilisant la commande ${color: 5}/mentor on${color: 1}.
    Tu peux désactiver ce statut en utilisant ${color: 5}/mentor off${color: 1}.${prompt}

  13162: Tu veux en savoir plus sur les mannequins ? Ha ha, voilà un mot que je n’ai pas entendu depuis bien longtemps. Que pourrait vouloir un jeune aventurier comme toi avec une pièce aussi démodée ?${prompt}
  13163: |-
    Eh bien, je ne suis pas du genre à juger les goûts des gens.
    Oui, il fut un temps où nous, à la Guilde des Charpentiers, fabriquions presque tous les mannequins du Royaume. C’étaient nos meilleures ventes.${prompt}
  13164: Eh bien, ce catalogue que tu as là – c’était l’un des nombreux publiés et imprimés par nous.${prompt}
  13165: Nous avions tant de commandes que nous devions travailler vingt-cinq heures par jour pour suivre le rythme. C’est-à-dire, jusqu’à l’accident…${prompt}
  13166: Hmph. Je peux voir à l’expression de ton visage que tu veux que je continue. Très bien…${prompt}
  13167: Il devait y avoir un grand défilé de mode organisé par la Guilde des Tisserands à Windurst, et ils avaient besoin d’une grande quantité de mannequins pour exposer tous leurs nouveaux vêtements et armures.${prompt}
  13168: C’était une entreprise colossale. Cependant, honoré de recevoir une commande aussi importante de la Fédération, le maître de guilde de l’époque a accepté le défi sans hésitation.${prompt}
  13169: Et, comme promis, la guilde a terminé tous les mannequins magnifiquement construits dans le délai imparti et les a envoyés à Windurst.${prompt}
  13170: Cependant, alors que l’expédition était transportée le long du Canal Phanauet à travers la Forêt de Jugner, le ferry a été attaqué par des hommes-bêtes. Ces monstres ont dû penser que le navire était un vaisseau de transport pour des chevaliers et des provisions.${prompt}
  13171: Les quelques aventuriers qui accompagnaient le navire n’étaient pas de taille face à l’ennemi, et le navire ainsi que sa cargaison furent perdus…${prompt}
  13172: Quelques jours plus tard, notre guilde a reçu un message de Windurst disant qu’ils refusaient de payer pour les mannequins volés, allant jusqu’à citer notre négligence dans la protection de l’expédition comme justification. Outragée par cette violation flagrante du contrat, notre guilde a continué à exiger le paiement. Cette sorte de « querelle » a duré des années.${prompt}
  13173: |-
    Mais ce n’était pas le seul problème qui a découlé de l’accident…
    Des semaines après l’attaque, les hommes-bêtes ont commencé à jeter les bras, les jambes et les têtes de leurs « trophées » par-dessus les murs de notre ville et dans nos rues. C’était comme s’ils se vantaient de leur victoire.${prompt}
  13174: Voir cela a rempli les cœurs des habitants de la ville de peur. Les mannequins sont rapidement devenus un symbole de malheur, et ceux qui restaient dans les boutiques et les guildes ont été détruits.${prompt}
  13175: En tant qu’artisan, cela me peine de savoir que des superstitions oisives ont pris une telle importance sur un travail de qualité. Et c’est pourquoi, en tant qu’artisan, j’apporte mon soutien total à quiconque souhaite recréer un tel produit. Malheureusement, notre guilde n’a plus aucun des matériaux nécessaires pour construire un mannequin, et je ne connais personne qui possède les compétences pour fabriquer les pièces nécessaires.${prompt}
  13176: |-
    Ah, mais j’ai quelque chose qui pourrait t’être utile.
    L’orfèvre qui a fabriqué les articulations pour nos mannequins a laissé ces schémas. Ils ne me sont d’aucune utilité… Peut-être que si un orfèvre les voyait, ces plans pourraient donner un indice sur leur fabrication.${prompt}
  13177: 'Je peux aussi te dire qu’en plus des articulations, les pièces suivantes étaient nécessaires pour compléter un mannequin : ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  13178: Cependant, tu ne trouveras aucun de ces objets en vente aux enchères. Leur vente est interdite depuis l’accident. S’il en reste, ils seraient entre les mains des hommes-bêtes eux-mêmes.${prompt}
  13179: Es-tu prêt pour une épreuve terrifiante et éprouvante qui mettra ton courage à l’épreuve, kupo !?${prompt}
  13180: |-
    Nous avons placé un marqueur secret quelque part dans les entrailles d’un cachot effrayant.

    Tu ne portes pas ton yukata !
    Mets-le et montre-moi à quoi tu ressembles, kupo !${prompt}
  13184: Voici ta récompense pour avoir atteint l’objectif, kupo !${prompt}
  13185: |-
    Porte le yukata la prochaine fois que tu viendras me voir !
    J’ai hâte de voir à quoi tu ressembles, kupo !${prompt}

    Fais équipe avec plein d’aventuriers différents et ramène toutes sortes de trophées pour prouver ton courage !
    Quand tu en auras ramené assez, je te donnerai quelque chose de vraiment spécial, kupo !${prompt}
  13187: |-
    Le visage sur le portrait que tu m’as apporté est juste…
    Kupupupu !${prompt}
  13188: |-
    Incroyable, kupo !
    Tu dois avoir des nerfs en acier noir !
    Tiens, tu as mérité ça, kupo !${prompt}
  13189: |-
    Tu as replongé dans le cachot redouté, kupo ?
    Eh bien, tu mérites une petite récompense pour ta persévérance surnaturelle, kupo.${prompt}
  13190: |-
    Tu n’as pas encore gagné mon cadeau vraiment spécial !
    Seuls les véritables explorateurs de cachots intrépides l’obtiennent, kupo !${prompt}
  13191: Cela ne suffit pas pour prouver que vous avez atteint l’objectif en tant que duo d’explorateurs de cachots. Tu dois m’apporter l’objet que ton partenaire a reçu pour montrer que vous avez tous les deux réussi, kupo !${prompt}
  13192: |-
    Pour participer à cette confrontation effrayante contre la peur, tu as besoin d’un partenaire qui puisse prouver que vous avez atteint l’objectif.
    Reviens quand tu auras un compagnon courageux, kupo !${prompt}
  13193: |-
    Cette aventure dans l’adversité est uniquement disponible pour les groupes de deux personnes.
    Séparez-vous en paires et parlez-moi à nouveau, kupo !${prompt}
  13194: |-
    Veuillez revenir avec un partenaire différent.
    Ce ne sera pas amusant de vous effrayer si vos réactions sont trop similaires, kupo !${prompt}
  13195: |-
    Ton partenaire n’est pas prêt à partir.
    Veuillez attendre un peu plus longtemps, kupo.${prompt}
  13196: |-
    Ton partenaire doit aussi me parler.
    Je vous attendrai quand vous serez prêts, kupo.${prompt}
  13197: |-
    Tu ne peux choisir qu’un partenaire par jour.
    Reviens demain, kupo !${prompt}
  13198: |-
    Attends un peu ! On dirait que ton candidat pour une compagnie courageuse a déjà un partenaire !
    Tu ne peux pas choisir cette personne pour le moment, kupo !${prompt}
  13199: Veuillez attendre un peu plus longtemps ou trouver un nouveau partenaire avant de revenir, kupo.${prompt}
  13200: Es-tu prêt à tester ton courage, kupo ?${prompt}
  13201: |-
    Are you ready to go?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ready, kupo!
    I'm too terrified, kupo!${prompt}
  13202: |-
    I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal.
    You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.${prompt}
  13203: |-
    If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!
    Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt}
  13204: 'You can only carry one ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  13205: Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?${prompt}

    Hey, you changed partners!
    You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt}
  13207: |-
    Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!
    You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt}
  13208: |-
    Choose your partner wisely.
    Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!${prompt}
  13209: Boo-hah-hah～...kupo!${prompt}
  13210: |-
    Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror?
    I would've died of fright, kupo!${prompt}
  13211: |-
    Here, take this as a testament to your courage.
    Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!${prompt}
  13212: Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!${prompt}
  13213: |-
    Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo!
    Kupupupu...${prompt}
  13214: |-
    This place is crawling with nasties.
    You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.${prompt}
  13215: Why do ghosts say “boo,” anyway?${prompt}
  13216: |-
    I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage.
    This place definitely qualifies, kupo!${prompt}
  13217: Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?${prompt}
  13218: If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...${prompt}

  13268: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  13269: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  13270: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  13271: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  13272: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  13273: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  13274: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  13275: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  13276: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  13277: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  13278: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  13279: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  13280: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  13281: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  13282: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  13283: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  13284: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  13285: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  13286: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  13287: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  13288: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  13289: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  13290: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  13291: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  13292: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  13293: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  13294: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  13295: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}

    Donc, voici la Cathédrale de San d'Oria...

  13299: Si quelqu'un tente vraiment d'ouvrir les Portes du Paradis, je suis certain que c'est quelqu'un à l'intérieur...${prompt}
  13300: Avez-vous perdu votre chemin dans la vie ? Venez, écoutez notre sermon. Laissez-nous être votre guide vers la lumière du Paradis.${prompt}
  13301: |-
    Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
    Vous souhaitez en savoir plus sur l'Expédition Multinationale et sa quête de la Porte des Dieux ?${prompt}
  13302: C'est assez étrange... Il y a à peine quelques instants, un autre est venu poser les mêmes questions. Je crois que son nom était Ulmia. Est-elle une de vos connaissances ?${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  13304: |-
    Je vois.
    Ulmia aussi voulait en savoir plus sur la Porte des Dieux, donc je lui ai suggéré d'assister au prochain sermon sur le sujet.${prompt}
  13305: Oui, vous pouvez bien sûr y assister également. Mon sermon va commencer dans un instant.${prompt}
  13306: Abandonnez tout désir et embrassez Altana. Ce n'est qu'alors qu'elle vous bénira de sa gloire.${prompt}
  13307: C'est tout pour le sermon d'aujourd'hui. Que le Paradis vous ouvre ses portes.${prompt}
  13308: Je suis reconnaissant d'avoir eu l'occasion d'écouter votre sermon.${prompt}
  13309: Cependant, il y a encore beaucoup de choses que je ne comprends pas. Seriez-vous assez aimable pour prendre quelques instants pour répondre à mes questions ?${prompt}
  13310: Bien sûr, mon enfant. Qu'est-ce que vous souhaitez savoir ?${prompt}
  13311: Quand j'étais jeune, j'entendais souvent les histoires du Paradis.${prompt}
  13312: |-
    Une terre légendaire où les dieux dorment...
    Une porte menant à cette terre, découverte par les anciens...${prompt}
  13313: Cependant, selon les histoires que j'ai entendues, les anciens ont irrité le Dieu du Crépuscule en tentant d'ouvrir la porte interdite. En punition, il a jeté sur eux une terrible malédiction...${prompt}
  13314: Si cette histoire horrible est vraie, alors pourquoi la Cathédrale de San d'Oria essaie-t-elle de convaincre les gens que nous devrions ouvrir ces portes...?${prompt}
  13315: Ou la cathédrale a-t-elle découvert une méthode pour apaiser la colère des dieux ?${prompt}
  13316: |-
    ...
    Je dois supposer que vous n'êtes pas de notre royaume.${prompt}
  13317: C'est exact. Je suis né dans le Marquisat de Tavnazia et baptisé par la Cathédrale de Tavnazia.${prompt}
  13318: Notre église enseigne aussi sur les Portes des Dieux - les Portes du Paradis. Cependant, on nous dit que c'est une ligne que les enfants de Vana'diel n'ont pas le droit de franchir.${prompt}
  13319: L'exact opposé de ce qu'enseigne la Cathédrale de San d'Oria...${prompt}
  13320: Depuis vingt ans, nous avons recherché sans relâche une entrée pour le Paradis.${prompt}
  13321: Et c'est durant cette recherche que nous avons réalisé que le seul chemin pour apaiser la colère du Dieu du Crépuscule est d'abandonner tout désir et d'embrasser Altana.${prompt}
  13322: C'est tout...?${prompt}
  13323: |-
    Je m'excuse, mais je dois me préparer pour mon prochain sermon.
    Si vous souhaitez en apprendre davantage, demandez à l'un des grands prêtres.${prompt}
  13324: C'est le travail de vie de nos missionnaires d'éclairer. Puissent-ils vous guider dans la direction de la vérité...${prompt}
  13325: Avant la Grande Guerre, lorsque l'ancien pape, Muchavatte P Couchiret, était encore parmi nous...${prompt}
  13326: Pendant son règne, nous croyions que les Portes du Paradis étaient cachées quelque part à portée de l'homme mortel.${prompt}
  13327: Le Chevalier Royal que vous cherchez, Francmage M Mistalle, a rejoint l'Expédition Multinationale il y a trente ans pour rechercher la vérité derrière cette croyance. Et c'est à cause de cette quête...${prompt}
  13328: Bienvenue, voyageurs. Même après avoir écouté le sermon du vicasque, vous avez encore des questions concernant le Paradis ?${prompt}
  13329: Très bien. Veuillez, suivez-moi et je vais essayer d'étancher votre soif de connaissance.${prompt}
  13330: C'est le Reliquaire de la cathédrale. Il a été construit en souvenir de l'un de nos anciens papes, Muchavatte P Couchiret.${prompt}
  13331: Pendant son pontificat, le pape s'est consacré à guérir les blessures dans les cœurs des hommes - blessures laissées par les flammes de la guerre.${prompt}
  13332: La Déesse de l'Aube veillait sur lui et son travail, et l'a béni de sa gloire.${prompt}
  13333: Cependant, ce n'est pas tout ce qu'elle lui a donné. Avant sa mort, Altana a montré au pape le chemin vers le Paradis.${prompt}
  13334: Le chemin vers le Paradis...?${prompt}
  13335: Oui. Ses derniers mots nous ont dit que pour obtenir le Paradis, on doit abandonner tout désir et embrasser la Déesse de l'Aube.${prompt}
  13336: Pendant de nombreuses années, nous avons cru que le chemin vers le Paradis et les portes qui le gardent étaient des choses qui existaient réellement sur Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13337: La cathédrale a fouillé à travers les anciens tomes et documents dans nos voûtes, est allée en guerre avec d'autres nations...${prompt}
  13338: J'ai entendu dire que San d'Oria avait même attaqué la Cathédrale de Tavnazia... Tout cela pour trouver un Paradis qui était censé exister uniquement dans nos cœurs...${prompt}
  13339: Inculquer la peur pour trouver une terre où l'humanité pourrait vivre sans peur. Ce paradoxe a finalement mis de la distance entre nous et Altana.${prompt}
  13340: Mais grâce aux enseignements de Muchavatte, nous avons réalisé l'erreur de nos voies et avons donc fait de notre mission d'éclairer nos frères et sœurs sur le véritable chemin vers le Paradis.${prompt}
  13341: Comprenez-vous ?${prompt}
  13342: Oui, je crois que oui.${prompt}
  13343: Cependant, j'ai une dernière question. Comment pouvons-nous nous libérer de la malédiction du Dieu du Crépuscule ?${prompt}
  13344: C'est...${prompt}
  13345: Il est interdit de parler de l'abhorré(e).${prompt}
  13346: De toutes choses, vous devriez bien le savoir, enfant de Tavnazia.${prompt}
  13347: '...${prompt}'
  13348: Voyageurs, vous n'avez pas besoin de vous inquiéter.${prompt}
  13349: C'est notre devoir de servir Altana et d'introduire sa lumière bénie aux masses défavorisées.${prompt}
  13350: Si nous suivons les enseignements de la Déesse de l'Aube et ne nous écartons pas du chemin de la droiture, les chaînes du mal seront brisées et les Portes du Paradis s'ouvriront.${prompt}
  13351: |-
    Oui... Je comprends maintenant...
    Merci beaucoup pour votre gentillesse à nous expliquer tout cela.${prompt}
  13352: Non, vous n'avez pas besoin de me remercier. Je suis simplement heureux de savoir que vous comprenez maintenant la vérité derrière le Paradis.${prompt}
  13353: Attendez...${prompt}
  13354: Vous avez dit que vous cherchez le Chevalier Royal Francmage M Mistalle, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  13355: Si je ne me trompe pas, je me souviens d'une section de la Forêt de Jugner appelée le Quai des Charpentiers, qui appartient aux Chevaliers Mistalle.${prompt}
  13356: Je ne pense pas que vous pourrez atteindre la manoir, mais vous pourriez trouver certains de ses hommes près de l'eau à collecter du bois de chauffage.${prompt}
  13357: Ah, l'aventurier avec qui j'ai conversé dans le reliquaire...${prompt}
  13358: Vous dites que vous recherchez un certain Seigneur Louverance, un émissaire de la cathédrale ?${prompt}
  13359: Il serait le petit-fils de Francmage M Mistalle, le Chevalier Royal que vous enquêtiez précédemment.${prompt}
  13360: Il est de notoriété publique que Sir Louverance a pris sa retraite des Chevaliers Royaux ; cependant, je n'ai entendu parler de rien concernant son enrôlement dans l'ordre des Chevaliers du Temple.${prompt}
  13361: Si nous, les hauts prêtres, n'avons pas été informés de son retour au service militaire, il doit être chargé d'une mission d'une importance extrême.${prompt}
  13362: Il me semble que si Seigneur Louverance voyage par aéronef, le meilleur endroit pour le chercher serait le port. N'êtes-vous pas d'accord ?${prompt}
  13363: Je n'étais pas conscient que Seigneur Louverance agissait comme un émissaire pour la cathédrale.${prompt}
  13364: Cependant, s'il voyage par aéronef, peut-être devriez-vous attendre son retour à San d'Oria au port.${prompt}
  13365: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}.
    Ma curiosité a été suffisamment éveillée pour que je mène ma propre enquête sur les Chevaliers Mistalle...${prompt}
  13366: |-
    C'est un plaisir de vous revoir, Grand Prêtre Chasalvige.
    J'ai peur d'avoir négligé de me présenter correctement lors de notre première rencontre.${prompt}
  13367: |-
    Je m'appelle Ulmia.
    On m'a conseillé de demander votre conseil par Lady Hinaree.${prompt}
  13368: Maintenant, je comprends.${prompt}
  13369: La raison de votre grand intérêt pour la nature du Paradis et la malédiction du Dieu du Crépuscule m'est claire.${prompt}
  13370: |-
    Dame Ulmia.
    Et vous, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13371: |-
    Vous n'avez pas à craindre d'être entendu ici.
    Soyons entièrement honnêtes l'un envers l'autre et parlons librement de ces sujets.${prompt}
  13372: '... Concernant les efforts de la chorale de Tavnazia pour compléter les cinq versets.${prompt}'
  13373: Vous connaissez la chanson...?${prompt}
  13374: Avant l'avènement de la Grande Guerre, vous êtes venu rendre visite à Dame Hinaree avec le Cardinal Mildaurion et son compagnon, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  13375: J'ai été autorisé à accompagner le Papsque Muchavatte et j'étais présent aux procédures.${prompt}
  13376: Je suis certain qu'à cette époque, vous n'aviez qu'une vague idée de la raison de cette réunion.${prompt}
  13377: En fait, c'était une réunion pour améliorer les relations défaillantes entre les cathédrales de San d'Oria et de Tavnazia.${prompt}
  13378: "En particulier, il semblait n'y avoir aucune fin aux rumeurs désagréables entourant la Cathédrale de Tavnazia. \nCela était peut-être dû à la politique stricte de secret adoptée par les Tavnazi à la suite de la période de conflit interne à San d'Oria.${prompt}"
  13379: Le papsque a envoyé un messager pour déterminer l'exactitude de ces rumeurs.${prompt}
  13380: Cependant, le Cardinal Mildaurion est arrivé accompagné de deux jeunes filles.${prompt}
  13381: Et l'une de ces filles - vous, Ulmia - a chanté une certaine chanson...${prompt}
  13382: |-
    Oui, je m'en souviens.
    Mais ma voix était encore inexpérimentée et Papsque Muchavatte s'est fâché contre mon chant affreux.${prompt}
  13383: |-
    Non, enfant, ce n'est pas pour cela qu'il était en colère.
    La raison de l'éclat du papsque était sa peur que la chanson que vous chantiez soit complétée...${prompt}
  13384: Il était affolé à l'idée de contenir le pouvoir redoutable de cette chanson.${prompt}
  13385: Pouvoir redoutable ?${prompt}
  13386: Il est peut-être préférable que vous soyez restée dans l'ignorance de la vérité.${prompt}
  13387: |-
    Cette histoire commence il y a presque cinq cents ans...
    Elle remonte à une époque considérée comme une période d'humiliation pour les Elvaan.${prompt}
  13388: À cette époque, le continent de Quon était sous le contrôle d'une armée envoyée par la Fédération de Windurst.${prompt}
  13389: La race des Elvaan n'avait pas encore formé sa propre nation, et les nombreuses tribus vivaient dans des forêts isolées les unes des autres.${prompt}
  13390: |-
    Mais, comme aujourd'hui, le sang des Elvaan était rempli de fierté.
    Jurant la victoire sur son épée, le héros Lanfeaur d'Oraguille est venu pour conduire notre peuple vers la liberté.${prompt}
  13391: Avec le Général Alphollon Tajeux, qui deviendrait plus tard le Marquis de Tavnazia, ils ont fondé un royaume grâce à deux artefacts de grande valeur.${prompt}
  13392: Cependant, après la bataille pour émanciper les Elvaan, ces deux trésors ont été perdus.${prompt}
  13393: À leur place respective dans les cathédrales de San d'Oria et de Tavnazia, deux mystérieuses tablettes de pierre ont été laissées.${prompt}
  13394: Nous avons travaillé dur pour résoudre les énigmes des tablettes, et nous avons finalement réussi à récupérer l'un des objets à l'époque du Roi Ranperre - l'épée sacrée, Lightbringer.${prompt}
  13395: Malgré ce succès, la Cathédrale de Tavnazia a refusé de révéler le contenu de la deuxième tablette.${prompt}
  13396: Une enquête secrète initiée par la Cathédrale de San d'Oria a découvert que les écrits sur la pierre étaient en réalité les vers d'une chanson.${prompt}
  13397: |-
    Oui, vous connaissez bien cette chanson...
    C'était le Chant des Immortels.${prompt}
  13398: C'était une chanson qui se conclurait par la manifestation d'une divinité.${prompt}
  13399: |-
    Une chanson pour appeler les dieux !?
    Je ne savais pas...${prompt}
  13400: |-
    La Cathédrale de Tavnazia avait déchiffré les paroles, mais la mélodie leur échappait encore.
    La recherche de quelqu'un capable de chanter la chanson fut apparemment longue et ardue.${prompt}
  13401: Cependant, quand vous êtes apparue et avez pu chanter le premier verset, la chanson a montré ses premiers signes de pouvoir.${prompt}
  13402: |-
    Mais moi... !
    On m'a dit que le chant était pour prouver que Prishe n'était pas l'abhorrée !${prompt}
  13403: Je le sais. C'est pourquoi je vous ai fait venir ici pour expliquer la vérité derrière ces affaires.${prompt}
  13404: 'J''ai appris de ${choice: 2}[Dame Hinaree/cet aventurier] qu''un chevalier recherche le Cardinal Mildaurion sur ordre de la Cathédrale de San d''Oria.${prompt}'
  13405: De ce que j'ai pu découvrir, il est allé dans les Terres du Nord pour en apprendre plus sur le Dieu du Crépuscule.${prompt}
  13406: '!${prompt}'
  13407: Je ne sais pas à quelle fin, mais le Cardinal Mildaurion cherchait également des connaissances concernant Promathia.${prompt}
  13408: Cardinal Mildaurion !?${prompt}
  13409: |-
    Écoutez bien mes paroles.
    N'oubliez jamais l'importance de cette chanson, ni votre propre valeur en tant que détenteur de ses mystères. Si le cardinal découvre que vous êtes encore en vie...${prompt}
  13410: '...!?${prompt}'
  13411: |-
    Dame Ulmia, je vous en supplie :
    Retrouvez votre compagnon et retournez à Tavnazia.${prompt}
  13412: J'ai parlé avec les chercheurs de Beaucedine à propos de Seigneur Louverance.${prompt}
  13413: D'après ce que j'ai pu rassembler, votre ami a probablement été transporté au Rhinostère dans la Fédération de Windurst.${prompt}
  13414: |-
    C'est une bonne nouvelle !
    Merci, Grand Prêtre Chasalvige.

    Eh? That hag Reinberta told you I could help?
    Here, let me see that scroll...${prompt}
  13513: Hmph. All this fancy jade... Reinberta would like something as useless as this. A good old iron clasp, now that's all you need. Sturdy, inexpensive, and practical, let me tell you...${prompt}
  13514: Ahem... Now, what does this Albanus character have to say...?${prompt}
  13515: |-
    Hm...
    Hrm...
    So that is what he means...${prompt}
  13516: It seems that the alloy our bellmaker is speaking of in his diary and on this scroll is Minstrel Metal.${prompt}
  13517: What? You've never heard of it? Well, of course you haven't. The method for making it has been lost for decades.${prompt}
  13518: Minstrel Metal receives its name from the enchanting sound that it emits when struck.${prompt}
  13519: The tones are so beautiful, that it was said people would come from around the Kingdom just to hear the ballads created during the alloy's forging.${prompt}
  13520: I believe that this scroll illustrates the lost method of smelting Minstrel Metal...but it is all written in some strange code. I can only guess the author did not want anyone to steal his techniques.${prompt}
  13521: But if that author really was Albanus, then the cryptic message would make some sense.${prompt}
  13522: You see, I have heard tales of the eccentric young bellmaker...${prompt}
  13523: Once, long ago, there was a novice goldsmith named Albanus who spent day and night studying the art of bellmaking. He was quite a prodigy, people said.${prompt}
  13524: Most of the time, the young man would lock himself up in his room behind the guild and pound away at his Minstrel Metal, until one day a strange boy called upon Albanus.${prompt}
  13525: The boy said he had been drawn to the “voices of the angels,” and asked if he could stay with Albanus.${prompt}
  13526: At first the bellmaker was puzzled, but soon grew fond of the boy and his appreciation of Albanus's work. And though he himself was still an amateur, he allowed the boy to become his pupil, and proceeded to teach him the ways of smithing.${prompt}
  13527: However, it turned out that the pupil did more teaching than the master. The boy began telling Albanus how he was to create his bells, and it was not long before the boy's influence was heard in the song that rang forth from the novice goldsmith's workshop.${prompt}
  13528: But then one day, the sound stopped. Just as suddenly as the strange boy had appeared, he had vanished, and along with him, young Albanus...${prompt}
  13529: Some say that the zealous bellmaker simply left on a journey to discover new materials and techniques...${prompt}
  13530: '...While others say it was the boy that forced Albanus to leave...${prompt}'
  13531: They say that he had found a way inside Albanus's mind and made him go mad...${prompt}
  13532: |-
    But if you ask me, I don't think it was either.
    You see, the job of an artist is to move the hearts of the masses.${prompt}
  13533: However, when an artist becomes too attached to his own work, strange things can begin to occur.${prompt}
  13534: Eh? You still don't understand what I'm trying to say?${prompt}
  13535: Haven't you been listening at all!?${prompt}
  13536: When an artist spends his whole life working on something, a part of his soul is sometimes transferred to the piece.${prompt}
  13537: I cannot fully explain the existence of these newborn “spirits,” but there are many who believe in them.${prompt}
  13538: However, one thing I can be certain of is this--if the boy who led poor Albanus away was truly born from a raw form of the bellmaker's passion, then he may be quite dangerous...${prompt}
  13539: |-
    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Vicious villains are venting violently outside the city walls, kupo!${prompt}
  13540: We've divined that these creatures are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt}
  13541: |-
    But never fear!
    Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these invaders!
    Behold the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo!${prompt}
  13542: The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt}

  13553: Have you ever heard of Blitz Buffalo, kupo? It's a fast and frenzied buffalo-chasing fiasco ferried in from a land to the far west of Quon!${prompt}
  13554: We moogles thought it sounded like fun! So we rounded up a bunch of buffalos and set them loose in several places, kupo!${prompt}
  13555: Also, we've tied an item to each buffalo! Anyone who catches one can keep the item as a reward! It's a great opportunity for adventurers, kupo!${prompt}
  13556: But the buffalos aren't going to take a bunch of frantic adventurers chasing them lightly! You may have to knock one out before it yields its precious item, kupo!${prompt}
  13557: If you manage to lay your hands on a buffalo, you better prepare to be flung around, kupo... Kupohoho～.${prompt}
  13558: |-
    Of course, it wouldn't be too good if you ended up being the one chased either, kupo!

    With all its technology, the Duchy of Jeuno really is an advanced nation.
    I wonder how tall the cranes in Upper Jeuno are.${prompt}
  13819: |-
    Have you ever lit the lamps of Jeuno?
    I once helped illuminate the city all the way from the port to Ru'Lude Gardens!${prompt}
  13820: |-
    Did you know that there are two auction houses in Upper Jeuno?
    Remembering which one is less crowded is nice when you feel like avoiding the crush of people.${prompt}
  13821: |-
    You can find the most amazing things for sale in Ru'Lude Gardens.
    The Mithran flower shop girl definitely keeps her stock fresh!${prompt}
  13822: |-
    Wouldn't heavy rain flood out lower parts of Jeuno?
    An architectural defect like that shouldn't be left unchecked...${prompt}
  13823: |-
    Is that old man over there planning to sit down on that bench or what?
    And they complain about the younger generation being inconsiderate...${prompt}
  13824: |-
    Jeuno is definitely the place for clothes shopping.
    You can't beat Bastok for jewelry, though.${prompt}
  13825: Every time I come here I can't help but think that at least one person must've fallen off the edge...${prompt}
  13826: |-
    Jeuno would be the perfect place with a nice restaurant.
    Maybe I should go into the culinary business.${prompt}

    Apparently, the construction of the cathedral took 120 years to complete.
    A structure like the Chateau d'Oraguille must take centuries.${prompt}
  13831: |-
    Chateau d'Oraguille is so huge, I had to start running around to see everything!
    Luckily a nice guard came and gave me a tour of the Bostaunieux Oubliette.${prompt}
  13832: |-
    If you stand by the fountain, some suspicious character will try to engage you in a game of dice.
    I think he has some kind of gambling problem...${prompt}

    Children in this nation sure have it rough, having to work late into the night and all.

    The furniture stores in San d'Oria have the best selection of goods.
    No surprise with the Carpenters' Guild so close by.${prompt}
  13837: |-
    How embarrassing...
    I stumbled into the lumber stacked outside the Carpenters' Guild and knocked every single one down!${prompt}
  13838: |-
    Bean dishes are wholesome, healthy dishes.
    Blue peas are especially good when you're running low on gil.${prompt}

    Port San d'Oria is built on a lake, right?
    What would happen if the waters rose too high...?${prompt}

    No...?${prompt}

    Bastok is a weird place...${prompt}

    I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother.
    He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...${prompt}

    How could anyone eat fish caught in Bastok's rivers?
    I wish there was a way to tell where fish up for auction are taken from.${prompt}
  13847: I never imagined getting my fashion sense criticized would be such a shattering blow to my self-confidence! Who was that girl anyway...${prompt}
  13848: I never get tired of browsing the jewelry and cosmetic stores in Bastok.${prompt}
  13849: I hope I'm as energetic as that chipper old guy in Bastok Markets when I get to his age...${prompt}
  13850: |-
    I've never eaten a treant bulb before.
    What do they taste like?${prompt}

    Whose job is it to raise the bridge in Port Bastok?
    What if they fall asleep? Will the airship crash into the bridge?${prompt}

    I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother.

  13854: |-
    In Port Windurst, people have opened stores on top of boats in the harbor.
    I wonder if they ever change locations...${prompt}
  13855: |-
    I was walking around town when a huge nut fell out of a tree and bounced off my head.
    You should be careful!${prompt}
  13856: |-
    Windurst truly is a magical nation.
    I was just teleported from Windurst Woods to Windurst Waters in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  13857: |-
    Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.
    The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt}
  13858: |-
    Windurst is virtually governed by the Star Sibyl alone, right?
    Don't the ordinary citizens mind being sidelined from politics?${prompt}
  13859: Tarutaru residences are built to accommodate even the tallest Elvaans. But why build shelves so high up...?${prompt}
  13860: |-
    Windurst is famous for its hat shop.
    I can never visit the city without popping in at least once to check the latest styles.${prompt}
  13861: |-
    The hat shop in Windurst Waters has hoods with little ears attached on display.
    Are they not for sale?${prompt}
  13862: |-
    The restaurant food in Windurst is prepared by the Culinarians' Guild.
    I never miss a chance to indulge in one of their superb dishes.${prompt}
  13863: |-
    There seems to be a lot of water in Windurst.
    What happens if there's a rainstorm and everything floods?
    It wouldn't take much to submerge a wee Tarutaru...${prompt}
  13864: |-
    Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.
    The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt}
  13865: A large building seems to have been embedded inside the Great Star Tree. I wouldn't be surprised if the leg portion of the secret weapon is concealed within.${prompt}
  13866: When I travel to hot areas, my feet always sweat inside my boots. Then the sand gets in there and it drives me crazy...${prompt}
  13867: |-
    I'm ashamed to admit it but...I'm hopeless at riding chocobos.
    I have my license, though. Really.${prompt}
  13868: |-
    Hmm.
    I can't think of anything to talk about.${prompt}
  13869: It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt}
  13870: Because the weather in town is usually either clear or cloudy, there's no need to carry a change of equipment. But since it can be quite unpredictable out in the wilderness, it's good to be prepared.${prompt}
  13871: Just between you and me, I obtained my armor here through unconventional methods.${prompt}
  13872: The other day I had to dash to an outpost to avoid being drenched in a sudden downpour.${prompt}
  13873: Do you ever get the urge to just run around like a mad thing when the ground is covered with snow?${prompt}
  13874: |-
    I do so much prefer to speak with you face to face.
    The pearl can be a little impersonal at times.${prompt}
  13875: |-
    Are moogles considered to be beastmen?
    Is there a moogle king? A god of the moogles?${prompt}
  13876: It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt}
  13877: The other week I went to the Tenshodo to collect a pair of gloves I had ordered, only to discover they were closed for business that day.${prompt}
  13878: |-
    I have to change my shoes as soon as I get home or I can't relax.
    Does anything like that ever happen to you?${prompt}
  13879: |-
    And have you ever worried that the chocobo smell stays with you, even after you dismount?
    Maybe I'm being paranoid...${prompt}
  13880: |-
    ...
    Nope, the only thing that comes to mind is the weather.
    Not very interesting at all.${prompt}
  13881: |-
    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  13882: There's nothing I hate more than getting caught outside without the right gear for the weather.${prompt}
  13883: |-
    The range of goods is pretty good if you buy through this method.
    Unfortunately though, some items aren't always in stock, so you don't always get what you want.${prompt}
  13884: |-
    The guards wouldn't let me inside, if you can believe it!
    My best dress, ruined!${prompt}
  13885: |-
    But if you run around too much, your shoes get all soggy.
    And nobody likes soggy shoes now, do they?${prompt}
  13886: I like to be able to see what you're thinking.${prompt}
  13887: I wonder what kind of pet a moogle god would keep...${prompt}
  13888: |-
    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  13889: Of course, that didn't deter me in the least. I simply seized some of the staff and “persuaded” them to open shop.${prompt}
  13890: No one ever seems to want to swing a huge sword while wearing a tunic or a robe...${prompt}
  13891: I'm hopeless at keeping my room tidy, so I bought some furniture to store all my items.${prompt}
  13892: I went to the Blacksmiths' Guild the other day to have some armor repaired, but it turned out to be their day off.${prompt}
  13893: Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt}
  13894: I've got my eye on some new equipment, but they're way too expensive.${prompt}
  13895: I appreciate your concern for my equipment and all, but what about your own attire?${prompt}
  13896: |-
    Have you ever seen an aurora?
    It looks like a rainbow-colored curtain draped across the sky.${prompt}
  13897: |-
    I never know what to wear on windy days.
    I mean, you can't wear a skirt, right?${prompt}
  13898: |-
    I've noticed that beastmen seem to carry gil around.
    What on Vana'diel do they use it for?${prompt}
  13899: |-
    The smilebringers really exist, you know!
    They live somewhere far to the north!${prompt}
  13900: Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt}
  13901: In the Near East, a race of rat-like beastmen called Qiqirn live alongside common folk. Their information network is said to be impressive.${prompt}
  13902: |-
    I always thought it would look mysterious and unique.
    Maybe I just have no fashion sense...${prompt}
  13903: |-
    For some reason, my Mog House began to feel damp after that.
    Guess I bought too many vases...${prompt}
  13904: |-
    Why does that always happen on the very day you decide to go?
    Call me impatient, but I ended up just buying a new set of armor...${prompt}
  13905: You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt}
  13906: But if I wait a little longer, maybe the price will come down. It's pretty normal for items to become cheaper after a while.${prompt}
  13907: Why, you ask? Is it a crime to want your partner to look cool?${prompt}
  13908: |-
    I've heard they can weave cloth that looks just like it.
    You must be able to make beautiful clothes out of that material...${prompt}
  13909: Not that I ever wear skirts, anyway...${prompt}
  13910: |-
    Do they trade with people?
    I wonder what a beastman would buy...${prompt}
  13911: |-
    They dress in red robes and a red hat, and dance around in white subligaria.
    You believe me, don't you, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13912: You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt}
  13913: |-
    But that reputation doesn't guarantee their information will always be accurate.
    After all, swindling isn't a race-exclusive occupation.${prompt}
  13914: |-
    You're probably thinking that I have a trunk full of armor.
    I actually trade my old gear in all the time.${prompt}
  13915: I've been meaning to tell you, but you shouldn't send me any deliveries.${prompt}
  13916: |-
    There are powerful enemies emerging all around us these days.
    We should keep up our training to avoid being overwhelmed in battle.${prompt}
  13917: |-
    It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls.
    No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.${prompt}
  13918: I've heard stories of people who can fight wyrms on even terms.${prompt}
  13919: You know, I'd love to visit your Mog House one day.${prompt}
  13920: You really feel like chatting today, I see.${prompt}
  13921: Do you eat out much?${prompt}
  13922: J’ai essayé différentes combinaisons d’équipements, mais je n’arrive pas à me décider.${prompt}
  13923: |-
    Que gardes-tu dans ta Maison Mog ?

    Pas besoin de surveiller les environs.${prompt}
  13925: Je passe généralement mon temps libre à entretenir mes armes et à m’entraîner. Et toi, comment passes-tu le tien ?${prompt}
  13926: |-
    J’ai un ami dans le métier, tu vois.
    Je te le présenterai un de ces jours.${prompt}
  13927: Les livreurs semblent me confondre avec un autre aventurier, et je ne reçois pas mon courrier…${prompt}
  13928: |-
    Bien sûr, je serai là pour combattre à tes côtés.
    Pourquoi ne pas s’entraîner ensemble ?${prompt}
  13929: Je suppose qu’on pourrait toujours discuter dans un restaurant ou une Maison Mog, mais je me suis vraiment attaché à notre lieu de rencontre informel.${prompt}
  13930: Pour devenir aussi fort, combien d’heures par jour penses-tu que je devrais passer à monter de niveau ?${prompt}
  13931: |-
    M… ma Maison Mog, tu demandes ? Hors de question !
    C’est un vrai désordre, avec des restes à moitié mangés vieux d’un mois… et bien pire encore !${prompt}
  13932: Eh bien, tu pourrais au moins proposer un sujet de conversation de temps en temps !${prompt}
  13933: |-
    Même si nous faisons autant d’exercice, je commence à prendre du poids si je mange trop de bonne nourriture.
    Ça doit être une question de métabolisme…${prompt}
  13934: |-
    J’ai jusqu’à quatre ensembles différents de prêts…
    Je suppose que les utiliser en combat m’aidera à décider.${prompt}
  13935: |-
    Elle est probablement remplie de pots de fleurs, non ?
    Ou peut-être as-tu un de ces mannequins !${prompt}
  13936: Je suppose qu’on pourrait toujours discuter dans un restaurant ou une Maison Mog, mais je me suis vraiment attaché à notre lieu de rencontre informel.${prompt}

    Hm? Want something?
    You should go talk to a moogle!${prompt}

    Why, hello!

    Hello! You seem to be working very hard. I'm really thankful!
    But you needn't rush around so fast. Take your time! I can wait if it makes the job easier for you!${prompt}
  14303: |-
    Yes? You have a question?
    Oh, I'm sorry. I think you've got the wrong person, but don't worry about it!${prompt}
  14304: |-
    Wow, you brought back a finished chocolate! Thank you so much!
    I wonder what it tastes like. Teeheehee, I can't wait to try it.
    I hope you meet someone special, too!${prompt}

    Aaah!
    Oh...hi! Um, today is...and I...well, that is...

    Well, here goes nothing. I want ${choice: 2}[a cheerful/a cool-headed/an honest/a shy] ${choice: 3}[Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] boyfriend!

    Eep!
    Oh, y-you haven't brought a chocolate back yet? You really scared me, you know!
    Anyway, good luck!${prompt}

    Y-yes? What is it?
    I...um, I don't need anything...${prompt}
  14309: What? Th-this...could it be? You got me a chocolate! I can't eat it here, though...that would be sooo embarrassing. But I will eat it later, so thank you!${prompt}

    Hello...

    I really like ${choice: 2}[cheerful/cool-headed/honest/shy] ${choice: 3}[Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] men.
    Please take this chocolate. It may not be the best in the world, but I hope you can use it to find someone.${prompt}
  14312: |-
    You're not finished with the chocolate yet, are you?
    I knew it would be hard to find someone for a girl like me...${prompt}
  14313: |-
    What's the matter?
    I don't think there's anything I need...${prompt}
  14314: I see you got a chocolate for me. I can't tell how good it will be until I taste it, but maybe there's hope for me after all. Thanks so much for helping me.${prompt}

  14316: |-
    Such blasphemy in our Goddess-blessed nation...
    Is that not a symbol of those heathens?${prompt}
  14317: |-
    The people of Aht Urhgan put their faith in false gods.
    You should be ashamed of yourself.${prompt}
  14318: Yes, I know of the badge you wear.${prompt}
  14319: I was in the port when the Brugaire Consortium was unloading a large shipment of the things.${prompt}
  14320: |-
    I wonder if even the Brugaire Consortium goes too far, sometimes.
    This strange foreign cargo will land them in deep water with the Temple Knights, you mark my words.${prompt}
  14321: Have you heard much about the company distributing those badges?${prompt}
  14322: |-
    Their headquarters are in a Near Eastern town called “Al Zahbi.”
    Rumor has it that the company president is something of a miser.${prompt}
  14323: |-
    What could they possibly want with San d'Oria?
    You may want to think twice before clipping on one of those things.${prompt}
  14324: |-
    The other day I saw a man wandering around town wearing the most unusual clothing.
    Is there some festival I am not aware of?${prompt}
  14325: |-
    How could you possibly not have heard?
    The Near Eastern folk are recruiting soldiers on a massive scale to quell some war that is raging with the beastmen.${prompt}
  14326: |-
    You cannot be serious!
    Do you mean to tell me that another frightful Crystal War once more threatens our fair home?${prompt}
  14327: |-
    There is no need to be so dramatic, Anilla.
    The Near East is not quite so near as to warrant an immediate descent into panic and despair.
    The only people this news pertains to are those action-hungry adventurers.${prompt}
  14328: Speaking of which, I had one of those unruly brutes burst into my home while I was dusting, and proceed to boast about some badge he'd received...${prompt}
  14329: Simply unforgivable. If one must brag of some possession so badly, one should at least observe the common courtesy of knocking...${prompt}
  14330: |-
    Oh my, I thought a shooting star had crossed my vision for a moment there.
    I believe I just made a wish on your badge, ${choice-player-gender}[good sir/madame].${prompt}
  14331: |-
    It comes from the Near East, you say?
    Such a captivating shine it has.
    I wonder if the stars in that nation burn as brightly as they do here? Perhaps I shall go and see for myself...${prompt}
  14332: Come and celebrate the Doll Festival with us, kupo!${prompt}

    We've got items for everyone!
    Here you go, kupo!${prompt}

    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords, kupo!${prompt}
  14338: The villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt}
  14339: |-
    But never fear!
    Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans!
    Behold the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo!${prompt}
  14340: The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt}
  14341: But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!${prompt}

  14346: Would you like to know more, kupo?${prompt}
  14347: |-
    Want to know more?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fill me in!
    I'm okay for now, kupo.${prompt}
  14348: To play Azimuth Circle II, you'll need to team up with a partner and use a compass to search for a specific point.${prompt}
  14349: So your first step is to find that special somebody and form a party!${prompt}
  14350: Then talk to an event moogle, and we'll send you both out of town, kupo!${prompt}
  14351: We've set up several checkpoints outside.${prompt}
  14352: The goal is to find the correct one, kupo!${prompt}
  14353: What's that? You want a hint to help you find your checkpoint? Never fear, kupo--that's where Azima's portable compass comes in!${prompt}
  14354: And it couldn't be easier to use! All the adventurers have to do is sit there and wait!${prompt}
  14355: Once the compass has stabilized, it will give you a hint to help you find your partner's checkpoint, kupo.${prompt}
  14356: But be careful not to relax too much! Just sitting there staring at the clouds won't help you at all, kupo. You have to concentrate the way you do when healing your wounds!${prompt}
  14357: And keep in mind that you will only learn about your partner's checkpoint.${prompt}
  14358: So help each other out and nothing should go wrong!${prompt}
  14359: Once you reach your checkpoint, you should find something buried there that will prove that you made it! You and your partner should trade your items with each other and then hand them to a moogle, kupo!${prompt}
  14360: That's all there is to it, kupo! You'll get a prize if you succeed, so I hope you do well!${prompt}
  14361: You'll need a partner, so come back when you have one!${prompt}
  14362: Three makes a crowd, kupo! I'm looking for parties of two, and no more!${prompt}
  14363: Do you want to go outside and try the event with the person you're in a party with now?${prompt}
  14364: |-
    Is this partner okay with you?
    ${selection-lines}
    Perfect!
    I want to go with someone else...${prompt}
  14365: Come back when you've decided on a partner, kupo!${prompt}
  14366: |-
    Kupo?
    Where'd your partner go?${prompt}
  14367: I hope you enjoy the event together, kupo! When both of you are ready, just talk to one of us moogles to start!${prompt}
  14368: I'll be waiting here, so just let me know when you're prepared, kupo.${prompt}
  14369: |-
    Kupopo! Congratulations!
    You were wonderful together! This is all yours now, kupo...${prompt}
  14370: Kupo? This isn't your partner's item! Trade with your partner first, and give their item to me!${prompt}
  14371: We're just waiting on your partner now, kupo! Or would you like to cancel your participation?${prompt}
  14372: Your partner isn't ready yet, kupo. I'll wait, though.${prompt}
  14373: It looks like your partner doesn't want to go yet. Just let me know when your partner is ready, kupo.${prompt}
  14374: Are you ready now, kupo?${prompt}
  14375: |-
    Leave town?
    ${selection-lines}
    Send me out!
    Not yet...${prompt}
  14376: Oh, you're both wearing yukata! You must be ready for a real challenge, kupo! Don't worry, though--the prize is worth it!${prompt}
  14377: Kupo? That's not the partner you were with before! Changing partners in the middle of the game is against the rules, kupo.${prompt}
  14378: If you want to play with a different person, you should talk to one of us moogles and start the game over!${prompt}
  14379: I can only give each person one item a day!${prompt}
  14380: Later, I'll check to make sure you both found your checkpoints. I'll also give you this gate glyph so you can return to town, kupo!${prompt}
  14381: 'Kupo? You already have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...${prompt}'

  14386: Sorry, but if you don't reach the checkpoint yourself, I can't give out a reward, kupo...${prompt}
  14387: Looks like you weren't successful... Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt}
  14388: Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt}
  14389: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player} returns the compass to the moogle.'
  14390: You know what to do now--get right back on your feet and try again! Just let me know if you're feeling up for it, kupo.${prompt}
  14391: What is it? Do you want to start over?${prompt}
  14392: |-
    Start over?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, please.
    No thanks.${prompt}
  14393: |-
    You there.
    I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of ghosts?${prompt}
  14394: |-
    Have you heard?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ghosts!?
    Yes, I've heard.${prompt}
  14395: Then we may move on to more important matters.${prompt}
  14396: Would you be willing to aid me in exorcising these spirits?${prompt}
  14397: |-
    <Sigh>...
    Allow me to explain.
    I am an exorcist--a banisher of spirits.${prompt}
  14398: I have traveled here at the behest of a certain personage from this nation who is well aware of my skill in such matters.${prompt}
  14399: The request is fairly routine--I am to banish the spirits that have suddenly appeared within the town. But there is a problem...${prompt}
  14400: These ghosts are not simple apparitions.${prompt}
  14401: When they yet lived, they belonged to a witch coven known as the Dark Lilies.${prompt}
  14402: And they use the language of spirits--the Cursed Tongue. It is not a language I am familiar with.${prompt}
  14403: |-
    The art of the exorcist involves learning the mind of the spirit in order to bring it under control.
    I am at the point of capitulation.${prompt}
  14404: That is why I am calling on adventurers to aid me.${prompt}
  14405: I want you to disguise yourself as a monster, and try to eavesdrop on the spirit's mumblings.${prompt}
  14406: Once I learn of these ravings, I will be able to carry out my role as an exorcist.${prompt}
  14407: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt}
  14408: |-
    Ahaha...
    How droll.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  14409: |-
    Most excellent.
    There is one thing you must be aware of, however.${prompt}
  14410: These spirits were once people such as you and I. If they see you directly, there is a good chance they will see through your disguise.${prompt}
  14411: If, by chance, your disguise fails you, simply assume a monstrous form once again and continue your pursuit.${prompt}
  14412: I am aware of two spirits that haunt this town.${prompt}
  14413: The one known as Guwanana is the most alert and suspicious, so I will ask you to first track down the Mithran spirit by the name of Bikho Ronpotteh.${prompt}
  14414: Once you have a clear idea of why the ghost has appeared here, I want you to report your findings to me immediately.${prompt}
  14415: Good luck.${prompt}
  14416: |-
    Is that the glow of success I see upon your face?
    What of the spirit...?${prompt}
  14417: |-
    I see...
    So that is her purpose...${prompt}
  14418: The tale is tragic, but this world is no longer meant for one such as she.${prompt}
  14419: I will prepare for the exorcism.${prompt}
  14420: |-
    You have been a great help.
    Please take this as a token of my appreciation.${prompt}
  14421: |-
    This is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies.
    Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities.
    Enjoy yourself, and forget about this sorrowful affair.${prompt}
  14422: However, should you wish to aid in another exorcism, I would welcome your help.${prompt}
  14423: |-
    What has befallen you?
    Do you wish to give up?${prompt}
  14424: |-
    Give up?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm done.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  14425: |-
    A pity.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  14426: Then please return to your pursuit of the spirits.${prompt}
  14427: |-
    Ah, you're back!
    Perhaps you have enough experience now to stalk the more alert ghost of the two.${prompt}
  14428: Will you consent to aid me again?${prompt}
  14429: |-
    The second spirit is called Guwanana.
    She is well aware of her surroundings, so I urge the utmost care when following her.${prompt}
  14430: |-
    Good day!
    I suppose you've heard of all the ghost sightings around town?${prompt}
  14431: I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.${prompt}
  14432: |-
    I'll get straight to the point.
    Do you want to help in an exorcism?${prompt}
  14433: |-
    Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess.
    Let me give you the short version:${prompt}
  14434: I'm a stranger to this land, called in by one of those important types.${prompt}
  14435: |-
    For what?
    I happen to have a certain level of fame as an exorcist.
    You know--a banisher of spirits.${prompt}
  14436: But these spirits are proving to be a bit of a handful.${prompt}
  14437: They were powerful witches in life and used to belong to some famous coven.${prompt}
  14438: |-
    The worst thing is, they use some beastly language known as the “Cursed Tongue.”
    That's not a language I can understand.${prompt}
  14439: |-
    That's a problem because, as an exorcist, I need to learn what's in their hearts and minds.
    Then I can find a weakness.${prompt}
  14440: That's where you come in...${prompt}
  14441: I need you to disguise yourself as a monster and get close enough to find out what they're thinking.${prompt}
  14442: Once I know some details, I can begin the exorcism and rid this town of its unwelcome guests.${prompt}
  14443: |-
    What do you say?
    Will you help?${prompt}
  14444: |-
    Oh...
    Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  14445: |-
    Thank you!
    There is one thing you should know...${prompt}
  14446: |-
    These ghosts are a little vague, but they were once people too.
    If they get a good look at you, they'll know you're just wearing a costume...${prompt}
  14447: |-
    But don't give up if they catch on to you.
    Just put the disguise back on and try again.${prompt}
  14448: I've located two spirits floating around this town.${prompt}
  14449: |-
    The first one, Pretty Heart, is fairly sharp.
    I suggest you go after Selma, the second spirit, to get your feet wet.${prompt}
  14450: Once you've figured out why the ghost is here, you need to tell me about it right away.${prompt}
  14451: Good luck!${prompt}
  14452: Oho, looks like you've managed to learn something...${prompt}
  14453: |-
    Hmmm...
    So that's why...${prompt}
  14454: |-
    It might seem cruel, but that ghost no longer belongs here.
    The exorcism is for their sake as much as ours...${prompt}
  14455: It's time to begin my preparation.${prompt}
  14456: Oh, and this is for you.${prompt}
  14457: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    The design matches those worn by the coven I mentioned.
    Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.${prompt}
  14458: If you want to try your hand at ghost-chasing again, I'll be right here.${prompt}
  14459: Giving up the ghost?${prompt}
  14460: |-
    Oh...
    Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  14461: Then it's back to chasing spirits with you!${prompt}
  14462: |-
    You know what?
    I think you could probably track that other ghost now that you have some experience.${prompt}
  14463: What do you think?${prompt}
  14464: |-
    Your target's name is Pretty Heart.
    Wonder why he's called that...${prompt}
  14465: |-
    Really?
    I'm pretty sure you've got it in you...${prompt}
  14466: |-
    Hi, I'm Gertrude.
    I came to investigate the rumors of ghosts haunting this town.
    Have you heard anything?${prompt}
  14467: |-
    You have?
    Well, that makes my job easier, then.${prompt}
  14468: Do you think you could help out a struggling exorcist?${prompt}
  14469: |-
    No?
    Then let me fill you in on the details.${prompt}
  14470: I may not appear as such, but I'm actually an exorcist from a land far to the west.${prompt}
  14471: A certain personage from this nation summoned me to banish the spirits plaguing the city.${prompt}
  14472: But once I arrived, I discovered these ghosts were not your average apparitions.${prompt}
  14473: In life, they were fearsome witches and wielded destructive spells of tremendous power.${prompt}
  14474: Their strength has followed them into the afterlife, giving them a high level of resistance to my exorcisms.${prompt}
  14475: In this sort of case, I would usually find some clue from their former lives in order to empower my rituals.${prompt}
  14476: The problem is, these spirits speak the Cursed Tongue, and I can't understand enough of that language to learn anything.${prompt}
  14477: And so, I'm forced to call upon adventurers to aid me.${prompt}
  14478: Would you be willing to disguise yourself as a monster and try to discover what drives these beings?${prompt}
  14479: |-
    Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard.
    Please come back if you change your mind.${prompt}
  14480: |-
    Wonderful.
    There is one thing I must warn you of, however.${prompt}
  14481: These witches were once people, and are clever enough to see through your disguise should you be too careless.${prompt}
  14482: |-
    If they do happen to find you out, please don't give up.
    They will soon forget, and you can don your costume once again.${prompt}
  14483: According to my sources, there are two ghosts in this area.${prompt}
  14484: |-
    The one called Maryse is extremely vigilant and aware of her surroundings.
    I suggest you try following Poseaulloie first to get some practice.${prompt}
  14485: |-
    Once you've discovered the ghost's reason for remaining in this world, please inform me at once.
    There are many preparations to be made.${prompt}
  14486: Good luck!${prompt}
  14487: How did you fare...?${prompt}
  14488: I see, so that's why she...${prompt}
  14489: However, it is my duty to give her that little push she needs to leave this world behind.${prompt}
  14490: I will begin preparing for the exorcism.${prompt}
  14491: |-
    Your help has been invaluable.
    Would you accept this in appreciation?${prompt}
  14492: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...${prompt}
  14493: If you have time, I would gladly accept your help again.${prompt}
  14494: |-
    What's wrong?
    Have you grown tired of your task?${prompt}
  14495: |-
    Oh, I see...
    Well, please return to me if you find your patience for this task restored.${prompt}
  14496: |-
    Then I would ask you to return to your task.
    Good luck.${prompt}
  14497: Would you consider an attempt at following the more wily of the two spirits?${prompt}
  14498: I'm sure you have sufficient experience now.${prompt}
  14499: |-
    Then your next target is the one known as Maryse.

  14590: You located him, but he managed to escape? Well, I guess that is better than nothing. Now that he knows we are on to him, perhaps he will cease to prey on the Kingdom's children.${prompt}

    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!${prompt}

  14619: |-
    But never fear!
    Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]} and the marvelous ${item-singular: 1[2]}, kupo!${prompt}
  14620: The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt}
  14621: But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt}
  14622: |-
    And that's not all!
    This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!${prompt}

  14624: 'That''s why we want you to plant (${color: 5}trade${color: 1}) your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or ${item-singular: 1[2]} into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment''s regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!${prompt}'

  14630: We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!${prompt}

  14683: In other words, he's saying you're always nice to people. You know, helping them out with their problems and stuff. If you're not already a white mage, maybe you should think of a profession change.${prompt}
  14684: Oh, and he also says that the only way that people will ever respect you is if you help them without expecting something in return. Kind of like helping a kid get a New Year's gift without wanting some kind of reward when you're done, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  14685: The dynamic spirit of Ramuh walks by your side.${prompt}
  14686: Just as the world glows with his electric wisdom, your mind too glows with an infinite intelligence that sends shudders of excitement and awe throughout the masses.${prompt}
  14687: In other words, you're a smart ${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady] who is chock full of curiosity and is always looking for a change. You wouldn't happen to be a red mage, would you?${prompt}
  14688: Oh, and he also says that if you would just pay a little more attention to those around you, people might not say all that bad stuff behind your back. Go figure!${prompt}
  14689: The lofty spirit of Titan towers above you.${prompt}
  14690: Just as his adamantine will shields the meager from destitution, you too tread the path of life with caution while providing sanctuary for all souls who gather in the warmth of your heart.${prompt}
  14691: In other words, you think before you act, unlike those creeps who shoot first and ask questions the next Firesday. Your ability to quickly identify an enemy's weak point and finish him off before he hurts your friends makes you good black mage material.${prompt}
  14692: Oh, and he also says that if you were only a little more honest, then people might respect you more than they do that guy at the chocobo stables who sells everybody the gysahl greens with the bugs in 'em.${prompt}
  14693: The whispering spirit of Garuda whisks about you.${prompt}
  14694: Just as the avatar of wind roams free across the never-ending skies of Vana'diel, so too does your lucid heart yearn to break free of the chains that bind it to conformity.${prompt}
  14695: In other words, he's saying that you were born to be an adventurer, and that your free spirit would make you a mighty good thief, if there is such thing as a good thief.${prompt}
  14696: Oh, and he also says that you'd be a lot more popular if you'd stop trying to impress everyone and just be yourself. Go figure!${prompt}
  14697: The lustrous spirit of Leviathan watches over you.${prompt}
  14698: Just as the radiant visage of the guardian of seas renders vapid souls breathless, the pristine balance between your attention to beauty and respect for harmony are the waves upon which your companions cast their vessels.${prompt}
  14699: In other words, that “pristine balance” helps you from being swayed by the poison opinions of others, and grants you good judgment in sticky situations. Add to that all that talk about harmony, and it sounds to me like you'd make a good bard.${prompt}
  14700: Oh, and he also says that if you'd stop worrying about what you wear on the outside and concentrated more on polishing what's inside, people might actually stop avoiding you. Go figure!${prompt}
  14701: The chilling spirit of Shiva shadows your soul.${prompt}
  14702: And just as her veil of hoarfrost hides the world from the eyes of men, you too don a shroud of discretion as you journey alone through the valleys of solitude.${prompt}
  14703: In other words, he's saying that you're a calm, cool, and collected player who has an answer for all the challenges life throws at you. Sounds like blue mage material to me!${prompt}
  14704: Oh, and he also said that if you'd stop picking out people's faults and concentrate on what they've got on the inside, maybe you'll learn what true friendship is. Ouch!${prompt}
  14705: The searing spirit of Ifrit walks alongside you.${prompt}
  14706: Just as the inferno within his soul spits forth flames of undying emotion, the fire deep in your heart burns with the passion and determination to face any challenge.${prompt}
  14707: In other words, once you've set your mind on something, a bucket full of pamama au lait ain't gonna stop you from charging in the room and unloading your quiver of bloody bolts on anything that stands in your way. Sounds like a grade-A warrior to me.${prompt}
  14708: Oh, and he also said that if you would start being a little more decisive, people would stop refusing to be in your party because they thought it was going to take you three days to decide on a place to camp lesser colibri. Go figure!${prompt}
  14709: The daunting spirit of Odin stands alert at your side.${prompt}
  14710: Just as the mighty conqueror's ambition drives him to Victory's bosom, so too does the harmony within your heart guide stray souls to the paths they seek.${prompt}
  14711: In other words, he's saying that your belief in your faith, along with your hating of all that is wrong, keeps your heart pure--pure enough to endure the trials of a paladin.${prompt}
  14712: Oh, and he also says that you're actually really sensitive, but too ashamed to show people your true feelings, so you pent them all up inside. You'd better fix that or you'll find yourself battling some nasty ulcers. Cheers!${prompt}
  14713: The noble spirit of Fenrir guards your shadows.${prompt}
  14714: Just as the guardian of the moon's light drives darkness from the kingdom of night, you follow the sun across land and sky, from dawn until dusk, from birth until death. You see the world on a scale that dwarfs even the mightiest of mountains and their snow-laden peaks.${prompt}
  14715: In other words, he's saying that you're always in search of a good time, and are always up to speed with the latest fads and fashions. Maybe you should think about being a corsair or a puppetmaster. Come on! Everyone's doing it!${prompt}
  14716: Oh, and he also said that your refusal to act normal every now and then freaks a lot of people out. Keep that in mind before you go running down to the auction house wearing only your subligar.${prompt}
  14717: The mighty spirit of Bahamut hovers above you.${prompt}
  14718: Just as the Wyrmking rules the skies with his mere presence, so too do you stand above lesser men with your distinct aura of fortune and conviction.${prompt}
  14719: In other words, he's saying that by combining the logic and ideals that clutter your brain with a little of the luck that saves your lazy bum all the time, you'd have the power to summon great power...like a summoner!${prompt}
  14720: Oh, and he also says that if you'd stop trying so hard and rely a little more on the smiles that Fortune keeps wafting your way, people might actually think you're competent. Go figure!${prompt}

  14958: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  14959: “Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt}
  14960: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  14961: “Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt}
  14962: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  14963: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  14964: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  14965: “Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt}
  14966: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  14967: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}
  14968: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt}

  14975: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt}
  14976: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt}
  14977: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt}
  14978: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt}
  14979: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  14980: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  14981: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  14982: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  14983: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  14984: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  14985: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  14986: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.${prompt}
  14987: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  14988: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}
  14989: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.${prompt}
  14990: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  14991: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  14992: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  14993: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  14994: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  14995: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.${prompt}
  14996: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}
  14997: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.${prompt}
  14998: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!${prompt}
  14999: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}
  15000: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.${prompt}
  15001: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.${prompt}
  15002: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.${prompt}

  15023: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  15024: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  15025: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}

  15036: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  15037: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  15038: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'
  15039: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt}
  15040: 'The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt}'
  15041: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  15042: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo''s energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt}'
  15043: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt}'
  15044: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt}
  15045: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}
  15046: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt}

    Which would you like to ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Abilities.
    Temperament.
    Weather preferences.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  15049: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  15050: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  15051: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  15052: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  15053: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  15054: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  15055: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  15056: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  15057: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  15058: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}
  15059: 'When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  15060: 'You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  15061: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt}
  15062: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt}
  15063: 'You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}'
  15064: 'You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  15065: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt}
  15066: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  15067: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  15068: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt}
  15069: 'When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  15070: 'Also, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}''s power will grow weak after you''ve used it several times.${prompt}'

  15074: With this card, you can register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field or get a chococard for matchmaking.${prompt}
  15075: If you lose it, you won't be able to get another one, so keep it in a safe place!${prompt}
  15076: 'You can use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.${prompt}'
  15077: The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.${prompt}
  15078: 'Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, so good luck with that...${prompt}'
  15079: Chococards are documents that contain all the details about a chocobo's attributes and condition. They are divided into two types--one for each gender.${prompt}
  15080: If you trade one to the person who's in charge of matchmaking, he'll introduce your animal to another chocobo.${prompt}
  15081: Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.${prompt}

  16093: Do you not agree? Surely you would not have the nerve to suggest that your chocobo is...dare I say...better than ours?${prompt}

    Quit.
    Return.${prompt}
  16203: |-
    Why not!?
    Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt}
  16204: We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt}
  16205: However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt}
  16206: The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt}
  16207: And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt}
  16208: Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt}
  16209: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  16210: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  16211: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  16212: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  16213: Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt}
  16214: Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt}
  16215: In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
  16216: Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt}
  16217: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  16218: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  16219: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  16220: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  16221: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  16222: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  16223: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  16224: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  16225: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt}'
  16226: You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt}
  16227: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  16228: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  16229: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  16230: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  16231: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  16232: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  16233: 'Ah, it says here that you are a member of the ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt}'

  16235: 'Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?${prompt}'

  16519: Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt}
  16520: The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt}
  16521: The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt}
  16522: The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt}
  16523: In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt}
  16524: Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt}
  16525: Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt}
  16526: For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt}
  16527: We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt}
  16528: No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt}
  16529: Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt}
  16530: As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt}
  16531: Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  16532: Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt}
  16533: Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt}
  16534: The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt}
  16535: As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt}
  16536: Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  16537: We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt}
  16538: Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt}
  16539: Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt}
  16540: Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt}

    Signing up for another race.
    I'm fine, thanks.${prompt}
  16542: There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt}
  16543: First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt}
  16544: Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt}
  16545: Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt}
  16546: All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt}
  16547: A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt}
  16548: Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt}
  16549: There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt}
  16550: There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt}
  16551: 'Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt}'
  16552: 'In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt}'
  16553: The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt}
  16554: You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt}
  16555: 'To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt}'
  16556: The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt}
  16557: You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt}
  16558: After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt}
  16559: This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt}
  16560: We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt}

    What would you like to ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is chocobetting?
    How do I bet?
    What are odds?
    When do I bet?
    How do I collect winnings?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  16562: Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt}
  16563: To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt}
  16564: Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt}
  16565: For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt}
  16566: And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt}
  16567: Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt}
  16568: The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt}
  16569: 'To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt}'
  16570: 'For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt}'
  16571: We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt}
  16572: Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt}
  16573: Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt}
  16574: It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt}
  16575: What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt}
  16576: 'Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt}'
  16577: The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt}
  16578: Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt}
  16579: Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt}
  16580: Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt}
  16581: 'Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt}'
  16582: 'Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  16583: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt}'
  16584: Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.${prompt}

  16647: With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt}
  16648: As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt}
  16649: “The Monster Races”!${prompt}
  16650: Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt}
  16651: |-
    Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.
    What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt}
  16652: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  16653: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  16654: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  16655: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  16656: Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt}
  16657: |-
    The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.
    It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt}
  16658: |-
    Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.
    If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt}
  16659: |-
    Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.
    Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt}
  16660: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  16661: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  16662: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  16663: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  16664: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  16665: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  16666: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  16667: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  16668: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo''s performance.${prompt}'
  16669: |-
    You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.
    Thank you for your understanding.${prompt}
  16670: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  16671: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  16672: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  16673: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  16674: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  16675: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  16676: Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt}
  16677: |-
    We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.
    The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt}
  16678: |-
    Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.
    And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt}
  16679: |-
    As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.
    It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.
    Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  16680: |-
    In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.
    Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.
    It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt}
  16681: |-
    Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.
    These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt}

  16744: '...and her faithful servant/translator, Markovich.${prompt}'
  16745: Good day, fol--${prompt}
  16746: ピヨ！${prompt}
  16747: Sakura says that she loves you all from the bottom of her tiny heart.${prompt}
  16748: 'Alrighty then, our next race features ${number: 0} of Vana''diel''s top chocobos. Let us start off by introducing the birds and their jockeys.${prompt}'
  16749: 'First we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, who will be ridden by ${choice: 1}[the ace of the chase, Ignazio/three-time chocobo racing all★star, Eudocia/the bloody emperor, Roinolier/the empress of speed, Maurette/Lami-Baami Suave Esquire III/the red rose of racing, Sosopapa/CRA legend, Khowa Mathgalhi/rising CRA star, Bayansh].${prompt}'
  16750: ピヨピヨ！${prompt}
  16751: She says, “When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.”${prompt}
  16752: She says, “And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' all☆star!“${prompt}
  16753: She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt}
  16754: She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt}
  16755: She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt}
  16756: She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt}
  16757: She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt}
  16758: She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt}
  16759: 'Next we have ${choice: 0}[Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by ${choice: 0}[the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].${prompt}'
  16760: Sakura says, “Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!”${prompt}
  16761: Sakura says, “This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.”${prompt}
  16762: Sakura says, “Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.”${prompt}
  16763: 'Our next chocobo is ${choice: 0}[Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by ${choice: 0}[Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura''s number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].${prompt}'
  16764: Sakura says, “Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.”${prompt}
  16765: Sakura says, ”She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.”${prompt}
  16766: ピヨ～♪${prompt}
  16767: Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...${prompt}
  16768: 'The next contestant is ${choice: 0}[Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by ${choice: 0}[chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].${prompt}'
  16769: She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.${prompt}
  16770: She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.${prompt}
  16771: She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.${prompt}
  16772: And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.${prompt}
  16773: And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?${prompt}
  16774: The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.${prompt}
  16775: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.
  16776: And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...
  16777: '...and her obedient interpreter, everyone''s favorite lover of animals, Markovich!'

  16784: Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
  16785: I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.${prompt}
  16786: Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!${prompt}
  16787: |-
    Yeah...
    Good luck, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  16788: Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.${prompt}
  16789: 'And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt}'
  16790: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt}
  16791: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt}
  16792: Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt}
  16793: They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt}
  16794: Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt}
  16795: Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt}
  16796: As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt}
  16797: ${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt}
  16798: Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt}
  16799: Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt}
  16800: 'And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt}'
  16801: ピヨッ！${prompt}
  16802: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt}
  16803: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt}
  16804: Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt}
  16805: Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt}
  16806: a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt}
  16807: This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt}
  16808: Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  16809: It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt}
  16810: We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt}
  16811: Well, there you have it.${prompt}
  16812: Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt}

  16816: Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt}
  16817: Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  16818: Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt}
  16819: The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt}
  16820: Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt}
  16821: So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt}
  16822: Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt}
  16823: Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt}
  16824: My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt}
  16825: '${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt}'
  16826: We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt}
  16827: Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt}
  16828: Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt}
  16829: What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt}
  16830: Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt}
  16831: Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt}
  16832: Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt}
  16833: Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt}
  16834: Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt}
  16835: 'And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d''Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d''Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt}'
  16836: Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt}
  16837: Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt}
  16838: Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt}
  16839: The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt}
  16840: When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt}
  16841: When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt}
  16842: And they're off!
  16843: Markovich, what did you think of the start?
  16844: Well, I fel--
  16845: ピヨピヨッ！
  16846: Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
  16847: Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  16848: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  16849: And as they pass the halfway mark...
  16850: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} holds on to the lead!'
  16851: '${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!'
  16852: 'While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  16853: 'While from behind, #${number: 2} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  16854: 'All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!'
  16855: Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
  16856: And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
  16857: ピヨピヨ！
  16858: Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”
  16859: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  16860: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  16861: 'Incredible! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed is approaching dangerous limits!'
  16862: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!'
  16863: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  16864: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed has begun to drop off!'
  16865: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has begun to tire!'
  16866: The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  16867: The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  16868: The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
  16869: The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
  16870: 'The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  16871: 'Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  16872: 'And yet ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems completely unaffected by the attack!'
  16873: And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  16874: And now they're approaching the final corner!
  16875: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  16876: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  16877: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  16878: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!'
  16879: The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  16880: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  16881: 'And ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} takes the crown!'
  16882: 'What''s this? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  16883: 'And it''s ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} by a beak!!!'
  16884: Let's take a look at the results...${prompt}
  16885: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})${prompt}'
  16886: There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt}
  16887: Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt}
  16888: Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt}
  16889: Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt}
  16890: |-
    What an amazing race!
    The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt}
  16891: 'What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird''s performance?${prompt}'
  16892: '${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt}'
  16893: The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt}
  16894: Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt}
  16895: Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt}
  16896: Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt}
  16897: The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt}
  16898: |-
    And there you have it.
    This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt}
  16899: And now, let's see the results from the last race.
  16900: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})'
  16901: And that's all she wrote, folks!
  16902: 'The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!'
  16903: Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
  16904: She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
  16905: She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
  16906: Until next time, race fans...
  16907: Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt}
  16908: 'Taking the crown for today''s race was none other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  16909: 'To the winning steed''s owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt}'
  16910: 'And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  16911: Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt}
  16912: |-
    Excellent race, ${name-player}!
    You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt}
  16913: Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt}
  16914: Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt}
  16915: But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt}

  16930: |-
    Oh...?
    Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?${prompt}
  16931: I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt}
  16932: |-
    Is that so...?
    Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt}
  16933: |-
    Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.
    You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt}
  16934: Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt}
  16935: Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt}
  16936: |-
    But of course! I had forgotten all about it!
    Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!
    Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt}
  16937: |-
    But that's not where it ends!
    There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt}
  16938: |-
    A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.
    Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt}
  16939: It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt}
  16940: |-
    Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!
    But...${prompt}
  16941: But...?${prompt}
  16942: I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt}
  16943: |-
    I see...
    Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt}
  16944: |-
    You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.
    Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt}
  16945: |-
    But enough talking, I say.
    It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt}
  16946: |-
    Oh, yes, right...
    Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!
    It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt}
  16947: 'In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt}'
  16948: |-
    Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?
    I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt}
  16949: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don''t let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep''s clothing”!${prompt}'
  16950: I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt}
  16951: I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt}
  16952: Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt}
  16953: Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt}
  16954: With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt}
  16955: |-
    Whoopee!
    Bring them on, I say!${prompt}
  16956: |-
    Erm...yes...
    Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt}
  16957: Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt}
  16958: |-
    Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!
    Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt}
  16959: |-
    Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.
    I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt}
  16960: And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt}
  16961: |-
    My, oh my...!
    I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt}
  16962: |-
    A-ahem!
    I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt}
  16963: |-
    All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!
    Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt}
  16964: |-
    It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...
    <Sniffle>${prompt}
  16965: |-
    Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    ...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  16966: |-
    Hrmmm...
    Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt}
  16967: Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt}
  16968: |-
    What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!
    There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt}
  16969: Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt}
  16970: |-
    And won't you look at the lineup!
    This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?
    I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt}
  16971: And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt}
  16972: |-
    Huh?
    Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt}
  16973: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt}
  16974: |-
    <Gulp>
    You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt}
  16975: '...Professor Shantotto!${prompt}'
  16976: |-
    If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,
    as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt}
  16977: |-
    Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,
    four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt}
  16978: |-
    So if you care to hear out my little proposal,
    these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt}
  16979: |-
    With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...
    Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt}
  16980: |-
    With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?
    Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt}
  16981: First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt}
  16982: |-
    Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.
    I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt}
  16983: Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt}
  16984: |-
    Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”
    Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt}
  16985: Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt}
  16986: |-
    Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.
    If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt}
  16987: Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt}
  16988: |-
    For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.
    Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt}
  16989: |-
    Um...Professor Shantotto...
    Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt}
  16990: |-
    Ohohohohoho!
    Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.
    But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt}
  16991: |-
    Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.
    Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt}
  16992: |-
    Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.
    So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt}
  16993: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--
    that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt}
  16994: |-
    The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.
    But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt}
  16995: |-
    H-hey!
    What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt}
  16996: |-
    My, my, what a pleasant surprise!
    I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt}
  16997: |-
    How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!
    This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt}
  16998: |-
    Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.
    I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt}
  16999: |-
    And you, Goccilo!
    What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt}
  17000: |-
    Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!
    Until next time...!${prompt}
  17001: ${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt}
  17002: |-
    What's with the baffled expression?
    It's me, Sakura.${prompt}
  17003: |-
    You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.
    I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt}
  17004: I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt}
  17005: I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt}
  17006: And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt}
  17007: I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt}
  17008: Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt}
  17009: I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  17010: I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  17011: |-
    And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    But something seems to be different...
    Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt}
  17012: She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt}
  17013: The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt}
  17014: |-
    I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!
    A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt}
  17015: And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt}
  17016: It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt}
  17017: |-
    And that completes the lineup, folks.
    With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt}
  17018: 'You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  17019: Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  17020: I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt}
  17021: I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt}
  17022: I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt}
  17023: |-
    But no more...
    If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt}
  17024: This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt}
  17025: I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  17026: Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt}
  17027: Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  17028: I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt}
  17029: Next, we have Sakura...${prompt}
  17030: |-
    Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
    This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt}
  17031: |-
    Well I'll be...
    In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt}
  17032: '...${prompt}'
  17033: |-
    Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.
    For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt}
  17034: '${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt}'
  17035: |-
    Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!
    Congratulations!${prompt}
  17036: |-
    Great race, ${name-player}.
    It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt}
  17037: |-
    But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..
    With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt}
  17038: |-
    Princess...
    Princess Sakura!${prompt}
  17039: |-
    Princess...?
    What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt}
  17040: |-
    Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.
    I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt}
  17041: Searching for...me?${prompt}
  17042: |-
    Yes, Your Highness.
    You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt}
  17043: |-
    Are you serious!?
    Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt}
  17044: |-
    That is correct.
    Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt}
  17045: D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt}
  17046: |-
    ...!
    I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt}
  17047: Wh...what happened?${prompt}
  17048: |-
    You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.
    You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt}
  17049: She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt}
  17050: |-
    Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.
    But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt}
  17051: My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt}
  17052: So that's what happened...${prompt}
  17053: Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt}
  17054: '...${prompt}'
  17055: I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt}
  17056: |-
    Your Highness!
    But...why!?${prompt}
  17057: Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt}
  17058: What's more...${prompt}
  17059: I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt}
  17060: I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt}
  17061: What...?${prompt}
  17062: The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt}
  17063: |-
    And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?
    I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt}
  17064: I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt}
  17065: |-
    Heehee!
    Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt}
  17066: |-
    ${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!
    Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt}
  17067: You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  17068: Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt}
  17069: |-
    What?
    How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt}
  17070: |-
    Hohoho...
    It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt}
  17071: I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt}
  17072: |-
    Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?
    No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt}
  17073: Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt}
  17074: |-
    <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.
    But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt}
  17075: |-
    You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.
    To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt}
  17076: |-
    And you, our new Chocochampion!
    Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt}
  17077: |-
    Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.
    These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt}
  17078: And they're off!
  17079: |-
    Hrmmm!
    ${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
  17080: Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
  17081: |-
    All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.
    But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
  17082: Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  17083: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  17084: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  17085: The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  17086: The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
  17087: And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  17088: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  17089: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!'
  17090: The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  17091: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!'
  17092: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  17093: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  17094: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  17095: 'What''s this? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  17096: '${number: 1}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}${prompt}'
  17097: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!'
  17098: 'Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!'
  17099: |-
    ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!
    And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
  17100: "I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s step. \nAnd the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!"
  17101: |-
    And here's some unexpected drama, folks!
    The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
  17102: 'Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!'
  17103: |-
    Uh-oh, what's going on here!?
    The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
  17104: 'Oooh! In a bold move, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!'
  17105: |-
    What's this!?
    All of the chocobos other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
  17106: |-
    Thanks to that brazen little act, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!
    That just might seal the deal for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!
  17107: |-
    Never in all my days, race fans!
    In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
  17108: |-
    How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?
    In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
  17109: Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
  17110: The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
  17111: The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
  17112: The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
  17113: |-
    Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?
    What in the world do you think you're doing!?
  17114: |-
    Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.
    This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
  17115: |-
    What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?
    I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.
    This could get heavy, folks!
  17116: |-
    All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.
    Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
  17117: It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
  17118: |-
    There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!
    More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
  17119: And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
  17120: |-
    The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.
    This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
  17121: |-
    This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.
    Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
  17122: |-
    And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!
    Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
  17123: |-
    And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!
    But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
  17124: |-
    I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!
    Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
  17125: |-
    It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!
    The time for a final spurt is now or never!
  17126: And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
  17127: |-
    You see a single, ivory ${color: 5}venture roll${color: 1} die on the table.
    There are currently ${number: 0}/${number: 1} other players wishing to participate.${prompt}

    What would you like to do?

    Join table (${number: 2} gil).
    Leave.

  17129: 'There are currently ${number: 0}/${number: 8} players at the table. Please wait a moment until the remaining participants have arrived. (You may still leave the table at any time.)'

    Double up? (Currently: ${number: 0})
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  17134: |-
    ${name-player} doubles up...
    Your ${color: 5}venture roll${color: 1} total is now ${number: 0}!
  17135: |-
    ${name-player} doubles up...
    BUST!!!

  17142: 'The winner is ${entity: 0}!${prompt}'
  17143: Someone has dropped the die down the drain! You can no longer continue playing.${prompt}
  17144: The final place at the table has already been taken.${prompt}
  17145: You do not have enough gil.${prompt}
  17146: Someone has dropped the die!${prompt}

    Read which chapter?
    ${selection-lines}
    1. “The Heart of Venture Roll.”
    2. “Rules of the Roll.”
    3. “Putting the Book Down.”${prompt}
  17148: Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.${prompt}
  17149: 'Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (${color: 5}doubling up${color: 1}) as many times as the table time limit allows (${number: 8} ${choice-plurality: 8}[minute/minutes], Earth time).${prompt}'
  17150: 'In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (${color: 5}hold fast${color: 1}).${prompt}'
  17151: If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.${prompt}
  17152: Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).${prompt}
  17153: 'Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.${prompt}'
  17154: 'If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a ${color: 5}draw${color: 1} and all participation fees are repaid in full.${prompt}'
  17155: Once the game has started, fees will not be refunded for any reason unless the match results in a draw.${prompt}
  17156: |-
    It's here! It's here!
    The season of Celestial Nights is upon us! And to celebrate, the moogles are bringing together lost loves by offering free teleportation to San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst!${prompt}
  17157: If there's someone you've been longing to see, just let me know and I'll warp you right to their side (provided they are in either San d'Oria, Bastok, or Windurst), kupo!${prompt}
  17158: |-
    Where would you like to go?

    Nowhere.
    San d'Oria.
    Bastok.
    Windurst.${prompt}
  17159: See you again, kupo!${prompt}
  17160: Oh, that's right! I almost forgot to give you this, kupo!${prompt}
  17161: Are you ready for another spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?${prompt}
  17162: |-
    We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.
    Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!${prompt}
  17163: |-
    Oh, a new adventurer!
    Best of luck, kupo!${prompt}
  17164: |-
    Are you helping out the new adventurers?
    Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!${prompt}
  17165: Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!${prompt}
  17166: |-
    The face in the portrait you brought me is just...
    Kupupupu!${prompt}
  17167: |-
    You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?
    Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt}
  17168: This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt}
  17169: |-
    To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.
    Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt}
  17170: |-
    This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.
    Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt}
  17171: |-
    Please come back with a different partner.
    It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt}
  17172: |-
    Your partner isn't ready to go.
    Please wait a little longer, kupo.${prompt}
  17173: |-
    Your partner must talk to me as well.
    I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt}
  17174: |-
    You can only choose one partner a day.
    Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt}
  17175: |-
    Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!
    You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt}
  17176: Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt}
  17177: Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt}
  17178: |-
    Are you ready to go?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ready, kupo!
    I'm too terrified, kupo!${prompt}
  17179: |-
    I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal.
    You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.${prompt}
  17180: |-
    If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!
    Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt}
  17181: 'You can only carry one ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  17182: Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?${prompt}
  17183: |-
    Hey, you changed partners!
    You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt}
  17184: |-
    Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!
    You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt}
  17185: |-
    Choose your partner wisely.
    Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!${prompt}
  17186: |-
    You there.
    I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of part-time ghosts?${prompt}
  17187: |-
    Have you heard?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I've heard.
    Part-time ghosts!?${prompt}
  17188: Then we may move on to more important matters.${prompt}
  17189: We haven't been able to locate enough volunteers to participate in this year's festivities, and are searching for adventurers who would be willing to aid us.${prompt}
  17190: All you will be required to do is dress up in one of these frightening costumes and wander about the city with the other specters.${prompt}
  17191: |-
    <Sigh>...
    Then allow me to explain.${prompt}
  17192: A memorial is currently being held in honor of a long-lost coven of witches known as the Dark Lilies.${prompt}
  17193: During the memorial, volunteers dressed up as the witches and spirits walk a course about the city in honor of the deceased.${prompt}
  17194: However, while we have filled all the spots for the witches, we are quite short on people willing to play the part of the monsters who follow the Lilies.${prompt}
  17195: Would you be willing to lend a hand, fine ${choice-player-gender}[sir/lady]?${prompt}
  17196: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt}
  17197: |-
    Ah... How droll.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  17198: |-
    Most excellent.
    There is one thing you must be aware of, however.${prompt}
  17199: The witches have the most important role in this memorial service. You are to tread only in their wake. If it is found that you have stepped ahead of one of the Lilies, you will be asked to return your costume and leave the procession.${prompt}
  17200: Though, we are a forgiving organization, and if you wish to participate once again, either speak with me or simply put on another costume and your request shall be granted.${prompt}
  17201: Ah yes, and one more thing. There are two citizens playing the parts of the witches Guwanana and Bikho Ronpotteh.${prompt}
  17202: You are to follow the fair Mithran maid dressed as Bikho. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.${prompt}
  17203: Ah, welcome back, adventurer. You have done well. The Dark Lilies would be pleased.${prompt}
  17204: Please take this as a token of our appreciation.${prompt}
  17205: It is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies. Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities.${prompt}
  17206: Oh, and should you wish to aid us again, we would welcome your help. Many thanks, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  17207: |-
    What has befallen you?
    Do you wish to give up?${prompt}
  17208: |-
    Give up?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm done.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  17209: |-
    A pity.
    Please speak with me again if you change your mind.${prompt}
  17210: You are to follow the young maiden dressed as Guwanana. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.${prompt}
  17211: |-
    Good day!
    I suppose you've heard of all the people signing up to play ghosts in this year's festival, nay?${prompt}
  17212: |-
    Have you heard?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I've heard.
    Play ghosts!?${prompt}
  17213: I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.${prompt}
  17214: |-
    I'll get straight to the point, then.
    We need volunteers to dress up as ghosts, specters, wights, and the like, and walk around the city in honor of the Dark Lilies.${prompt}
  17215: Would you be willing to participate? You will be rewarded nicely!${prompt}
  17216: |-
    Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess.
    Let me give you the short version:${prompt}
  17217: We're putting on a grand parade for this season's Harvest Festival.${prompt}
  17218: We already have enough people to play the witches, but there can never be enough monsters, nay?${prompt}
  17219: That's why we need volunteers like you to make the parade even more exciting. Oh, worry not, adventurer. You will be rewarded nicely!${prompt}
  17220: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Not a ghost of a chance.${prompt}
  17221: |-
    Oh...
    Well, acting isn't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  17222: |-
    Thank you!
    Now, there is one thing you should know...${prompt}
  17223: The witches lead the procession. If you start getting any delusions of grandeur and work your way in front of the Lilies, you will be required to turn over your costume and forfeit all payment for services up to that point.${prompt}
  17224: But that doesn't mean you can't try again! Just put on another costume and get back in line. I'm sure you'll get the hang of things soon enough.${prompt}
  17225: 'Oh, and one more thing. There are two witches in this season''s parade: Selma and Pretty Heart.${prompt}'
  17226: You're to be stationed in Selma's parade, so don't go wandering over to Pretty Heart's, hear me?${prompt}
  17227: Good luck!${prompt}
  17228: Excellent job, ${name-player}! You've done the witches proud.${prompt}
  17229: Here's the reward I promised.${prompt}
  17230: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    The design matches those worn by the Dark Lilies. Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.${prompt}
  17231: Though, if you want to volunteer again, I'll be right here waiting for you!${prompt}
  17232: Giving up the ghost, eh?${prompt}
  17233: |-
    Oh...
    Well, acting isn't everybody's cup of tea.
    I'll be here if you change your mind.${prompt}
  17234: You're to be stationed in Pretty Heart's parade, so don't go wandering over to Selma's, hear me?${prompt}
  17235: |-
    Hi, I'm Gertrude.
    I'm helping with some of the Harvest Festival activities. Have you heard about our hiring policies?${prompt}
  17236: |-
    Heard about them?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not at all.${prompt}
  17237: |-
    You have?
    Well, that makes my job easier, then.${prompt}
  17238: So, would you like to sign up for the Procession of the Lilies?${prompt}
  17239: |-
    No?
    Then let me fill you in on the details. We are currently holding a memorial for the Dark Lilies, in which two women dressed as members of the lost coven lead a party of spirits around the city.${prompt}
  17240: There is a shortage of volunteers for the witches' undead followers, and I was wondering if you would like to help.${prompt}
  17241: |-
    Sign up?
    ${selection-lines}
    Right away!
    Not today.${prompt}
  17242: |-
    Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard.
    Please come back if you change your mind.${prompt}
  17243: |-
    Wonderful.
    There are just two more things I must warn you of, however.${prompt}
  17244: First and foremost, during the procession, the witches are boss, so don't even think of stepping in front of them. If you do, your costume will be immediately confiscated.${prompt}
  17245: Ah, but if that happens, you need not worry. Just put on another costume and try again!${prompt}
  17246: Secondly, there are two witches in the city--Maryse and Poseaulloie.${prompt}
  17247: You are to join with Poseaulloie's congregation.${prompt}
  17248: Good luck!${prompt}
  17249: How did you fare...? Was the witch pleased?${prompt}
  17250: |-
    Either way, your help has been invaluable.
    Would you accept this in appreciation?${prompt}
  17251: |-
    It's a witch hat.
    Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...${prompt}
  17252: Though, if you have time, we would gladly accept your help again.${prompt}
  17253: |-
    What's wrong?
    Have you grown tired of your duties?${prompt}
  17254: |-
    Oh, I see...
    Well, please return to me if you find your patience for them restored.${prompt}
  17255: You are to join with Maryse's congregation.${prompt}
  17256: I shall let you know when there is another opening.${prompt}
  17257: I'll let you know when a spot opens up.${prompt}
  17258: You'll be the first to know when I have a new opening.${prompt}
  17259: Ooops! You've stepped in front of the witch!${prompt}
  17260: You can't stop now. You've just started!${prompt}
  17261: You've only just begun.${prompt}
  17262: There's still a long way to go.${prompt}
  17263: Hope you didn't make any other plans, because you're not even close to being finished.${prompt}
  17264: Almost halfway...${prompt}
  17265: It's still a little too early to go back.${prompt}
  17266: Leave the procession now and someone might be peeved.${prompt}
  17267: Just a little longer...${prompt}
  17268: You're almost done!${prompt}
  17269: Alright! It's time to collect your reward!${prompt}
  17270: You've joined the procession.${prompt}
  17271: Adventurer! Adventurer!${prompt}
  17272: |-
    Might you lend a poor Moogle a hand?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure!
    Doing what?
    Not today.${prompt}
  17273: |-
    A thousand thanks, kupo!
    Your participation in the Neo Crystal War will benefit your nation in ways beyond imagination!${prompt}
  17274: |-
    Rules? Why, they are simple, my friend!
    All you need do is sneak your way into beastman lairs and retrieve shards from the ${color: 5}cyclopean crystals${color: 1} located about the strongholds, kupo!${prompt}
  17275: Which lairs? Must I tell you everything, adventurer? Moogle intelligence reports that the crystals can be found in the Ghelsba Outpost, Davoi, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja. Now what are you waiting for, kupo!?${prompt}
  17276: You see, recently there has been much unrest amongst our many Moogle factions, kupo.${prompt}
  17277: Why, you ask? Well, at one of our gatherings, an argument broke out regarding the Crystal War 20 years gone.${prompt}
  17278: 'It all started with the question: which nation played the biggest role in the allied forces'' victory over the beastmen armies?${prompt}'
  17279: And from there things degraded into a shouting match pitting San d'Oria versus Bastok versus Windurst, kupo...${prompt}
  17280: However, at the end of the day, no one could present hard evidence to the claim of their nation's greatness.${prompt}
  17281: And that is when one of our elders came up with a foolproof method to put an end to our doubts--we would have adventurers from all three nations fight the war again, kupo!${prompt}
  17282: By fighting, I don't mean fighting each other, but fighting the beastmen like our fathers did 20 years ago!${prompt}
  17283: One of the ways the allied armies were able to defeat the enemy was by intercepting and cutting off the Shadow Lord's crystal supply routes.${prompt}
  17284: We want you and other adventurers from across Vana'diel to take on the roles of allied solders and infiltrate beastman strongholds, kupo.${prompt}
  17285: Once inside, you are to locate large formations where the beastmen have been storing crystals over the past two decades...${prompt}
  17286: '...and break off as many shards as possible, then bring them back here, kupo.${prompt}'
  17287: The nation that brings back the most shards will be declared the Crystal War's “Most Valuable Nation” and the Moogles' squabbles will finally come to an end.${prompt}
  17288: |-
    So, what do you say, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm in.
    Maybe later.${prompt}
  17289: Kupopo... Did I mention that there will be wondrous prizes to adventurers from the victorious nation? Oh well, if you have a change of heart, you'll know where to find me!${prompt}
  17290: Kupopo...${prompt}
  17291: Welcome back, adventurer! Let me see how many shards you have retrieved, kupo...${prompt}
  17292: 'My records show that you have brought your nation a total of ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[shard/shards], but I know you''re not done yet, are you?${prompt}'
  17293: 'Amazing! You''ve already collected ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[shard/shards], kupo! I think I have something extra special for you!${prompt}'
  17294: Here's a little something to keep you motivated, kupo!${prompt}

  17296: 'Congratulations on your victory, ${choice: 0}[San d''Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian]! Your nation has been selected Crystal War MVN, kupo! As a reward, I shall teleport you to any nation of your choice!${prompt}'
  17297: |-
    Where would like to go, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nowhere.
    San d'Oria.

For the next few days, ${choice: 0}[San d''Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian] vendors will be selling specialty goods from everywhere imaginable, kupo!${prompt}'
  17300: |-
    Oooh! It's ${name-player}!

  17307: |-
    But we've sailed into a slight snag, kupo...
    There are so many adventurers that we've become...a little...confused...${prompt}
  17308: Hey! Maybe you could help us find the right adventurer for each present, kupo!${prompt}
  17309: |-
    I'm sure that if we could just meet them in person, we'd remember which gift was meant for whom.
    All you have to do is make a party with another adventurer, and then visit a moogle, kupo!${prompt}
  17310: We're counting on you, kupo!${prompt}
  17311: 'The recipient for this present was supposed to be ${choice: 8}[level 37 or lower/level 38 or higher].${prompt}'

    Give up for now?
    ${selection-lines}
    That would be best.
    Not just yet!${prompt}
  17316: |-
    Yeah, that's a tough one, kupo.
    But I have plenty of other presents here if you'd still like to help!${prompt}
  17317: Hmmm...I don't think this is the person we're looking for, kupo.${prompt}
  17318: |-
    Hmmm...this isn't the person we're looking for, kupo.
    But, you know what? I think something's coming back to me...${prompt}
  17319: Oh, I stumbled across the present that was meant for the adventurer you brought with you, kupo!${prompt}
  17320: |-
    Presents can be claimed using a card just like this!
    Have your adventurer friend show the card to a moogle and receive a wonderful gift, kupo!${prompt}
  17321: Yes! This is the person I was looking for, kupo!${prompt}
  17322: |-
    Hand this card to your friend.
    It can be given to a moogle in exchange for a present, kupo!${prompt}

    Your help was invaluable!
    Here, this is for you, kupo!${prompt}

    I'm so glad we found you!
    Here's your present, kupo!${prompt}

    What are you trying to pull, kupo!?
    Give this card to the person it's addressed to, and have them come to a moogle to receive a present!${prompt}
  17327: One card at a time! I'm confused enough as it is, kupo!${prompt}
  17328: The San d'Oria residential area is ahead. You'll find your Mog House within.${prompt}

  17344: Celestial Nights has begun, kupo!${prompt}
  17345: An event based on the timeless, tear-jerking tale of tragedy between Prince Yahiko of the Eastern Nation and Princess Amdina of the Western Nation is being held, kupo!${prompt}
  17346: In an interpretive recreation of the tale, two actors have assumed the roles of the prince and princess on a sizzling hot date!${prompt}
  17347: But all is not well...${prompt}
  17348: You see, the town is overflowing with alluringly attractive ladies, kupo.${prompt}
  17349: |-
    Why is that such a bad thing, you ask?
    By distracting the prince from giving his undivided attention to the princess, these vivacious vixens could ruin the event, kupo.${prompt}
  17350: |-
    That must not be allowed to happen!
    If the actor in the prince's role threatens towards fickleness, it's your duty to slap him back to reality--literally!${prompt}
  17351: |-
    And we can't forget about the actress playing the princess, either.
    She's under a lot of pressure to perform, and is prone to being plagued with severe self-doubt about her feelings towards her co-star, kupo.${prompt}
  17352: Only with your moral support could she hope to maintain confidence and perform at her brilliant best. A simple nod would go a long way to reaffirm positive thoughts, while a shake of the head would do wonders to cast out negative ones, kupo!${prompt}
  17353: And going back to the scandalous seductresses I mentioned earlier, you can prevent them from disrupting this royal rendezvous by turning their attention to you. A wave of the hand should do the trick, kupo!${prompt}
  17354: Whatever happens, you must ensure that the date--the event--goes smoothly! I pray for your success on this most meaningful of missions, kupo!${prompt}
  17355: |-
    Princess Amdina, mine one and only!
    I have so longed to once more behold thee! Thou art even more beautiful than when last we met!
  17356: "Thy words pleaseth me, my sweet prince. \nI, too, have ached to be by thy side again."
  17357: Let us make this a reunion that shall never be forgotten! Shall we, my princess?
  17358: Yes, my prince!
  17359: Prince Yahiko, pray forgive me my boldness...but there is something I desire.
  17360: Thou needest but name it, and thine it shall be! There is naught I would deny thee, apple of mine eye.
  17361: |-
    <Blush>...${wait-36: 2}
    Even if thine heart is what I desire, my prince?
  17362: |-
    Hahaha!
    My princess, mine heart has been thine since the day I first laid mine eyes upon thee.
  17363: |-
    Prince Yahiko, pray tell me true...
    I would know why thou dost love me so.
  17364: To answer thy question fully is to tell a tale grander than the greatest epics. Thy beautiful almond eyes that glimmer brighter than the most precious jewels...thy voice of honey that resoundeth more sweetly than angel song...
  17365: Thine entire being is as a soothing spring rain that hath come to nourish the arid desert of my lonely existence.
  17366: |-
    <Blush>...
    My...my prince...I know not what to say...
  17367: Prince Yahiko?
  17368: What is it, my precious?
  17369: |-
    <Blush>...
    It...it is nothing...
  17370: Sweet princess, thou needest not hide anything from me.
  17371: Aaah... The Goddess is good indeed to deliver me a man of such regal persuasion. Praise be!
  17372: |-
    I beg your pardon, Your Highness. Hehehe...
    Far be it from one of my lowly post to make such a brazen request, might I trouble you for the pleasure of your company?
  17373: A-and who dost thou assume to be?
  17374: (Hmph, another shameless festival-goer who knows not where the line is drawn...)
  17375: Ahem! Citizen. That thy kind offer is extended with good intent is plain to see, but the prince hath prior engagements.
  17376: Hmph! Forgive this uneducated peasant girl her ignorance, O Lady Most High!
  17377: Well, Your Highness? Surely, a man of your royal upbringing knows that it is unseemly to keep a lady waiting.
  17378: Uh...if memory serveth me true, this way leadeth to the next standing position...
  17379: P-Prince Yahiko! Whither dost thou think...!
  17380: |-
    Princess Amdina, mine one and only!
    I have so longed to once more behold thee!
  17381: Oh? Your Highness would make me his princess?
  17382: Y-yes! None other but thou art fit to be my bride!
  17383: Good Goddess... This inexplicable bout of amnesia nigh had me wed twice over! Confound my treacherous memory!
  17384: Your Highness toys with my feelings. Yet my heart will always belong to you.
  17385: |-
    Princess Amdina! My beloved!
    Please, find it in thy heart to forgive this foolish prince!
  17386: |-
    Hmph!${wait-36: 2}
    <Sigh>... I believed thou wouldst return to me, my prince.
  17387: Never again shall I leave thy side! This, I swear upon mine honor!
  17388: Yes? May I help you?
  17389: While I'm flattered by your attention, distance grows between me and my prize while I engage in idle conversation.
  17390: There will come a time when we two can exchange pleasantries over a steaming pot of San d'Orian tea, but it is not today. I take my leave of you.
  17391: (The trickiest part in the routine fast approaches... Will I be able to survive it unscathed?)
  17392: (But of course! I've rehearsed often enough to be able to perform the entire routine blindfolded!)
  17393: (Oh, of all the times to be suffering from an acting slump...)
  17394: (Did Amdina truly love Yahiko? The princess as she is portrayed in the tale is one thing, but reality could well be different...)
  17395: (But then again, a love that unites the people of two warring nations couldn't be any less than the truest love of all.)
  17396: (This is surely but another tale grossly embellished for commercial purposes. It shames me to be a part of this blatant moneymaking machine...)
  17397: (It feels...uncannily natural to be playing this role. Could it be that I was the princess in a past life?)
  17398: (All hail Her Royal Highness, Princess Amdina!)
  17399: (But then again, I couldn't hold a candle to the gorgeous actress performing the role in Bastok...)
  17400: (Never before had I dreamed that acting could be so uplifting an experience. It's as though I was born to entertain!)
  17401: (Etch me now into your memory, San d'Oria, for the humble actress whom you behold this day shall tomorrow become an intercontinental star!)
  17402: (But then again, what future could there possibly be for an unremarkable actress such as myself in this cutthroat world?)
  17403: (Do my eyes deceive me? It-it's that world-famous theatrical director! Could he perchance have come here to observe my performance?)
  17404: (He's staring straight at me--there's no mistaking it! What more of a blessing from the Goddess do I need than this? The time has come for me to shine!)
  17405: (But then again, why would a person of his standing travel all the way here for me, a nameless actress? It's naught but a coincidence...)
  17406: (The crowd's turnout today is depressingly poor...)
  17407: (On second thought, it's merely a quiet time of day. I shouldn't read so deeply into it.)
  17408: (To think that I poured my heart into preparing for this role only to be met with indifference...)
  17409: (Is he truly the experienced actor that he purports to be? Every line he spits out sounds so...forced.)
  17410: (All the same, it cannot be denied that he is giving it his all. I suppose it's a trifle early to dismiss him.)
  17411: (What twisted series of incidents could have led to his being chosen for the role?)
  17412: (Hasn't it occurred to anyone that this whole event makes mock of a historically significant tale?)
  17413: (But then again, it can be said that it serves to preserve knowledge and interest in classic literature. In the end, is that not the most important thing of all?)
  17414: (With what madness was I taken to have agreed to this role? I feel so tainted to be party to this...)
  17415: (My throat grows hoarse from all this repetition...)
  17416: (But then again, a clear, resonant voice comes not from the throat, but the stomach. I needn't fret.)
  17417: (Uhngh... My voice...won't carry...like this...)
  17418: (Rumors of my co-star's insufferable womanizing habits have been battering my ears without cease.)
  17419: (But whatever the truth may be, allowing my mind to stray to such irrelevant thoughts in the midst of a performance serves me not in the least.)
  17420: (To think that I've been paired with a loathsome man such as he...)
  17421: (Ack... Every excruciating second spent beside this walking, talking embodiment of incompetence drives me closer to insanity. Best I leave now and preserve what's still intact of my mind.)
  17422: |-
    Princess Amdina!
    Whither dost thou go?
  17423: |-
    My princess...
    If thou findest my company to thy liking no longer, thou needest but voice thy mind, for thine every wish is my command.
  17424: (Well, fancy that. I hadn't expected anything resembling ad-libbing from this one. This warrants a second chance.)
  17425: '''Tis but a simple misunderstanding, my sweet prince. I would have thee join me hither, if it pleaseth thee.'
  17426: Citizen, canst thou spare not the courtesy to allow the princess and I this rare private interlude?
  17427: There is not a single woman in the world who can rival the loveliness of my princess!
  17428: As long as I live, no harm shall ever befall the princess. This, I swear upon mine honor!
  17429: I can bear not even the thought of life without Princess Amdina.
  17430: Only with Princess Amdina doth my existence hold meaning.
  17431: There is not a single moment where the thought of Princess Amdina doth not occupy my mind!
  17432: Citizen, canst thou not see that I am attending to...official business?
  17433: My perfect prince... <Sigh>
  17434: The prince concealeth behind his majestic facade an innocent, childlike aspect that hath awakened my maternal instincts.
  17435: I had always been skeptical towards the idea of destiny. And then I met Prince Yahiko...
  17436: Even when we are far apart, the mere thought of the prince bringeth a comforting warmth to my soul.
  17437: <Sigh> How I hope that one day he will maketh me his bride...
  17438: Only I hold the key which unlocketh his soul!
  17439: |-
    I beseech thee, loyal citizen!
    Deliver the prince back to mine arms!
  17440: You honor us with your esteemed presence, noble adventurer. Do stay a while and enjoy the hospitality of our fair nation.
  17441: My patience has reached its limit. I'll be part of this farce no longer. You're on your own.
  17442: Wh-wh-what!?
  17443: 'A parting word of advice before I take my leave of you: You would do well to invest your...talents...in an alternate branch of entertainment. Such as mime artistry, for example.'
  17444: No! W-wait!
  17445: |-
    Oh, darn... Talk about being put on the spot...
    A-ahem! That concludes the show, folks! We look forward to your company again next time! <Sigh>...
  17446: Prince Yahiko, I shall never forget our reunion this day.
  17447: Nor I, my dear princess.
  17448: It is our fervent hope that thou hast thoroughly enjoyed the Celestial Nights event.${prompt}
  17449: We present this gift to thee, as a token of our gratitude for thine unrelenting support.${prompt}
  17450: |-
    This year's Sunbreeze Festival has begun!
    A special show is being held at the town square as we speak, kupo!${prompt}
  17451: In this show, everybody's favorite frolicking fraulein, Mumor, goes up against her arch-nemesis, the irrepressibly evil demon king, Ullegore!${prompt}
  17452: You, too, have a positively pivotal part to play in this classic battle between good and evil, kupo! Only with your boisterous backing can Mumor hope to banish Ullegore back to his rancorous realm!${prompt}
  17453: If all her fanatical fans' hearts were to beat as one, the tide of battle would surely turn in Mumor's favor, kupo!${prompt}
  17454: |-
    Watch out for when Mumor prepares to unleash her ultimate attack, the “Dancing Force”!
    This is your cue to turn and face the demon king, and dance like you've never danced before, kupo!${prompt}
  17455: We'll be giving away a special prize to everyone who helps Mumor defeat the diabolic demon, so give it your best, kupo!${prompt}

  17506: |-
    Right, Uka?${wait-36: 2}
    Uka?${wait-36: 2}
    Leaping lizards, where could she have run off to?
  17507: Mwahahahaha!
  17508: Who's there!?
  17509: Ah, Mumor. How many years has it been?
  17510: Cinnamon and gravy, it's Ullegore! I won't let you wipe the smiles off my adoring fans' faces!
  17511: |-
    Oho, but wipe I will!${wait-36: 1}
    Uka, come!
  17512: I am herrre, Lord Ullegore.
  17513: N-no!
  17514: Snap this little twig in two.
  17515: By your command.
  17516: Uka...? What's wrong? Why, after all we've been through?
  17517: We're not friends, Mumor. We never were. I exist only to serve his eminence, Lord Ullegore.
  17518: Eeep!
  17519: Stand strong! Believe in the bonds between you and your prancing partner!
  17520: Diva!
  17521: Ullegore underhandedly usurped Uka's will with wicked wizardry! So stop staring and samba her back to her senses!
  17522: And now you turn your back on me, Diva. Very well. I shall sip your tears tonight as well!
  17523: |-
    W-wait...
    Why am I supporting such a second-rate starlet?
  17524: Well, I positively planted my paw in it. No going back now! Go get 'em, girl!
  17525: Don't let Ullegore frazzle you, Uka! I'll bounce those cobwebs right out of your head!
  17526: C'mon, everyone! Let's show Ullegore the true meaning of dance!
  17527: Grk...
  17528: Keep at it!
  17529: Thanks to all your help, I'm beginning to feel tingly and sparkly! Here we go, my lovelies!
  17530: Neo Crystal Jig!!!
  17531: Super Crusher Jig!!!
  17532: Shining Summer Samba!!!
  17533: Lovely Miracle Waltz!!!
  17534: |-
    Urgh...
    It's my turrrn, now!
  17535: Ouchies!
  17536: Please, I need your help!
  17537: Uka...why? Why don't you remember me?
  17538: Mumor!
  17539: |-
    Mwahahaha!
    And so ends the story of the Mighty Maidens--not with a bang, but a whimper!
  17540: Never shall any in this land know fun again!
  17541: Noooooo...!
  17542: And so it came to pass that Mumor was vanquished by her archnemesis and an unending doldrum blanketed land and sea alike.
  17543: The only way this most terrible of fates can be reversed is by lending Mumor strength and spirit, that she may rise once more!
  17544: M-Mumor? What...happened?
  17545: Impossible!
  17546: Uka! You had the butterflies doing laps around my stomach!
  17547: Curse you, Mumor! I would have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for you meddling spectators!
  17548: But don't rest on your laurels just yet!
  17549: He's...he's a person!?
  17550: Countless eons have I flitted from star to star, bringing to each the sweet embrace of boredom.
  17551: But this clamorous world you call Vana'diel refuses to receive my gift.
  17552: Fine. I can still wrap this world in lethargy and ennui, and neither you, Diva, or Uka can stop me!
  17553: No! As long as there are light and smiles in this world, I will rise up to stop you!
  17554: That's our cue, everyone--Firesday Night Fever time!
  17555: Pardon me for breaking the fourth wall, but perhaps an explanation is in order.
  17556: Firesday Night Fever describes the special moments in a songstress's career when she is so intimately connected to her fan base that she can activate her “Dancing Force” without the need of any outward shows of support!
  17557: Hmph. You two are pathetic.
  17558: Goodbye, Ullegore, you've had a nice run!♪
  17559: But the Maidens are here, bringing Vana'diel fun!♪
  17560: The time has arrived to give the dark lord his due!♪
  17561: 'And so, evil spirits, I have this to say: pooh-pooh!♪'
  17562: Wh-what is the meaning of--!
  17563: Now's our chance, Mumor!
  17564: To see the inverted rainbow of your smile...
  17565: We'll dance to the abyss and back!
  17566: Mighty Maidens Mumor and Uka!
  17567: Eternal Vana Illusion!!!
  17568: Graaaaaaaaah!!!
  17569: We surrre gave him his comeuppance!
  17570: H-how could I...?
  17571: Wow, you're way worse at winning than I am!
  17572: You want me to leave your precious festival alone? Fine. I acquiesce.
  17573: Really? 'Cause if you break your promise, it'll be a thousand pricklies for you.
  17574: One thousand, ten thousand...bah, who can keep count?
  17575: C'mon, Mumor! Give him ten thousand right in the kisser!
  17576: Listen, guys! He hasn't broken his promise yet!
  17577: You are a curious one, Mumor. Most would relish in their victory and rub the loser's nose in it...but not you.
  17578: Though I have lost, I do not feel any ill will. Is this what “fun” is?
  17579: Okay, everyone! We've brought peace and happiness back to Vana'diel, so now it's time... I'm finally going to sing!
  17580: M-M-Mumor! D-d-don't!
  17581: Tra laaa laaaaaa...※★△✕▽!!!
  17582: Hm? Why isn't everyone cheering?
  17583: M-Mumor...I told you...not to...
  17584: This whole time...you were tone-deaf...
  17585: No...my number-one nemesis...all along was...some squawking sham!?
  17586: Oh come now, everyone! You're giving me a bad case of the uglies!
  17587: My darling festivalgoers, you brought a spring back to Uka's step and a tear to my eye! I love you...each and every one of you!
  17588: Why, without you, Ullegore would be running rampant across the land!
  17589: Next time I'll have a super-sweet melody prepared, so keep those ears open and wait with bated breath!
  17590: But for now...enjoy the festival!

  17609: Do you really think I'm worthy? But...my singing...${prompt}
  17610: Being an idol isn't only about singing and dancing.${prompt}
  17611: It's about winning the hearts of your fans and having them support you through thick and thin.${prompt}
  17612: I raised you to be an idol so that one day you might save the world. A father could be no prouder of his daughter.${prompt}

  17620: I was positively tickled to see you in the crowd. Can I ask your name?${prompt}
  17621: ${name-player}, your dancing was positively peachy!♪${prompt}

  17635: A revival of Mumor's final performance will soon be underway.${prompt}
  17636: As always, your steadfast support can greatly affect the outcome of this magnificent show. Let me tell you how.${prompt}
  17637: Like any good diva, Mumor requires the cheers of her fans to unlock her true potential in the struggles that lie ahead. In short, your emotions are her strength.${prompt}
  17638: /clapping, /cheering, and /waving all have a positive effect on her, and switching between them has a greater effect than repeating the same one over and over.${prompt}
  17639: When Mumor has received enough accolades from her fans, she will unleash one of her powerful dance moves. When she does, dance along with her!${prompt}

  17643: That should cover it.${prompt}
  17644: Dancing the proper steps in sync with Mumor will strengthen the bond between the two of you.${prompt}
  17645: So unite as one to give Mumor the energy she so desperately needs!${prompt}
  17646: We will also be selling a variety of festival goods throughout the event. The more you buy, the happier Mumor becomes, so do your idol proud!${prompt}
  17647: That does it for the explanation of our event. I hope you enjoy the show!${prompt}
  17648: A super-special Starlight Celebration to you, ambitious adventurer!${prompt}
  17649: What am I saying!? This is hardly the time for gleeful greetings or alliterative addresses, kupo!${prompt}
  17650: |-
    Even as we speak, overzealous Goblins are partaking not just in the Starlight Celebration spirit, but others' precious presents!
    These Gobbies bear no bad blood, but their covetous capers are the cause of much consternation, kupo.${prompt}
  17651: |-
    And to make matters worse, they've even filched the furnishings the MHMU ordered from the guilds...
    I know the saying, “If you give a Goblin goulash...” but this is just rikupulous!${prompt}
  17652: |-
    Please, ${name-player}, I beseech you!
    Find the Goblins traipsing about town and teach them the meaning of private property once and for all!
    (By affably asking them to relinquish what they requisitioned, kupo.)${prompt}
  17653: |-
    It may seem like the MHMU is just exploiting the nearest adventurer, but nay! You--and only you--are capable of restoring resplendence and revelry to the realm.
    Now go forth and fulfill the festive fate we thrust upon you, kupo!${prompt}
  17654: |-
    Kupopopo!
    Have you forgotten your merry mission already? Get giddy, gift-grabbing Goblins around town to give back people's goods, then go gab to a Moogle when you're done.${prompt}
  17655: |-
    And remember, Gobbies like to stick their noses in other creatures' business, if you know what I mean.
    Snuff out your smell so they can't sense your spoils, kupo.${prompt}
  17656: |-
    And remember, Goblins go cuckoo for comestibles, kupo.
    Offer them their favorite food, for they should forget you even exist.${prompt}
  17657: |-
    And remember, Goblins just want to jump for joy and jubilation at this jocular time of year.
    Bequeath beastmen bills or bedazzling bijoux to them and you may find yourself furnished with furnishings in return, kupo.${prompt}
  17658: |-
    Great glorious Goddess, you've managed to procure a present! Praise be to your positively prodigious persistence!
    ...And your altruistic attitude after you return it to its rightful remitter, kupo!${prompt}
  17659: |-
    It looks like this gift is from someone named ${entity: 0}. Seek out the sender and start spreading some Starlight spirit, kupo!
    Oh, and watch out for mischievous Goblin mitts, my little gofer--I mean adventurer!${prompt}
  17660: |-
    Wonderful work, warden of weal!
    However, since giving is greater than receiving, how about giving ${entity: 0} word that you were able to deliver the present?${prompt}
  17661: |-
    The considerable amount of charity you've shown complete strangers cannot be overstated, kupo.
    Without your magnanimity, moxie, and master mediation skills, this year's Starlight Celebration would have been a much dimmer affair.${prompt}
  17662: |-
    Yet to polish this party to the point of pristine luster, more Goblins must be taught the difference between naughty and nice!
    Remember, once you give back a gift, seal the deal by simply sauntering over to the nearest moogle.
    We're counting on you, kupo!${prompt}
  17663: The MHMU humbly offers you this token of our thanks, not only for making the world a brighter place, but for tolerating our moogle mummery and the voluminous vats of verbosity that violated your virgin ears.${prompt}
  17664: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! I forgot those festive Gobbies are still frolicking with our furnishings, kupo!${prompt}
  17665: |-
    I'm so sorry to solicit further favors from you, but could you kindly retrieve those as well?
    Pretty please with paprika on top? You wouldn't want to keep us from rewarding the good boys and girls of Vana'diel, would you, kupo?${prompt}
  17666: |-
    Kupo ho ho! Do my deteriorating eyes deceive me, or is that one of the furnishings we ordered?
    We'd planned on giving them all to needy orphans, but you've done so much for the MHMU recently, why don't you have this one? 'Tis the season, so they say.${prompt}
  17667: |-
    What an astounding accomplishment, as expected of an adventurer like you!
    We are eternally grateful for the copious kindnesses you've conferred upon us, kupo.${prompt}
  17668: |-
    Word around the union fountain is that other nations' furnishings still remain at large. Would it be too terrible a torment to traipse around town--peepers peeled for gregarious Gobbies ogling purported presents--the next time you visit another nation?
    The MHMU would be forever in your debt, kupo.${prompt}
  17669: (Wheeew, way to whisk that one under the rug. I could never tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] that we got distracted by the dazzling decorations and had the furnishings nabbed from nigh under our noses!)${prompt}
  17670: Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?♪

  17676: '...'
  17677: You have friend, you do? We Gobbies have friend too.
  17678: Yum-yums for me? Gobbies remember...till our tummies go rumble-rumble again.
  17679: |-
    For me!? Why give so nice thing to me!?
    Me so happy head go boom! So boom!
    But first, me need give happy toy to you too.
  17680: |-
    Happy toy? For me?
    Why you give so good thing to me?
    But no can take. Me have no happy toy for you.
  17681: |-
    Blech. What this yucky thing?
    It make me want upgut food. Take it away.
  17682: |-
    What? But how...?
    If that's truly from ${entity: 0}, that must mean...you stole it and you're ransoming it back to me!
    If you think for one moment that I'd pay scum like you, you'd best think twice!${prompt}
  17683: |-
    Oh, I see. My apologies.
    How silly of me. Everyone knows how mischievous Goblins get during the Starlight Celebration season. I read somewhere that it's got something to do with the moon and the tides or whatnot.${prompt}
  17684: |-
    Anyway, sorry to trouble you, but could you deliver this in my stead?
    I may look like a strapping young lad, but I have this illness that prevents me from doing the same task twice in one day. Quite troublesome, really.${prompt}
  17685: |-
    Also, could you do me a favor and report back to me after you're done?
    I didn't want to spend the extra gil for delivery confirmation with times as tough as they are, you know?${prompt}
  17686: |-
    I take it you delivered my present safe and sound?
    Oh, and it was well received, too? Ha, you didn't need to tell me that, for my gifts are always a hit.
    I guess I should thank you though, seeing as how you played a tiny part in my Starlight Celebration success.${prompt}
  17687: |-
    Waaah, a cutthroat! Take anything you want, just not my lucky chocobo hose, please! I...
    Wait, isn't that the gift I sent ${entity: 0}? You didn't steal that too, did you!?${prompt}
  17688: |-
    What!? You...valiantly wrested it from the clutches of a greedy Goblin so you could return it to me?
    I just knew my ${choice-player-gender}[handsome champion/fair handmaiden] in resplendent regalia would come some day!${prompt}
  17689: |-
    I'm sure you've been through quite a few trials and tribulations just getting this back to me, your fair lady. However, my hands are tied at the moment and I can't take this present to ${entity: 0}.
    Therefore, I command you, my loyal follower, to act as my liaison and deliver it unscathed. I have no doubt that you'll succeed, since a ${choice-player-gender}[knight/handmaiden] will do anything to serve and protect ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] mistress.${prompt}
  17690: And please don't forget to check in with me after the delivery is made. Every ${choice-player-gender}[champion/handmaiden] knows that's the ${choice-player-gender}[chivalrous/proper] thing to do.${prompt}
  17691: |-
    How fared your journey, my ${choice-player-gender}[courageous champion/humble handmaiden]?
    Oh, I simply knew I could place my complete trust in you! You've not only made your fair lady quite proud, but saved the Starlight Celebration from those covetous beastmen! Oh, joyous day!${prompt}
  17692: 'I beg your pardon, but I cannot help but notice that this is the parcel I sent to ${entity: 0}. How might you have come by it?${prompt}'
  17693: |-
    Ah, I see. Those Goblin rapscallions still show a complete and utter disregard for social graces, would you not agree?
    At any rate, you seem to possess a rather strong sense of justice, and for that I am most grateful.${prompt}
  17694: 'Could you also find it within your heart to see that this package reaches ${entity: 0} safely? I may be a man of humble means, but you will certainly have my eternal gratitude and undying admiration.${prompt}'
  17695: |-
    Oh my. This utterly slipped my addled mind.
    I am truly sorry, but I fear I must heap one more request upon your already burdened back. Could you please report back to me after you've made the delivery?
    It would undoubtedly lessen the anxiety weighing down my fragile heart.${prompt}
  17696: |-
    Goddess be good, you have returned! And with favorable tidings, no?
    Splendid. Absolutely splendid. Thanks to you, I feel as if I could burst into a Starlight carol at any moment. Fa-la-la-la～♪.${prompt}
  17697: |-
    What doth bring thee 'fore these rheumy eyes, orbs that pierce the soul and a stranger's guise?
    Harken, thou hast ${entity: 0}'s present, from whom hast thou received such consent?${prompt}
  17698: |-
    'Tis an entertaining tale with which thy jowls doth flail,
    A tale of Goblins run amok, and wretched me bereft of luck.
    Still, thanks are in store for completing this chore with a dearth of gore.${prompt}

    While these next words may conjure a storm, I cannot assist thee in any form.
    Thus, I entreat thee to heed the call...deliver this gift to ${entity: 0} once and for all!${prompt}
  17700: |-
    'Fore I finish this lengthy tirade, one last request must be made.
    Once the gift hath changed hands, return at once for further plans.${prompt}
  17701: |-
    Thou hast safely returned from thy trial? Upon us both doth Altana smile!
    To thee, the savior of the Starlight Celebration, I do give heartfelt acclamations!${prompt}
  17702: |-
    Wh-wh-what have you got there? It looks awfully-wafully like the gift I gave to ${entity: 0}.
    Did something happen? P-p-please don't tell me that ${entity: 0} passy-wassed away!${prompt}
  17703: |-
    ...It was just a G-g-goblin prank?
    Sorry to overreactaru. I had a t-t-traumatic experience last Starlight Devastation--er, Celebration! So now I always feary-wear the worst.
    By the way, th-th-thank you for getting my gift back.${prompt}
  17704: 'As you can guess, m-m-my comfort zone is rather itty-bitty. I know you must be expired--tired! But can you please helpy-welp me and deliver my present to ${entity: 0}?${prompt}'
  17705: |-
    After you pass on--the gift! Pass the gift on! Then c-c-could you report back to me?
    I truly-wuly want to know how ${entity: 0} reacts.${prompt}
  17706: |-
    Ah, you're back!
    It's ${entity: 0}'s most perished, er, cherished possession, you say? Wh-wh-what lofty-wofty praise!
    I can't thank you enough for your c-c-contributions, adventurer.${prompt}
  17707: |-
    So many nasty-wasty things happened to me today, I'm just too moody-woody to listen to your blather!
    Begone before I--wait, isn't that my present to ${entity: 0}?${prompt}
  17708: Ugh, quit barking like a bog dog, ${choice-player-gender}[brother-wother/sister-wister]! I don't give a ham and cheese about giddy Goblins or lazy moogles.${prompt}
  17709: |-
    You think you're so great because you saved my present from some baddie-waddies? Bah humbug-wumbug!
    If you're gonna stick your nosey-wose in others' business, then you bettaru finish what you started!
    You'll be taking that gift on over to ${entity: 0}, I tell you what!${prompt}
  17710: |-
    And don't think for a minute-winute that I'm going to let you get away with ruining my day! Report back here for a tongue-lashing when you're done!
    Now get going before I gutaru you right here and now!${prompt}
  17711: |-
    Hmph, so you're stupid as well as rude? Are you so subservient that you'd actually come backy-wack for a beating?
    Get out of my face! You disgustaru me. Oh, and Merry Starlight!${prompt}
  17712: 'Hey, I sent that to ${entity: 0}. Why do you have it?${prompt}'
  17713: |-
    Hmmm. Stolen by Gobbies, huh?
    Thanks for getting it back.${prompt}
  17714: 'Sorry to burden you, but could you bring it to ${entity: 0} again for me?${prompt}'
  17715: Also, I'd like it if you could please fill me in when you're done.${prompt}
  17716: |-
    I see you've returned.
    Mmm...that's good news indeed. Thank you for the kindness you've shown me and my friend.${prompt}
  17717: |-
    What have we here? A cat burrrglar?
    How dare you despoil the innocent people of our fair nation!${prompt}
  17718: |-
    What am I talking about?
    That's the prrresent I sent ${entity: 0}! How could you have it if you didn't steal it!?${prompt}
  17719: |-
    Oh, I see. You're a defender of justice too.
    Good job negotiating with those Goblin scum. I just hope that rrrepeating that story to everyone you've saved hasn't got you hacking up hairballs.${prompt}
  17720: 'But enough tail wagging. I have some prey I need to take care of, so could you rrredeliver that gift to ${entity: 0} and report back to me when you''re done?${prompt}'
  17721: |-
    What timing! I've just rrreturned from my own mission.
    Whew, good thing ${entity: 0} liked it! That little trinket was as high priced as the hair on a cat's back!
    Anyway, thanks for your help. If your fur ever gets rubbed the wrong way, give me a sign and I'll come rrroaring to the rescue!${prompt}
  17722: |-
    A present...from ${entity: 0}? Oh, glorious day!
    This is for all those times I never got a present and kept telling myself next year will be the one.${prompt}
  17723: |-
    I'm at a loss for what to say! I'm just overwhelmed with a waterfall of emotion!
    Thank you so much!${prompt}
  17724: |-
    And please thank ${entity: 0} the next time you see that good samaritan.
    The person who said, “'Tis better to give than receive” probably never had a gift drought as long as mine. I feel fantastic!${prompt}
  17725: 'Oh, is that...a present? From ${entity: 0}, you say?${prompt}'
  17726: |-
    Ugh, it figures. Did it come with a card that says something pathetic like “I've died a thousand deaths drowning in the depths of your eyes”?
    That scoundrel has been stalking me ever since we happened to meet one day on a boat to Buburimu Peninsula.${prompt}
  17727: |-
    I'm actually quite fed up with these ridiculous baubles, but I'm not one for losing face.
    If you should see ${entity: 0} again, please give my regards and say I found the gift rather...quaint.${prompt}
  17728: 'What''s this? A present addressed to me from ${entity: 0}?${prompt}'
  17729: How unexpectedly charming and thoughtful. This has certainly brightened what was about to be a gloomy Starlight Celebration.${prompt}
  17730: |-
    Would you be so kind as to tell ${entity: 0} that I truly appreciate the gift?
    I am also thoroughly impressed with your selfless nature, adventurer.${prompt}
  17731: 'Could it be...? Indeed, it is benevolence manifest, emanating from the humble home of one ${entity: 0}?${prompt}'
  17732: |-
    What a decidedly pleasant surprise. I am simply beside myself with an unbridled, childish glee that has not washed over me in ever so long.
    I swear that I am on the brink of giggling like I used to when I was still knee-high to a Taru.${prompt}
  17733: 'The finite words of us mere mortals may not be sufficient to convey the depths of my gratitude, but I earnestly hope ${entity: 0} would appreciate a succinct “Thank you.”${prompt}'
  17734: 'A present from...${entity: 0}? This isn''t one of those tricky-wicky flimflams, is it?${prompt}'
  17735: |-
    Of course I'll take it! I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, even if it's from my mortaru enemy!
    Maybe ${entity: 0} has turned over a new leaf since we last met...${prompt}
  17736: Well then, I suppose some thanks are in order. But if I find out that this was just some elaborataru scheme to make me lower my guard, I'm going to boppy-wop you both in the noggin!${prompt}
  17737: |-
    Oooh, a gift from ${entity: 0}?
    What jolly-wolly tidings you've brought, adventurer.${prompt}
  17738: |-
    I wonder what's inside... Could it be a scrum-diddly-umptious cake?
    But I've already gotten so roly-poly during the holiday season! Maybe I should just send it back! ${prompt}
  17739: |-
    No, thataru wouldn't be right. Besides, it might not be edible.
    Anyway, please be sure to thank ${entity: 0} for pudding the icing on such a delectable Starcake Chocolation.
    Ugh, I'm just terrible!${prompt}
  17740: 'Why would ${entity: 0} be sending me a gift? It''s not like there''s anything special going on.${prompt}'
  17741: |-
    The Starlight Celebration, you say? So that explains the light shows and festive atmosphere around here lately.
    My head just hasn't been the same since I fell off that chocobo last month.${prompt}
  17742: |-
    I best start looking for something to give in return. In the meantime, please tell ${entity: 0} how happy I am to have received this.
    And maybe next year I'll remember before it's too late. <Sigh>...One can only hope.${prompt}
  17743: "A present for me? \nI'm a lone lioness, and I don't need to share my kills with anyone!${prompt}"
  17744: 'What? ${entity: 0} wanted me to have this? Well, I guess I could take it...${prompt}'

    Don't get the wrrrong idea! It's not like I enjoy the gift or anything!
    Just run back to ${entity: 0} and drop dead! This conversation never happened!${prompt}

    You there! Yes, you!
    Come here for a moment.${prompt}
  17751: You are a member of the Carpenters' Guild, are you not?${prompt}
  17752: |-
    The splinters in your hands told me as much.
    And your eyes tell me that you'd be just the one to aid a fellow guildswoman in her time of need...
    Am I right?${prompt}
  17753: I trust you've heard of the periodic timber survey conducted by our guild?${prompt}
  17754: |-
    'Tis a simple enough, if uninspiring affair.
    Travel to all regions with harvestable trees and ensure that there has been no deterioration in the quality of the timber.${prompt}
  17755: As guild tradition goes, I and my fellow greenhorns were tapped by the guildmaster for this tedious task.${prompt}
  17756: |-
    My overachieving guildmates have already submitted their reports, leaving only my assigned area--Jugner Forest--incomplete.
    But look at me! Armoires to assemble, bookshelves to build...
    I can scarcely afford a moment away from my sawhorse!${prompt}
  17757: |-
    Sadly, Grand Master Ulycille isn't hearing any of my excuses.
    Just look at her eyes! If I don't finish the survey soon, her quill pen dagger is going to coming flying through my skull like a nail through wood! At best, I'll be expelled from the guild.${prompt}
  17758: |-
    That's where you come in.
    I need you to travel to Jugner Forest and complete this survey for me.${prompt}
  17759: |-
    What do you say?
    ${selection-lines}
    My pleasure!
    Not today.${prompt}
  17760: |-
    Hmph! Fine, then!
    Just don't expect any favors when you become old Ulycille's next target!${prompt}
  17761: |-
    Splendid! I knew I could count on a fellow carpenter.
    Now then, allow me to explain the details.${prompt}
  17762: As I said before, the task is quite simple.${prompt}
  17763: First, you must venture forth to Jugner Forest.${prompt}
  17764: 'Once there, you need only seek out the varieties of timber listed here on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, determine whether or not they can be harvested, and make note of the results.${prompt}'
  17765: 'Return to me with the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and one log of each type of timber you felled, and your task is complete!${prompt}'
  17766: "Easy as hammering a nail, is it not? \nSo are you ready to go forth?${prompt}"
  17767: |-
    Ready?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure am!
    Could you explain that again?${prompt}
  17768: |-
    What's the matter? Sawdust clogging your ears?
    Okay, but listen carefully this time.${prompt}
  17769: |-
    Wonderful! You're quite literally saving my life.
    Anyway, here's the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and a freshly sharpened ${item-singular: 1[2]} to aid you in your task.
    Best of luck to you!${prompt}
  17770: |-
    My future as a carpenter is in your hands.
    I know you won't let me down!${prompt}

  17772: Now let's see here...${prompt}
  17773: Excellent! You've completed the entire checklist!${prompt}
  17774: Needless to say, you remembered to bring back a sample of each type of timber, did you not?${prompt}

    Almost there!
    Just ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} remaining, and you'll be done.${prompt}

  17780: |-
    What's this? Not even a single sample?
    I didn't entrust you with this survey so you could go on a pleasant forest stroll.
    You actually have to harvest the timber, you know!${prompt}
  17781: You'll have to return to Jugner Forest to complete the survey.${prompt}
  17782: '...And that makes five. Splendid work!${prompt}'

    As for the timber you harvested, you may keep it for your own purposes.

    Trading cinder.${prompt}
  17910: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  17911: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  17912: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  17913: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  17914: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  17915: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  17916: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  17917: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  17918: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  17919: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  17920: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  17921: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  17922: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  17923: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  17924: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  17925: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  17926: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  17927: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  17928: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  17929: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  17930: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  17931: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  17932: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  17933: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  17934: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  17935: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  17936: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  17937: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  17938: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  17939: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  17940: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  17941: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  17942: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  17943: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  17944: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  17945: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  17946: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  17947: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  17948: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  17949: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  17950: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  17951: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  17952: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  17953: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  17954: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  17955: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  17956: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  17957: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  17958: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  17959: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  17960: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  17961: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  17962: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  17963: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  17964: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  17965: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  17966: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  17967: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  17968: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  17969: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  17970: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  17971: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  17972: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  17973: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  17974: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  17975: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  17976: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  17977: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  17978: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  17979: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  17980: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  17981: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  17982: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  17983: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  17984: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  17985: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  17986: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  17987: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  17988: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  17989: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  17990: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  17991: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  17992: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  17993: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  17994: |-
    A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.

  18013: |-
    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  18014: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  18015: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  18016: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  18017: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  18018: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  18019: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  18020: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  18021: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  18022: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  18023: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}

  18061: |-
    Halver and my son present a compelling case.
    Return to this Empress, and tell her San d'Oria stands with her.
    Now farewell, and may the Goddess watch over your journey!${prompt}
  18062: Yes? Is there something you need?${prompt}
  18063: |-
    Do you have a question?
    ${selection-lines}
    Not really.
    About your father...
    About your grandfather...${prompt}
  18064: |-
    Father? He said he had business at the weaponseller's in the southern part of town.
    Are you an acquaintance of his?${prompt}
  18065: |-
    He's so engrossed in his blades that he's not given me a swordfighting lesson in weeks!
    At this rate, I shall never become a knight...${prompt}
  18066: |-
    I am loath to boast, but his knowledge of armor and weaponry is second to none in the Kingdom.
    Helbort often consults with him about rare orders.${prompt}
  18067: |-
    You've heard of Grandfather? That does not surprise me.
    He was, after all, an angler of no small repute.${prompt}
  18068: |-
    Why, in his younger days, he would rise at the crack of dawn, and hike through Jugner Forest to Lake Mechieume.
    There, he would lose himself in fishing until sunset. Remarkable devotion, is it not?${prompt}
  18069: |-
    Oh, would that I could go on such a fishing trip with my own father!
    Alas, it seems he did not inherit Grandfather's love for the sport...${prompt}
  18070: |-
    Be this your first visit to the cathedral?
    All of Altana's children are welcome here.${prompt}
  18071: Hmm? Pray excuse me, but I could not help but notice your interest in that man.${prompt}
  18072: |-
    His is a heart-rending tale. He seeks absolution for his callous treatment of a distraught young lady.
    As her name is unknown to him, he refers to her only as “the red-haired maiden.”${prompt}
  18073: |-
    Young man. Nary a day passes by that you are not here, offering words of prayer.
    Surely, such devotion shall not go unnoticed by the Goddess.${prompt}
  18074: <Sigh> I sincerely wish that it were so, friar. Then I might have peace in my heart once more...${prompt}
  18075: I shall return to adding my prayers to those of others.${prompt}
  18076: May Paradise open its gates to you.${prompt}
  18077: You seek the young man from a moment ago? I'm made to understand he was headed for Laborman's Way.${prompt}
  18078: Hm? Aren't you the adventurer from the cathedral?${prompt}
  18079: |-
    You...wish to know more of the maiden?
    It appears my sad exploits have attained notoriety far and wide...${prompt}
  18080: |-
    Very well. I have no reason to conceal this from you.
    On the contrary, I welcome it that more people would know me for the contemptible wretch that I am.${prompt}
  18081: |-
    What!? That fair maiden...is your friend!?
    Please, you must tell me where I might find her!${prompt}
  18082: |-
    So not even you know of her whereabouts...
    I suppose there is no help for that.${prompt}
  18083: Allow me to recount my tale then, as promised.${prompt}
  18084: It all began the day past when I went to attend a sermon at the cathedral.${prompt}
  18085: That was when I first caught sight of her, as she stepped through the doors, bathed in the radiant light of morn.${prompt}
  18086: |-
    Trite though this must sound, never before had I laid eyes upon such fairness.
    I still remember well the ornament that adorned her fiery hair...${prompt}
  18087: |-
    But above all, I remember the deep sorrow that was graven upon her face.
    To simply imagine the pain that racked her gentle heart sent a dagger sliding through mine own.${prompt}
  18088: The intensity of my emotions was such that I could not help but reach out to her.${prompt}
  18089: B-beg pardons, my lady! If I might have a m-m-moment...${prompt}
  18090: Have we met?${prompt}
  18091: |-
    Um...uh... (Breathe, damn you! Breathe!)
    S-s-something weighs heavily on your mind, that much is p-p-plain to see.
    I should be honored to share that burden, if it p-p-please you.${prompt}
  18092: '''Tis kind of you to offer, but I would not presume to prevail upon a stranger.${prompt}'
  18093: No, I insist! If there is aught I might do to ease your p-p-pain, you need but ask!${prompt}
  18094: This is...highly unusual for me, but since you insist...${prompt}
  18095: For true!? You've no idea how much this m-m-means to me!${prompt}
  18096: |-
    To think that this vision of beauty would share with me her deepest hurts! I was above the moon with joy!
    That is, until she launched into her story...${prompt}
  18097: |-
    She claimed to be a “Champion of the Dawn,” possessed of the ability to travel to the past.
    Powerful enemies had come from an alternate reality, and she was battling against them to ensure the survival of our world.${prompt}
  18098: |-
    In the midst of the struggle, however, someone dear to her fell into enemy hands.
    And to compound matters, those who once cared for her lost all memory of her existence.${prompt}
  18099: <Sigh>... I consider myself worldly and well-traveled, but naught could've prepared me for the words that spilled from her lips.${prompt}
  18100: At some point in time--I cannot say exactly when--bemusement turned into amusement, and I decided that all of it was a great big fairy tale.${prompt}
  18101: I found myself staring at her wide-eyed, nodding dutifully as the events--each more fantastical and ridiculous than the last--were regaled to me in intricate detail.${prompt}
  18102: And then the guillotine fell. I did that which cannot be undone.${prompt}
  18103: Heaheaheaheahhh!!!${prompt}
  18104: H-hey! What's so funny!?${prompt}
  18105: M-mercy, my lady, but any more of this and my sides are like to burst!${prompt}
  18106: What!?${prompt}
  18107: I don't believe this! You beg me to share my burden, and I oblige you for what? To have you rain spittle on me with your laughter!?${prompt}
  18108: |-
    Hmph! That's right, it was all make-believe!
    That you derived such mirth from my tall tale made it worth the telling! I thank you for your precious time!${prompt}
  18109: Farewell...and Atomos take you!${prompt}
  18110: I must be either losing my mind or the biggest fool in the world to think it a good idea to pour my heart out to some boorish stranger.${prompt}
  18111: |-
    Atomo...what?
    M-my lady, where are you going?${prompt}
  18112: In hindsight, the graveness with which she told her story ought to have been plain as day, even to this blind dolt.${prompt}
  18113: |-
    Whether or not there was truth to her words was immaterial. The point is, she believed the genuineness of her tale.
    As such, it was utterly tactless of me--cruel, rather--to make light of her as I did.${prompt}
  18114: Ah, what I wouldn't give for a chance to see her again and beg forgiveness...${prompt}
  18115: |-
    You and I scarce know one another, but might I trouble you to...tell me her name?
    The truth is, I've not been able to sleep at night for want of this knowledge.${prompt}
  18116: In light of the grievous wrong I did your friend, I would not be surprised if you were to begrudge me this favor. Yet I must ask that you take pity on me.${prompt}
  18117: |-
    Tell him Lilisette's name?
    ${selection-lines}
    Aye, the poor sod seems repentant.
    Nay, leave him to wallow in his misery.${prompt}
  18118: |-
    Lilisette...
    A beautiful name...${prompt}
  18119: P-please! I beg of you!${prompt}
  18120: I owe you a debt of gratitude.${prompt}
  18121: Having had this opportunity to talk to you, it feels as if the weight of the world has been lifted off my shoulders.${prompt}
  18122: May the Goddess bless you thrice over, kind adventurer.${prompt}

    You obtain ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.
    However, it is far too small to house an adequate amount of energy. Alone, it serves no purpose.${prompt}

    Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?
    Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt}
  18128: |-
    That's where I come in, kupo.
    I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt}
  18129: 'To make use of my services, first you''ll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt}'
  18130: Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt}
  18131: You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt}
  18132: Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt}
  18133: |-
    Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.
    I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt}
  18134: |-
    Invisible to you, at least.
    It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt}
  18135: When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt}
  18136: |-
    I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.
    Simple as that, kupo!${prompt}
  18137: |-
    What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!
    Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt}
  18138: |-
    Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.
    So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt}
  18139: For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt}
  18140: |-
    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!
    It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt}
  18141: Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt}
  18142: |-
    If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!
    No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
    Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}
  18143: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt}
  18144: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt}
  18145: |-
    And that's all there is to it.

  18684: Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.${prompt}
  18685: The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.${prompt}
  18686: It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.${prompt}
  18687: The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.${prompt}
  18688: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  18689: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt}
  18690: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt}
  18691: 'Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of ${number: 0} accolades per week (Earth time).${prompt}'
  18692: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt}
  18693: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt}
  18694: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt}
  18695: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt}
  18696: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt}
  18697: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt}
  18698: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt}
  18699: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt}
  18700: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt}
  18701: 'Additionally, an individual''s evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity''s ranking is the average of all eligible members'' individual evaluations.${prompt}'
  18702: The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt}
  18703: Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt}
  18704: 'Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt}'
  18705: Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt}
  18706: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt}
  18707: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt}
  18708: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt}
  18709: It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt}
  18710: Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.${prompt}

  18723: I've been trying to figure out as much as I can about the strange portals that link our Vana'diel to another dimension.${prompt}
  18724: But we've got other problems to deal with first. Let's worry about it once we've finished our current mission.${prompt}
  18725: I'll meet you at the Crag of Holla in La Theine Plateau once we've got that burden off our shoulders. Or we could catch up at Dem or Mea, if that's preferable to you.${prompt}

  18732: In reality, it is a piece of the mothercrystal.${prompt}

  18741: Had I been able to better serve you, then maybe...${prompt}

  18748: I am afraid that you will not be able to see her in the world's current state.${prompt}

  18763: The endless nightmare would be endless no longer.${prompt}
  18764: Have you ever paused to consider exactly whose nightmare it is?${prompt}

  18766: Old gods? New?${prompt}
  18767: No. It is a nightmare of the crystals themselves.${prompt}

  18772: And it continues to claw its way forward, even if what it aspires to be does not truly exist.${prompt}
  18773: Its insatiable avarice defines it more than even it can possibly realize.${prompt}
  18774: But I am not a “human” such as you. I will be--I must be--an existence far beyond the most grandiose thought of such petty, grasping beings.${prompt}
  18775: For that is what life is. And those who cannot reach that pinnacle are fated to perish.${prompt}

  18945: Oh, hello again. If you don't mind me asking, what is that shield you're carrying?${prompt}
  18946: Hmm... I can see that you've spoken with her already.${prompt}
  18947: Yes, I heard her tale about the shield that can enhance one's crafting ability. I'm not sure if I believe it or not, though...${prompt}
  18948: Although, if it's true, that would definitely make it a shield worth having.${prompt}
  18949: I know what you're capable of in our field, and if she picked you for this task, it must mean you've got what it takes to make this shield.${prompt}
  18950: First things first. Let's teach you the necessary recipe. I recommend that you commit it to memory.${prompt}
  18951: 'Very well then. The first ingredient you will need is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  18952: 'Its purpose is to increase the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its maximum value.${prompt}'
  18953: I have actually received some notes on Craftsmanship that you should probably hear.${prompt}
  18954: 'You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt}'
  18955: Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.${prompt}
  18956: In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt}
  18957: You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt}
  18958: That is all that it says.${prompt}
  18959: 'Once you''ve raised the Craftsmanship, please bring me the shield and I will make the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  18960: 'Next, you will need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}, which can be obtained from Luren.${prompt}'
  18961: You have made a delivery or two before, yes? That's essentially what you need to do here to receive these items.${prompt}
  18962: Please speak to Luren if you require more information.${prompt}
  18963: That does it for the ingredients. Please show me the shield once you've upgraded it. I would like to see it.${prompt}
  18964: How is it that you managed to forget the recipe? Very well. Here is the list of ingredients again. Remember, true professionals do not need to hear things twice.${prompt}
  18965: You are where you are due to hard work and dedication. I have faith that you can do this.${prompt}
  18966: 'I see... With this, I think I can make the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  18967: 'So this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  18968: The ability to pour my soul into this shield and create a crystal from it... I have no idea how it works, but it is really quite fascinating.${prompt}
  18969: 'This is strange. In creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it somehow lowered the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  18970: 'In the end, that is not really a problem if you want to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but you will need to bring the Craftsmanship back up if you want to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  18971: However, I really doubt that you would ever lose such a valuable item.${prompt}
  18972: 'Impossible. You mean you actually managed to misplace the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  18973: 'Oh well. I will make you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, so please let me borrow your shield.${prompt}'
  18974: You are a professional. As such, you need to make sure you take proper care of your ingredients.${prompt}
  18975: It looks like you made the upgrade. Do you mind if I take a look?${prompt}
  18976: Hmm... The shape is different, and I can feel a faint energy emanating from it... Although, it clearly is not complete just yet.${prompt}
  18977: No, you'll need to craft multiple times in order to get the best performance out of it. That's what she told me anyway.${prompt}
  18978: That reminds me, I'm supposed to mark the shield when it's finished. Please give me a moment.${prompt}
  18979: That should do it.${prompt}
  18980: Please take the shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno for me.${prompt}
  18981: Oh, I also have regular deliveries for Luren. It would be quite helpful for training the newer members of the guild if you could help me with them.${prompt}
  18982: Thank you for coming. I already heard about why you are here.${prompt}
  18983: Let's get started then, shall we? Here is the recipe you'll need.${prompt}
  18984: Do you have any questions?${prompt}
  18985: 'Now, allow me to explain how to obtain the ingredients, starting with the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  18986: 'Like with the aspis last time, you will need to equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} while crafting in order to boost its Craftsmanship to 100%.${prompt}'
  18987: However, you will need to work even harder to imbue your spirit into the shield this time, so it will probably take a while before you are successful.${prompt}
  18988: 'Once it reaches 100%, bring me the shield and I''ll make the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  18989: 'The next ingredient is the ${item-singular: 2[2]}. I''ve left it along with the ${item-singular: 3[2]} you used last time with Luren.${prompt}'
  18990: 'Lastly, the ${item-singular: 4[2]}... I asked the A.M.A.N. to help me prepare some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt}'
  18991: 'You will receive the ${item-singular: 4[2]} once you complete all of them.${prompt}'
  18992: That's it for the ingredients. You have a long and hard road ahead of you, but I have faith that you can handle it.${prompt}
  18993: I see you have increased the Craftsmanship to the necessary level.${prompt}
  18994: 'Wait a moment while I prepare the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  18995: Yes, that turned out rather well, I must say.${prompt}
  18996: 'Hmm... Just like I thought, making the ${item-singular: 0[2]} caused the shield''s Craftsmanship to decrease.${prompt}'
  18997: Make sure you take good care of this item so you don't have to go through the whole process again.${prompt}
  18998: Look at the brilliant design of this shield. You can tell its quality just by looking at it. Of course, I expected nothing less from you.${prompt}
  18999: Furthermore, I can tell this shield's power is well beyond the previous one. Of course, it's still probably not enough for her though.${prompt}
  19000: Now, let me mark it for you to complete the process.${prompt}
  19001: There you go. Show the shield to Mewk Chorosap and you'll be finished.${prompt}
  19002: Don't worry, these things happen. Go and try the last objective one more time.${prompt}
  19003: It is nice to see you. Let's not waste any time. I shall teach you the new recipe.${prompt}
  19004: Hm? You already know the recipe and how to obtain some of the ingredients?${prompt}
  19005: 'I guess that just leaves the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}. As such...${prompt}'
  19006: Our guild has received a number of orders for some items, but they need to be crafted in front of the customer.${prompt}
  19007: You see, the customer wants to see our finest craftsmen at work up close and personal.${prompt}
  19008: There are some exceptions, but otherwise only items crafted near the customer will count.${prompt}
  19009: I also need you to gather the materials needed to craft the items. You're free to obtain them however you like.${prompt}
  19010: On that note, we have reached an agreement between the guilds that will let you use gil to buy certain items from each one that were not previously available.${prompt}
  19011: You can buy them from the crafting set vendor in each guild.${prompt}
  19012: However, each guild is free to set its own rules, so know that you might not always find what you are looking for.${prompt}
  19013: 'Once you have completed all of the requests, I will give you the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}.${prompt}'
  19014: 'This is the ${choice: 0}[first/next/final] request.${prompt}'
  19015: 'Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Morunaude at Justi''s Furniture in ${unknown: 0x01053782E78180}.${prompt}'

    Will you see this through?

  19027: I guess it cannot be helped. I shall find somebody else to finish this task.${prompt}
  19028: There are plenty more requests for you to handle, so please come back after you get some rest.${prompt}
  19029: So, are you feeling better now? I have the next request here if you want it.${prompt}
  19030: Oh, it seems you completed the delivery. Thank you for the help.${prompt}
  19031: Ahh, you have completed all of the deliveries. I really appreciate your help.${prompt}
  19032: 'Here are the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${item-singular: 1[2]} as promised.${prompt}'
  19033: I am sure you will never face such a problem, but if you lose either of these items, you can use guild points to obtain a replacement.${prompt}
  19034: I really have gotten quite good at this.${prompt}
  19035: So this is how the shield turned out...${prompt}
  19036: Yes, it really is quite beautiful! I can see your skill continues to grow without bounds.${prompt}
  19037: Our friend thinks that the next upgrade will be the one to unlock the true power of the shield. I cannot wait to see what it becomes.${prompt}
  19038: Oh, wait a moment. I have a crafting technique that I think would be just perfect for one of your ability. Give it a try when you have a chance.${prompt}
  19039: It's good of you to come. It looks like you're nearly finished upgrading the shield.${prompt}
  19040: Now, please allow me to explain what comes next.${prompt}
  19041: 'I have prepared the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and ${item-singular: 3[2]} that you will require.${prompt}'
  19042: If you have enough crafter points, you can exchange them with Luren right away.${prompt}
  19043: 'As for the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, the procedure is the same as before. Let me see your shield after you boost its Craftsmanship to 100%.${prompt}'
  19044: That's it for my explanation. Your first goal should be to work on getting that Craftsmanship value up. Good luck to you.${prompt}
  19045: 'With the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, Mewk Chorosap mentioned that she wanted it brought to her. Try to deliver it as soon as possible.${prompt}'
  19046: Hello. What do you need?${prompt}
  19047: Ah! You must be talking about the item that Tarutaru from Adoulin asked me to make.${prompt}
  19048: I was asked to send it to Jeuno after it was completed.${prompt}
  19049: I imagine it must've been delivered to Mewk Chorosap by now.${prompt}
  19050: Hello again. I have something to tell you. Do you remember that item you were looking for? I found it in the guild.${prompt}
  19051: Hm? You need it for something? Sure, that's fine with me. Consider it yours.${prompt}
  19052: Hmm... That emblem...${prompt}
  19053: Ahh, I see. You've finished the shield at last. It looks absolutely amazing!${prompt}
  19054: When you equip it, everyone will know that you're a top-level member of the Carpenters' Guild.${prompt}
  19055: One more thing... I have prepared something for you in honor of your achievement.${prompt}
  19056: I look forward to seeing you develop your woodworking skills and create breathtaking new items that have never been seen before.${prompt}
  19057: '0: ${number: 0} 1: ${number: 1} 2: ${number: 2} 3: ${number: 3}${prompt}'
  19058: Oh, greetings, my friend. Ahh, what's that shield you're holding?${prompt}
  19059: Hmm... It looks like you've had an audience with her.${prompt}
  19060: I heard the story of course. Supposedly, the shield can enhance a craftsman's abilities. I don't pretend to fathom how it works though.${prompt}
  19061: Although, if the stories are accurate, then I suppose I should probably try to learn more about it.${prompt}
  19062: I know as well as anybody how skilled you are. So if she chose you for this task, then I suppose you must have what it takes to make this shield.${prompt}
  19063: So then, shall we get started? First, I'll need to tell you the recipe. This is important, so try not to forget it.${prompt}
  19064: 'So, in order to complete the process, you''ll require ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  19065: 'Essentially, this enables you to bring the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its maximum value.${prompt}'
  19066: I received these writings which cover the topic of Craftsmanship in finer detail. If you will allow me to read them to you...${prompt}
  19067: I hope you were able to comprehend that information to a satisfactory nature.${prompt}
  19068: 'Once the Craftsmanship rating is high enough, please come show it to me. I''ll create the ${item-singular: 1[2]} that you require.${prompt}'
  19069: 'Next, you''ll require ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. You will find that you can obtain them from Ore Guzzler.${prompt}'
  19070: I believe you have made deliveries for people before, yes? That is essentially what you will need to do here.${prompt}
  19071: You may speak to Ore Guzzler for more information on the subject.${prompt}
  19072: Those are the ingredients you will require. I ask that you show me the shield when it is finished. I am interested to see it with my own eyes.${prompt}
  19073: Are you trying to tell me that you've forgotten the recipe already? Very well. Here is the list again. Please do try to remember it.${prompt}
  19074: I was known for being quite talented in my day, yet even I must admit that you have surpassed me. I have faith that you will be able to complete this task.${prompt}
  19075: 'I see... With this, I can create the ${item-singular: 0[2]} that you require.${prompt}'
  19076: 'So, this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  19077: The technique used to pour my soul into this shield and form a crystal is quite amazing. It is quite beyond my meager understanding.${prompt}
  19078: 'Hmm... It would appear that in creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, we seem to have lowered the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  19079: 'That is not a problem if you wish to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but if you wish to create the ${item-singular: 0[2]} again, you will need to raise the Craftsmanship once more.${prompt}'
  19080: I know that you of all people would never lose something as important as this though.${prompt}
  19081: 'Are you trying to tell me that you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  19082: 'Very well. I can make you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Let me see your shield.${prompt}'
  19083: You are supposed to be a professional. You must learn to take better care of your ingredients.${prompt}
  19084: It would appear that you have successfully made the upgrade. Do you mind if I take a look?${prompt}
  19085: Hmm... I can tell that it looks different, and can even feel its power. However, it does not seem to be finished yet.${prompt}
  19086: I'm sure you've probably heard, but you'll need to craft it multiple times in order to bring out its true potential.${prompt}
  19087: Oh, I almost forgot. You require some kind of proof that the work on the shield was finished. Please give me a moment.${prompt}
  19088: That should do it.${prompt}
  19089: Show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.${prompt}
  19090: By the way, I am always scheduling deliveries to Ore Guzzler. Please stop by and help out the guild if you get a chance.${prompt}
  19091: I have been waiting for your return. She told me about your task this time.${prompt}
  19092: First, you will need the recipe. This is important, so I do hope you can remember it.${prompt}
  19093: That's the recipe.${prompt}
  19094: 'The first ingredient you need to obtain is the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  19095: 'Does that name sound familiar? It should, you have used it before. This time, you''ll need to craft while equipping the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  19096: By doing so, the shield's Craftsmanship will gradually increase, just like last time.${prompt}
  19097: 'Once it reaches 100%, come bring it to me. We will be able to use the shield to obtain the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  19098: 'The next ingredient on the list is the ${item-singular: 3[2]}. I hope you haven''t forgotten this one either. I have given it along with the ${item-singular: 2[2]} to Ore Guzzler.${prompt}'
  19099: 'The final ingredient you''ll need is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}, but for it, I needed to enlist the help of the A.M.A.N. They''ve prepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you to complete.${prompt}'
  19100: 'You may refer to the Records of Eminence menu for more details. Once you have completed all of the objectives, you can get the ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt}'
  19101: That completes my explanation. Your technique is nearly equal to that of my own. As long as you are not overly confident, I have faith that you can complete this task.${prompt}
  19102: Very well, let's see what you have there.${prompt}
  19103: 'Yes, quite impressive. Now, I will prepare the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  19104: Haha. Once again, it seems we have a rather magnificent crystal on our hands.${prompt}
  19105: 'Hmm... It appears that like before, the shield''s Craftsmanship drops when producing the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  19106: It is no easy task to increase the shield's Craftsmanship. That is why I am certain you would never do anything foolish like lose this thing, right?${prompt}
  19107: Yes, this turned out quite impressive. I can see that you approached this task with the utmost seriousness.${prompt}
  19108: In fact, you can feel the increased power from this shield compared to the previous one. I am anxious to see how powerful it can become.${prompt}
  19109: Now, let me get you that marking you require.${prompt}
  19110: There you go. Simply show this marking to Mewk Chorosap and you will be done.${prompt}
  19111: 'I suppose these things happen. Very well. You can attempt the final objective one more time. Once you clear it, I will give you the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  19112: Oh, it's you again. I suppose you are here about the shield.${prompt}
  19113: I can see that you have already heard about the recipe and how to obtain some of the materials.${prompt}
  19114: 'You just need to learn about the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}, I suppose. Very well then.${prompt}'
  19115: The Blacksmiths' Guild has received a number of orders for various items recently, but the items need to be made in the customer's presence.${prompt}
  19116: It's the customer's personal request, so I suppose it is in order to keep an eye on the final quality. The customers sure are getting picky lately, but that's the cost of doing business.${prompt}
  19117: So they will only accept what they can see you craft. However, an exception is made for items such as those used for repairs. You can simply deliver them directly without any problems.${prompt}
  19118: I also need you to gather the materials needed to make the items. I do not care how you obtain them.${prompt}
  19119: Oh, one more thing. An agreement was recently formed between the guilds enabling you to purchase some items that were previously unavailable, assuming you can afford them that is.${prompt}
  19120: You can speak to the crafting set vendor in each guild to see which items are available. It may prove quite useful in your endeavors.${prompt}
  19121: However, each guild plays by its own rules. You may or may not find what it is you need. Be sure to keep that in mind.${prompt}
  19122: 'Once you have completed all of the requests, come see me and I will give you the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}.${prompt}'
  19123: 'This is the ${choice: 0}[first/next/final] request.${prompt}'
