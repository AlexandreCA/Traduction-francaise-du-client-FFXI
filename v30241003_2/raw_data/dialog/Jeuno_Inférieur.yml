    Yes, yes, trust is good for the soul.
    Now, if you'll allow me, hee hee hee...${prompt}
  7132: The deed is done. The rest is up to you to wield it as you have thus far.${prompt}
  7133: An invisible, mystical energy resides within your weapon. I would explain the n-n-nature of this energy in more detail, but I fear it is beyond the comprehension of a layperson.${prompt}
  7134: Wh-what? You doubt my kn-kn-knowledge on the subject!?${prompt}
  7135: Hmph. I won't deny that research is still ongoing. I do know, however, that those who venture deeper within the Nyzul Isle develop g-g-greater affinity with these artifacts.${prompt}
  7136: 'So indeed, if you''ve already come to be in p-p-possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you can expect stupendous results.${prompt}'
  7137: Note, though, that I have merely awakened your weapon from its long s-s-slumber. You must, through usage, accumulate said energy to the point of saturation.${prompt}
  7138: With that accomplished, a m-m-most extraordinary evolution will take place.${prompt}
  7139: When that happens, bring the weapon to me. I promise it'll be a profitable v-v-venture for you...and yours truly, too. Ahee hee hee...${prompt}
  7140: When you sense a ch-ch-change has occurred within your weapon, bring it to me. I promise you won't regret it.${prompt}

    Hmm...
    I sense only a mote of energy p-p-present. You still have a long way to go, it seems.${prompt}

  7163: Alors, vous êtes le nouvel attaché diplomatique. Quoi, vous avez un message secret de l'archiduc ? Voyons cela.${prompt}
  7164: Je vois. Merci de m'avoir apporté cela. Il dit que je dois vous parler du magicite.${prompt}
  7165: Le magicite se trouve dans les profondeurs du Château d'Oztroja, Davoi et Beadeaux. Mais ces lieux sont remplis de monstres, et ces monstres sont assez rusés.${prompt}
  7166: Vous aurez besoin de ça pour entrer dans Beadeaux.${prompt}
  7167: Aldo...${prompt}
  7168: Que se passe-t-il, Verena ? Tu ne vois pas que j'ai un invité ?${prompt}
  7169: Je sais. C'est justement à propos de ça.${prompt}
  7170: J'ai entendu dire que l'archiduc a fait une déclaration...${prompt}
  7171: Il a ordonné que tous les monstres soient expulsés de Jeuno. Il ne doit plus penser qu'il est sûr de les garder ici.${prompt}
  7172: Quoi ? Je pense que ces types au palais sont bien pires que tous les monstres qu'on a ici !${prompt}
  7173: C'est comme s'ils portaient des masques... on ne peut pas deviner ce qu'ils pensent. Et leurs yeux sont comme des pierres froides. Tu ne vas pas obéir à cet ordre, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7174: Eh bien, je comprends ce que tu ressens, mais avec les monstres déchaînés dehors, on ne peut pas en vouloir aux gens de se méfier de ceux qui sont ici.${prompt}
  7175: Tu as entendu parler de tout ça, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7176: Oui, j'en ai entendu parler. Mais les monstres en ville n'ont jamais fait de mal à personne !${prompt}
  7177: Je le sais, Verena... Mais je ne pense pas que le Jeunoan moyen serait d'accord.${prompt}
  7178: Non...${prompt}
  7179: C'est peut-être la décision la plus sage. Tu sais, agir avant que les choses ne dégénèrent.${prompt}
  7180: Bon, je vais voir si je peux trouver une meilleure alternative. Ne t'inquiète pas. Je serais le dernier à les chasser de la ville.${prompt}
  7181: D'accord. Tu as promis, tu te souviens !${prompt}

  7188: Bon, d'accord. Allons-y alors !${prompt}
  7189: Euh, d'accord.${prompt}
  7190: Le magicite se trouve dans les profondeurs du Château d'Oztroja, Davoi et Beadeaux. Ces endroits sont infestés de monstres meurtriers, et leurs pièges sont rusés.${prompt}
  7191: Il n'y a pas de rumeur qui ne finisse par arriver à Jeuno. Je parie que tu peux trouver ce qu'il te faut auprès d'autres aventuriers. Que ta force ne faiblisse jamais !${prompt}
  7192: Quoi ? Tu dis que les monstres préparent peut-être autre chose ? Ouais, ce ne serait pas comme eux de simplement abandonner.${prompt}
  7193: Je ne veux plus rien avoir à faire avec les monstres. Je parie que le vieux Gobelin Muckvix en sait plus, mais il faudra que tu lui demandes toi-même.${prompt}
  7194: Verena est vraiment inquiète pour Fickblix. Mieux vaut ne pas parler de monstres près d'elle.${prompt}
  7195: Je me demande qui est le pire, nous ou eux ? Fickie n'a jamais fait de mal à personne.${prompt}
  7196: Ce n'est pas parce qu'ils ne sont pas humains qu'on doit les détester. Même un gamin comme Fickie est traité comme de la merde.${prompt}
  7197: Je ne sais plus ce qui est bien ou mal. Je ne peux aider personne. Désolé.${prompt}
  7198: Quoi ? Les graines de Fickie ont commencé à pousser ? Eh, qu'est-ce que ça a à voir avec moi, hein ?${prompt}
  7199: Bien sûr que je n'aime pas la guerre. Mais ce n'est pas la même chose.${prompt}
  7200: Hé, je suis un monstre. Je ne te dirai rien si ça nuit à mon peuple.${prompt}

  7202: Aldo, je...${prompt}
  7203: Verena, j'ai entendu dire que tes fleurs ont commencé à germer. Je parie que vous les enfants avez bien arrosé. Ce genre de graine ne prend pas racine facilement.${prompt}
  7204: Peut-être que tout ce que toi et Fickblix avez accompli a vraiment signifié quelque chose.${prompt}
  7205: Récemment, je... je ne les ai pas arrosées. Je n'ai pensé qu'à moi-même. Je suis tellement désolée, Fickie.${prompt}
  7206: Ouais, peut-être que ce n'est pas une question de ce qui est bien ou mal.${prompt}
  7207: Rien ne serait mieux que d'éviter un autre conflit... Pour nous, et pour eux.${prompt}
  7208: D'accord ! Je ne sais pas ce qu'on peut faire, mais je vais aider. Fickie ne nous pardonnerait jamais si on restait silencieux.${prompt}
  7209: C'est vrai ! Le moins qu'on puisse faire, c'est essayer.${prompt}
  7210: Mais je ne sais pas si on pourra découvrir ce qu'ils mijotent.${prompt}
  7211: Je suppose qu'on pourrait demander à Muckvix.${prompt}
  7212: Mais est-ce qu'il aidera ? Il essaie toujours de rester à l'écart de ces histoires raciales.${prompt}
  7213: Et s'il nous disait quoi que ce soit, il trahirait son propre peuple.${prompt}
  7214: Ouais, je sais. Mais il n'y a rien d'autre qu'on puisse faire. ${name-player}, ça te dérange de demander à Muckvix ? On y va plus tard.${prompt}
  7215: Hé, je n'ai rien à te dire. Dégage.${prompt}
  7216: On a besoin de ton aide aussi, Muckvix.${prompt}
  7217: Oh, alors tu es dans le coup, hein ? Qu'est-ce que tu veux encore ?${prompt}
  7218: S'il te plaît, Muck. Tu es notre seul espoir. Jeuno—non, le monde entier est en danger à moins que tu nous dises.${prompt}
  7219: Hé, je vis ici depuis des lustres, mais au fond, je ne suis qu'un monstre, hein ?${prompt}
  7220: Tu n'auras rien de moi. Tu vois, nous les monstres, on est tous des frères.${prompt}
  7221: Muck, tu ne nous considères pas comme les tiens, mais ces enfants et moi avons aidé les graines de Fickie à pousser... Pour nous, les hommes et les monstres, c'est pareil. On est tous un et pareil !${prompt}
  7222: Et maintenant, la chance pour la paix est en danger. S'il te plaît, Muck, dis-nous !${prompt}
  7223: Chance pour la paix, hein ? Ah, ce Fickie... Que ferait-il s'il était ici ?${prompt}
  7224: Ah, tant pis. Mais juste cette fois ! Et seulement parce que je dois une faveur à ton père. Que mes peuples me pardonnent...${prompt}
  7225: Bon, alors l'équipe que vous cherchez a toujours été un peu froide avec nous.${prompt}
  7226: Ce sont juste une bande de durs, mais parfois ils pètent un câble. J'ai entendu dire qu'ils se forment en un gros groupe, alors ils doivent comploter quelque chose !${prompt}
  7227: Essaie de chercher autour de la Nécropole d'Eldieme. J'ai entendu dire que les paumés qui ont quitté Davoi se cachent là-bas. Et je ne dirai rien de plus !${prompt}

  7423: As-tu entendu parler de Lewenhart ?${prompt}
  7424: Partout où il va, des mélodies fantastiques le suivent. Il est le barde de tous les bardes, une légende parmi les nôtres.${prompt}
  7425: Il devrait encore errer quelque part, mais personne ne l'a vu depuis des lustres.${prompt}
  7426: Quelqu'un de sa stature pourrait facilement s'installer et vivre confortablement. Peut-être qu'il errera toute sa vie. Qui sait ce que pense un esprit créatif comme le sien ?${prompt}

  7428: Quoi ? Tu pourrais être un si bon barde ! À quoi penses-tu ? Nous pourrions apporter tant d'harmonie à ce monde !${prompt}

  7431: Peu importe combien le monde change, les gens restent les mêmes. Oh, comme j'aimerais être aimée comme ça...${prompt}
  7432: Bon, de toute façon... Je parie que ces paroles amères remonteraient vraiment le moral à ceux qui ont le cœur brisé.${prompt}
  7433: Oh, tu es allé à Buburimu ? Ils disent que les couples envahissent cet endroit à la tombée de la nuit. Comment échappent-ils aux monstres ?${prompt}
  7434: Et tu sais quoi ? Il y a un autre ensemble de runes à Valkurm... avec l'autre partie des paroles ! C'est un endroit fabuleux pour un rendez-vous ; crois-moi.${prompt}
  7435: Quand tu lis les paroles à Buburimu après avoir vu celles de Valkurm, les larmes reviennent à nouveau. Oh, les chansons tristes sont si émouvantes !${prompt}
  7436: Oh, tu es barde aussi ? Alors, viens plus souvent !${prompt}
  7437: Dis, tu devrais être un barde. À quoi penses-tu ?${prompt}
  7438: Tu vois ! Cet homme près de la table semble plein de vie, non ? Bien sûr, il n'y a pas longtemps, je ne me serais jamais tenu près de lui !${prompt}

  7440: Allons, mon jeune ami. À quoi bon tout ce bruit ? Viens, laisse-moi t'offrir quelque chose.${prompt}
  7441: Je pensais que tu étais comme moi, un homme qui vit pour la chanson et la danse. Me suis-je trompé ?${prompt}
  7442: Qui es-tu ? Laisse-moi tranquille !${prompt}
  7443: Oh, voyons... Ah, tu parlais de cette chanson. C'est un super morceau, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7444: Non, ce n'est pas vrai ! Personne ne se soucie d'une vieille comme ça.${prompt}
  7445: Eh bien, désolé, mais l'as-tu déjà essayée ? Ce n'est pas parce qu'elle est vieille qu'elle n'est pas bonne, tu sais.${prompt}
  7446: Hmm...${prompt}
  7447: Vas-y, essaie. Qu’as-tu à perdre ?${prompt}
  7448: Ça fait plaisir de te revoir.${prompt}

  7452: Attends, pourrait-il être...? Nah, c’est impossible.${prompt}
  7453: C’est toi ! Merci infiniment !${prompt}
  7454: J’avais perdu toute confiance en la vie. Mais grâce à toi, je pense à ces beaux mots gravés dans la pierre chaque fois que je suis triste.${prompt}

  7466: Eh, qu’est-ce que tu insinues ? Je t’ai jamais demandé d’y aller, moi.${prompt}
  7467: Je jouais juste avec Verena, mais elle est déprimée. Et je sais pourquoi.${prompt}
  7468: Les monstres à l’extérieur de la ville deviennent agités. Ça rend Verena inquiète. Alors je vais aller à Oztroja et leur demander de se calmer.${prompt}
  7469: Je pense que les monstres dehors peuvent s’entendre avec les gens, comme moi avec Verena. J’y crois vraiment.${prompt}
  7470: Oui, tu n’as peut-être pas tort.${prompt}
  7471: Eh bien, j’y vais.${prompt}
  7472: Eh, Fickie...${prompt}
  7473: Oui, Muck ?${prompt}
  7474: Fais attention, là-bas.${prompt}
  7475: Ça ira. Ils m’écouteront.${prompt}
  7476: Oui, ma génération ne peut pas oublier la guerre, donc c’est vraiment difficile de comprendre.${prompt}
  7477: Mais vous, les jeunes, vous ne vous souvenez de rien de tout ça. Alors je pense que vous pouvez combler le fossé. Oui, pour nous tous !${prompt}
  7478: Fickie ? Est-ce que Fickie est ici ?${prompt}
  7479: Eh, tu viens juste de le manquer. Il a dit quelque chose sur le fait d’aller au château d’Oztroja. Tu ne l’as pas croisé en arrivant ?${prompt}
  7480: Non, c’est juste... Des aventuriers ont dit qu’ils allaient chasser les hommes-bêtes, alors j’ai eu tellement peur…${prompt}
  7481: Je lui ai toujours dit de rester ici en ville. Je lui ai dit que si les gens le trouvaient dans un donjon, ils pourraient le prendre pour un mauvais homme-bête, et alors ils...${prompt}
  7482: Tu n’y peux rien. Ce gamin est une créature, et même les gens de cette ville nous rejettent.${prompt}
  7483: Eh bien, il n’a pas vraiment sa place dehors non plus... Mais je pense qu’il est plus en sécurité là-bas qu’ici.${prompt}
  7484: Je suis tellement inquiète pour lui.${prompt}
  7485: Cette fille comprend des choses que seuls nous, les créatures, comprenons. Peut-être que Fickie et elle pourront briser les barrières qui nous séparent.${prompt}
  7486: J’espère juste qu’ils se méfient de ces types avides de ce pouvoir mystérieux.${prompt}
  7487: Oups... Eh, oublie ça.${prompt}
  7488: Eh, Fickie est juste un étranger ici. Maintenant, il n’a pas vraiment sa place dehors non plus, mais je pense qu’ils le traiteront mieux.${prompt}

  7745: J'ai hâte de voir leur sélection de bijoux fins et d'accessoires. Je ne rentrerai pas chez moi tant que je ne l'aurai pas trouvée !${prompt}
  7746: On dit qu'elle peut être trouvée “juste sous ton nez”. Mais qu'est-ce qu'ils veulent dire par là ?${prompt}
  7747: 'Oh, oui... J’ai vu des gens passer ${item-plural: 0[2]} à la réception ici, mais ils ne veulent pas me dire d’où ils viennent. Où puis-je en trouver un ?${prompt}'
  7748: Quoi ? Tu es membre de Tenshodo maintenant, toi aussi ? Et tu ne vas même pas me donner une invitation ? Tu oses !${prompt}
  7749: Je n'en crois pas mes oreilles ! Bon, tant pis ! Je vais en trouver un moi-même !${prompt}
  7750: De grands ponts datant des temps anciens traversent le détroit en dessous. Jeuno a simplement surgi au sommet de leurs ruines.${prompt}
  7751: Personne ne sait comment — ni même pourquoi — nos ancêtres ont construit ces ponts. Bien sûr, ça ne nous empêche pas de vivre nos vies dessus.${prompt}
  7752: Et c'est un excellent moyen de briser la glace avec des inconnus, tu ne trouves pas ?${prompt}
  7753: J'ai entendu dire que Jeuno a commencé il y a environ quatre-vingts ans, quand des pêcheurs se sont installés ici. C'était juste un petit village de pêcheurs à l'époque.${prompt}
  7754: Comme tu peux le voir sur n'importe quelle carte, Jeuno se trouve à un carrefour qui lie les trois nations. Un centre de commerce, Jeuno est devenu riche.${prompt}
  7755: Bientôt, c'était rempli de l'agitation des acheteurs et des vendeurs. Notre humble quartier capture cette énergie particulière mieux que n'importe quel autre.${prompt}
  7756: Hein ? Qu'est-ce que je fais ici ? Je cherche du travail ! J'ai été viré de mon dernier endroit. Un truc avec le fait que je parle trop...${prompt}
  7757: “Ne pas déranger”${prompt}
  7758: On vient juste de faire lire notre compatibilité par cette diseuse de bonne aventure là-bas...${prompt}
  7759: Tu ne vas pas y croire. Zéro compatibilité ! Je pensais qu'on était faits l'un pour l'autre !${prompt}
  7760: Allez, chérie... Ce n'est qu'une voyance ! Allez, sois un peu plus joyeuse, d'accord ?${prompt}
  7761: Elle ne veut rien entendre. Je ferais attention avec les voyances si j'étais toi.${prompt}
  7762: Hé ! Je suis en train de changer !${prompt}
  7763: Oh, mon dieu... Il y en a tellement à choisir ! Je ne sais pas quoi prendre. Au fait, tu penses que ça me va bien ?${prompt}
  7764: Je ne pense pas. J'ai besoin de quelque chose qui saute aux yeux et qui crie “moi”. Hmm... Que choisir...${prompt}
  7765: Oh, j'adore les bijoux. Je pourrais rester à regarder des diamants toute la journée. Pourquoi les hommes ne comprennent-ils pas ça ?${prompt}
  7766: Pourquoi les femmes deviennent-elles folles pour les diamants ? Je ne comprends pas du tout.${prompt}
  7767: Elle s'amuse, donc ça va. Je souhaite juste qu'elle se dépêche à choisir quelque chose !${prompt}
  7768: Les gobelins dirigent cette boutique, mais ne t'inquiète pas. Ils ne sont pas hostiles. Je suppose qu'ils ne sont pas tous pareils...${prompt}
  7769: J'aime bien la diversité, mais j'ai des frissons rien qu'en y entrant. Pourtant, ils ont des choses qu'on ne trouve nulle part ailleurs.${prompt}
  7770: Cette boutique est célèbre parmi les locaux pour les trois belles femmes derrière le comptoir. Laquelle est ma préférée ? Eh bien, c'est un secret.${prompt}
  7771: Je me demande laquelle est la plus jolie du point de vue d'une femme...${prompt}
  7772: Hmm... Alors tu préfères la beauté classique. Ne le dis à personne, mais moi aussi je la préfère.${prompt}
  7773: Waouh, donc tu préfères les femmes plus âgées, hein ? Tu aimes une femme qui prend les choses en main... Eh bien, elle est vraiment superbe.${prompt}
  7774: Waouh, donc tu es attiré par le type pur et innocent, hein ? Oui, elle est vraiment mignonne.${prompt}
  7775: Je ne dois jamais, jamais le dire à personne. Personne ne peut savoir à quel point je paraissais gros quand j'ai acheté une taille trop petite...${prompt}
  7776: Hein ? Non ! Je ne voulais pas dire ça ! Regarde, j'ai acheté quelque chose que je ne pouvais pas porter pour mon travail actuel ! Il faut toujours faire attention à ça, tu sais. Ahahaha !${prompt}
  7777: Collet n'est pas allé à l'école depuis un moment ! J'espère qu'elle va bien.${prompt}
  7778: Galmut lui dit toujours, “Laisse faire, c'est moi qui m'en occupe.” Mais qu'est-ce que ça peut être ? J'espère qu'elle reviendra vite.${prompt}

  7781: Nous nous trouvons actuellement à Bas Jeuno, au troisième niveau depuis le haut.${prompt}
  7782: J'avais l'habitude de regarder le port rempli de navires. Mais depuis l'arrivée des dirigeables, ces jours sont révolus.${prompt}
  7783: Le progrès est une bonne chose, mais c'est tout de même triste.${prompt}
  7784: Je cherche l'endroit parfait pour pêcher. Le problème, c'est que cela fait si longtemps que je cherche, que je n'ai plus le temps de pêcher !${prompt}
  7785: J'ai acheté une maison ici à Jeuno, mais j'aurais aimé savoir pour ce horrible bar en bas. Chaque nuit, ces bardes font la fête jusqu'à l'aube. Que dois-je faire ?${prompt}
  7786: Jeuno est une ville spéciale. Nous sommes un melting-pot de toutes sortes de gens. J'adore cette ville.${prompt}
  7787: Bien sûr, parfois nous ne comprenons pas à quel point nous sommes tous différents. C'est justement ce genre de chose qu'il faut éviter.${prompt}
  7788: J'aime me tenir ici et regarder les gens courir partout toute la journée. Je me demande quelle est cette urgence...${prompt}
  7789: Parfois, il faudrait ralentir et marcher un peu. Vous savez, s'arrêter et sentir les rrroses !${prompt}
  7790: Bonjour et bienvenue à Bas Jeuno. Notre quartier est la destination commerciale phare de la ville, avec une large gamme de marchandises.${prompt}
  7791: Nous espérons que vous apprécierez l'expérience unique de shopping de Bas Jeuno. Quoi, vous attendiez quelqu'un de plus jeune ? Allez, partez !${prompt}
  7792: Pour moi, l'enchère, c'est comme un jeu d'esprit entre moi et les autres enchérisseurs.${prompt}
  7793: Il faut toujours garder un œil sur ce que l'on veut vraiment, et combien on est prêt à payer pour cela. C'est tellement facile de se laisser emporter !${prompt}
  7794: Quand j'étais une jeune fille, je suivais souvent mon amoureux jusqu'à cette fontaine. Il ne disait presque rien, il était si timide !${prompt}
  7795: Aimer quelqu'un est une chose merveilleuse. C'est seulement maintenant, à mon âge, que cela me semble si évident.${prompt}
  7796: Oh, mon mari ? Oui, il va très bien. Il est tellement plein de vie, je ne sais même plus quoi faire !${prompt}
  7797: Vous devez examiner toutes les publicités pour trouver les meilleures offres !${prompt}
  7798: La différence entre ces magasins peut être minime, mais je suis toujours ravi d'économiser quelques gil. Oh, quel avare je suis !${prompt}
  7799: La capacité de votre inventaire a augmenté.${prompt}
  7800: Nous offrons désormais une livraison rapide et facile des colis à toutes les résidences !${prompt}
  7801: Tu ne mérites pas encore un sac plus grand... pas encore.${prompt}
  7802: J'enseigne aux membres de Tenshodo l'art du poing et du pied. Dans leur travail, il arrive qu'ils doivent se défendre, vous voyez.${prompt}
  7803: Je ferais attention si j'étais vous. Mettez votre nez dans des affaires qui ne vous concernent pas, et vous pourriez vous attirer des ennuis.${prompt}
  7804: 'Eh bien, eh bien... Je vois que tu as obtenu ton ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Mais tu as encore besoin de plus d’entraînement, enfant. Tu dois atteindre le rang de ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'

  7813: Tu t'appelles ${name-player} ? Eh bien, je n'ai jamais entendu parler de toi. Peut-être que tu es quelqu'un dans ton petit village, mais ici, les choses sont différentes.${prompt}
  7814: Toutes les routes mènent à Jeuno. Ce n'est pas facile de se faire un nom parmi tout ce monde.${prompt}
  7815: Si tu es vraiment si célèbre chez toi, alors la nouvelle finira par arriver ici. Pour l'instant, termine ce que tu as commencé. La gloire et la fortune suivront.${prompt}
  7816: ${name-player}, hein ? Hmm... Ce nom me dit vaguement quelque chose...${prompt}
  7817: Mais j'ai bien peur que peu de gens dans cette ville aient entendu parler de toi. Continue de travailler, tu finiras par te faire un nom.${prompt}
  7818: Oh, donc tu es ${name-player}... Oui, j'ai entendu des voyageurs dans une taverne parler de toi. Il semble que tu aies une réputation assez correcte.${prompt}
  7819: Si tu continues comme ça, je suis sûr que plus de Jeunoans viendront chercher ton aide. Bonne chance.${prompt}
  7820: Bonjour, ${name-player}! J'entends souvent parler de toi ces jours-ci. Tu as bien travaillé, mon ami. Continue ainsi.${prompt}
  7821: Bonjour, ${name-player}! Beaucoup de gens ici à Jeuno te connaissent !${prompt}
  7822: Et ils disent tous que tu es vraiment un bienfaiteur ! Merci de servir notre belle ville. Continue ton excellent travail !${prompt}
  7823: Tiens, c'est ${name-player} ! Ta réputation grandissante te précède.${prompt}
  7824: Nous espérons que tes contributions déjà substantielles à notre humble ville continueront de croître avec le temps.${prompt}
  7825: Tiens, bonjour, ${name-player}. Je dirais que littéralement tout le monde à Jeuno connaît ton nom.${prompt}
  7826: C'est avec plaisir que je t'informe de combien nous sommes impressionnés par ton service à Jeuno. Nous espérons voir davantage de ta générosité louable dans le futur !${prompt}

    Bienvenue à l'hôtel des ventes.
    Avez-vous des questions sur notre établissement ?${prompt}
  7830: |-
    Que voulez-vous savoir ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Qu'est-ce que l'hôtel des ventes ?
    Comment se déroulent les enchères ?
    Y a-t-il des frais ?
    Y a-t-il des limites ?
    Comment vérifier les marchandises ?
    Comment retirer un objet ?
    Ma liste “État des ventes” est pleine !
    Rien pour le moment.${prompt}
  7831: Les hôtels des ventes se trouvent dans toutes les grandes villes de Vana'diel. Les aventuriers s'y rassemblent pour enchérir sur des butins, des objets indésirables, des vieilles armures... presque n'importe quoi.${prompt}
  7832: Actuellement, les hôtels des ventes de Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst et Jeuno fonctionnent indépendamment. Par conséquent, les prix varient d'une ville à l'autre.${prompt}
  7833: Les aventuriers peuvent utiliser n'importe quel hôtel des ventes, quelle que soit leur nationalité.${prompt}
  7834: Le premier aventurier à enchérir au prix demandé ou au-dessus achètera automatiquement le produit.${prompt}
  7835: Une fois mis en vente, un article restera aux enchères pour un maximum de trente semaines temps de Vana'diel (neuf jours et demi en temps terrestre).${prompt}
  7836: Si l'article ne se vend pas dans ce délai, il sera renvoyé à la résidence actuelle du vendeur.${prompt}
  7837: Les frais de transaction sont proportionnels au montant pour lequel un article est mis en vente. La méthode de calcul diffère pour les objets uniques et les objets empilables.${prompt}
  7838: Des frais de transaction sont prélevés lorsqu'un article est mis aux enchères. Ces frais ne sont pas remboursables.${prompt}
  7839: Le Comité International des Hôtels des Ventes, ou CIHV, a décrété qu'un maximum de sept articles peut être mis en vente en même temps.${prompt}
  7840: Cependant, le CIHV a récemment supprimé la limite du nombre d'articles qu'on peut acheter.${prompt}
  7841: Un petit délai est nécessaire avant que de nouvelles marchandises apparaissent sur la liste des enchères.${prompt}
  7842: Lorsqu'un article apparaît sur votre liste "État des ventes", il peut ne pas être immédiatement visible dans la liste des enchères. Si vous ne voyez pas votre article, réessayez plus tard.${prompt}
  7843: Si vous souhaitez retirer un article d'une vente aux enchères, vous devez vous rendre à l'hôtel des ventes et sélectionner "Arrêter la vente" dans le menu "État des ventes".${prompt}
  7844: Pour retirer un article de votre liste "État des ventes", vous devez vous rendre au comptoir des ventes pour confirmer la vente ou le retour de votre marchandise.${prompt}
  7845: Sinon, les articles précédemment vendus ou retournés rempliront votre liste et vous empêcheront de vendre davantage de marchandises.${prompt}
  7846: À n'importe quel comptoir des ventes, ouvrez le menu "État des ventes" et confirmez la transaction pour la retirer de la liste.${prompt}
  7847: Appuyez sur le bouton de confirmation pour retirer toute transaction colorée en jaune (vendu) ou en rouge (retourné).${prompt}
  7848: Y a-t-il autre chose que vous aimeriez savoir ?${prompt}
  7849: Par le passé, de nombreuses personnes ont amassé de grandes fortunes grâce aux hôtels des ventes. J'espère que la fortune vous sourira également !${prompt}

  7924: |-
    You really sure?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No, wait.${prompt}
  7925: Hey, ${choice-player-gender}[pal/sweetie]... You helped me out big time, but there ain't nothing more I can make for you.${prompt}
  7926: |-
    Do you have the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}?
    Vauderame asked for you...?${prompt}
  7927: |-
    Wait in that room over there.
    Everyone will be here momentarily.${prompt}
  7928: |-
    Well, ladies and gentlemen, are we all here?
    Allow me to introduce myself. I am Vauderame.${prompt}
  7929: I don't possess a talent for witty repartee as do most of my fellow Elvaan, so I will get straight to the point.${prompt}
  7930: Firstly, I wonder if you have heard of the group known as Atarefaunet's band?${prompt}
  7931: Also known as the Scarlet Thunder of La Theine, rrright?${prompt}
  7932: The Scarlet what?${prompt}
  7933: A bit before your time, young one? You need to study more.${prompt}
  7934: It was a group of thieves that once terrorized merchants on the roads between San d'Oria, Bastok, and Jeuno, stealing damn huge amounts of money and goods.${prompt}
  7935: '...Traveling merchants would quake in fear at the mere mention of that damn name...${prompt}'
  7936: It would seem the veterans among you are well-versed in thieving history.${prompt}
  7937: During the Great War, the leader of the band, Atarefaunet, was killed by a traitor and the rest of the members scattered to the winds.${prompt}
  7938: However, the Tenshodo has managed to divine the current whereabouts of the remaining members.${prompt}
  7939: 'The task I have called you here for today is to deliver a ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} to each of the thieves of Atarefaunet''s band.${prompt}'
  7940: |-
    Why would you want us to do that? Do you mean to bring them together to form a new thieving group?
    ...Damn!${prompt}
  7941: |-
    No, of course not.
    What could thieves of twenty years ago accomplish now?${prompt}
  7942: Nevertheless, it would not be wise to leave them to their own devices. It's possible that some amongst them might seek to regain the glory of the past.${prompt}
  7943: The Tenshodo simply wishes to measure their intentions. If those members plan on beginning any activities, we ask that they inform us about it.${prompt}
  7944: '...That is the main point of the message in the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  7945: However, it is not certain that they will just meekly sign the papers. My job is to make certain these brigands follow the will of the Tenshodo.${prompt}
  7946: And that is where you come in. Use your knowledge and talents to get those signatures and bring them back here to me.${prompt}
  7947: I will now hand each of you a sealed envelope. Seek out the member whose name is revealed therein.${prompt}
  7948: Lastly, it is against thieving etiquette to sneak a look at the members assigned to people other than yourself. As I'm sure you are aware, too much knowledge is a dangerous thing in this business...${prompt}
  7949: Now, please come to me one at a time to receive your envelope.${prompt}
  7950: You are the adventurer thief ${name-player}?${prompt}
  7951: Since you are an adventurer, I will give you the member who requires the most muscle to deal with. Go and meet with the Galka staying at the inn located in the town of Selbina.${prompt}
  7952: You have completed your assignment?${prompt}
  7953: Vauderame is waiting for you in the same room as before. Go and present your report.${prompt}
  7954: |-
    It appears the Galka gave you some trouble, as I expected.
    Your face tells of trying times.${prompt}
  7955: I'm ba-ack!${prompt}
  7956: Ah, Nanaa Mihgo, that makes everyone.${prompt}
  7957: |-
    Now, ${name-player}.
    Gather everyone together. It's time to begin.${prompt}
  7958: I thank you all for flawlessly completing the task I set.${prompt}
  7959: As a reward, I will give each of you a weapon designed specifically for thieves. Please come to me one at a time.${prompt}
  7960: Hey, we don't trust you people none, but we can always smell a profit!${prompt}
  7961: Hey, daredevil... You lookin' for Pauluart? He comes here lots.${prompt}
  7962: Let's roll some dice. Loser gets to see Pauluart and get killed.${prompt}
  7963: |-
    Roll the dice?
    ${selection-lines}
    Let's do it.
    Just a minute.${prompt}
  7964: '${color-alt: 121}You roll the die and get a ${number: 2}!'
  7965: '${color-alt: 121}Sniggnix rolls the die and gets a ${number: 3}!'
  7966: 'Here''s your chance. Go to Dangruf Wadi and find Dangruf brothers. They have ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  7967: Uh-oh.${prompt}
  7968: That ain't good.${prompt}
  7969: |-
    You got ${item-singular: 1[2]}.
    If you have that die, you win against Pauluart.${prompt}
  7970: If you lose, say, “Smaller number wins.”${prompt}
  7971: Wait outside. I go get Pauluart and come back.${prompt}
  7972: You were looking for me?${prompt}
  7973: |-
    You call yourself ${name-player}?
    I have no memory of that name. What do you want with me?${prompt}
  7974: |-
    ...You want my signature again?
    This is most irregular. How embarrassing for the Tenshodo to have to go over the same ground twice. Doesn't exactly inspire faith now, does it?${prompt}
  7975: '...Nevertheless, I have been given this opportunity to be out here in the fresh air and speak with people after being cooped up inside for such a long time. Let''s leave it up to this impartial die to decide whether this encounter was a fortunate one or not.${prompt}'
  7976: I see you are carrying dice as well. If you say you are here without guile, then roll the die. It will judge your innocence.${prompt}
  7977: |-
    However...
    If the die judges you have evil intent, this knife will carry out your sentence...${prompt}
  7978: "You can't escape. You are now in the hands of Fate. \nLife. Death. Everything rests on the roll of the die.${prompt}"
  7979: "If you beat my die, then victory is yours. \nNow, roll.${prompt}"
  7980: '${color-alt: 121}You roll the die and get a ${number: 2}!'
  7981: |-
    This is ominous.
    You appear to be quite the villain. Now it is my turn. Please hand me the die.${prompt}
  7982: '${color-alt: 121}Pauluart rolls the die and gets 789!'
  7983: |-
    Ahahaha!
    I win! Your die has judged you unworthy. Prepare to receive your sentence.${prompt}
  7984: |-
    Yell out?
    ${selection-lines}
    The smaller number wins!${prompt}
  7985: |-
    ...What?
    Huh? This die...${prompt}
  7986: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 1[2]}...
    ...Ah, this is...
    Sniggnix, you've been telling secrets again.${prompt}
  7987: |-
    You win this time.
    I suppose I'll sign the papers for you.
    It's a shame, for I had hoped to feel the warmth of fresh blood again...${prompt}
  7988: Please send my friends my regards. And to your friends also.
  7989: |-
    You rolled lower number, right?
    This die, also called “Sinner's Die.”
    When you roll that die, they tell the weight of your sins.${prompt}
  7990: |-
    Pauluart's sins, far greater than yours.
    He has no right to judge your guilt.${prompt}
  7991: Dépêche-toi, ${choice-player-gender}[pal/lady]. Je ne suis pas là pour toi.${prompt}
  7992: |-
    Ouais, je me souviens de toi.
    Tu as entendu la rumeur comme quoi le groupe d'Atarefaunet aurait caché leur trésor dans cette foutue Citadelle de Garlaige ?${prompt}
  7993: |-
    ...Ce n'est pas pour ça que tu es ici ?
    Tu as quelque chose à me demander ? Eh bien, tu ferais bien de t'en débarrasser rapidement. Je suis un homme occupé.${prompt}
  7994: Et si je te dis ? Ça ne sert à rien de fourrer ton foutu nez dans des affaires déjà terminées, mon ami.${prompt}
  7995: |-
    Très bien.
    Je suppose que c'est ton foutu problème. Si tu me ramènes des ${item-plural: 1[2]}, alors je t'aiderai.${prompt}
  7996: |-
    Voici l'accord de merde.
    Ramène-moi quatre ${item-plural: 1[2]} que les alchimistes sont censés fabriquer. Ensuite on parlera.${prompt}
  7997: |-
    Ne me fais pas répéter, bordel !
    Je veux quatre ${item-plural: 1[2]} que les alchimistes fabriquent. Ensuite on a un accord.${prompt}
  7998: |-
    J'ai pensé à me joindre à la chasse au trésor...
    Il est presque définitivement caché quelque part dans cette foutue Citadelle de Garlaige.${prompt}
  7999: |-
    Tu les as !
    Je n'aurais pas pu fabriquer ces foutus trucs moi-même.${prompt}
  8000: Maintenant je peux finir mon travail. Et manger un sacré bon repas.${prompt}
  8001: |-
    ...Maintenant, pour répondre à ta foutue question.
    La signature sur mes papiers était un « O. »${prompt}
  8002: Je ne sais pas ce que tu prévois, mais sois bien prudent. Ce Vauderame n'est pas un homme avec qui on joue à la légère.${prompt}
  8003: Si je n'avais pas eu cette foutue mission, je me serais joint à la chasse au trésor. On dirait que tout arrive pour une raison.${prompt}
  8004: |-
    Souviens-toi de ça.
    Le travail de voleur et l'aventure ne vont pas ensemble. Ne mange pas plus que tu ne peux mastiquer. C'est bien vrai !${prompt}
  8005: Quoi ? Une boîte à outils qui ne s'ouvre pas ? Oh, ouais... Il y a longtemps, j'ai pris une boîte étrange dans l'un des entrepôts de Brugaire.${prompt}
  8006: La boîte était vieille et sale, mais je ne pouvais pas attendre de l'ouvrir et de voir le trésor à l'intérieur. Mais elle ne s'ouvrait tout simplement pas !${prompt}
  8007: 'Attends, tu cherches cette boîte ? Hmm... Je vais te la vendre pour ${number: 0} gil.${prompt}'
  8008: |-
    Well?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fine, I'll take it.
    No, thanks.${prompt}
  8009: Oh, yeah? Well, I'm not telling you where it is, then!${prompt}
  8010: That's the spirit, my fine customer!${prompt}
  8011: I left the toolbox on top of a crate outside the Duty-Free shop in Port Jeuno. Till just now I had completely forgotten it!${prompt}
  8012: Look, the toolbox is on top of a crate outside of Port Jeuno's Duty-Free shop. Go ahead and take it.${prompt}
  8013: Hey, what are you tryin' to pull? Get lost!${prompt}
  8014: Sorry, I'm busy. Something awful has happened, and it'll take one helluva beastmaster to sort it out.${prompt}
  8015: Perfect timing! We were hoping to find a renowned beastmaster like you to take care of a little problem.${prompt}
  8016: You see, the beasts who inhabit Eldieme are acting strange lately. It's like they're under someone's control. They've attacked adventurers, and recently killed one!${prompt}
  8017: People suspect we beastmasters have something to do with it. You should know we'd never do anything like that. Won't you look into this for us?${prompt}
  8018: You see, the beasts that inhabit Eldieme are acting strange lately. It's like someone or something is controlling them. Could you look into it for us?${prompt}
  8019: |-
    Will you help us?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course I will.
    Not right now.${prompt}
  8020: I knew you would! Many skilled beastmasters have gone, but none have returned. Maybe they've fallen to whatever is controlling the beasts!${prompt}
  8021: 'Take ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to protect yourself. Ask Osker in the stables in Upper Jeuno to help you.${prompt}'
  8022: You're the only one we can turn to! Please come back as soon as you can.${prompt}
  8023: 'So you''ve got ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}. Good work! You will know when to use it. Now, to the Eldieme Necropolis!${prompt}'
  8024: So that was what was happening. I'm happy that the honor of beastmasters has been cleared. On behalf of everyone here, I thank you.${prompt}
  8025: Pets are precious to beastmasters. I almost lost one, so I know how it feels. ${prompt}
  8026: The other night I dreamed I was riding my old chocobo across the plains. Brutus told me he'd let me see it again, and I can't wait!${prompt}
  8027: The other day I was finally able to ride my old chocobo... It was like, well, a dream come true. I never remembered riding to be so exciting.${prompt}
  8028: |-
    Ahhhhhh-choo!
    Excuse me. I think I caught myself a cold riding that old girl all night. My son's been taking care of me since morning.${prompt}
  8029: |-
    I don't know how to thank you for all you've done for me. I think I'll take me some of that great medicine you got for my son and get back into bed. Be seeing you!
    <Cough-cough!>${prompt}
  8030: Look at you, a true bard! Me? I think I've finally recovered from the pain of rejection.${prompt}
  8031: I couldn't bring myself to throw away the bracelet she gave me, but maybe now is the time.${prompt}
  8032: It breaks my heart to cast it away! Please, maybe you could do it for me?${prompt}
  8033: I can't throw away the bracelet she gave me. Please, maybe you could do it for me?${prompt}
  8034: |-
    Could you throw it away for me?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oh, I suppose.
    No, do it yourself.${prompt}
  8035: Thank you! But this gift is too precious to toss into the garbage... I know! Could you cast it into the Waters of Oblivion at Ranguemont Pass?${prompt}
  8036: Good luck, and don't just dump it at some auction house, all right?${prompt}
  8037: Hmm... Maybe you're right. But I don't think I can bring myself to do it!${prompt}
  8038: It's too precious to throw into the garbage. No, it needs a more peaceful resting place, like the Water of Oblivion in Ranguemont Pass.${prompt}
  8039: You threw it in? Thank you! My heart feels at peace, knowing that my ordeal is behind me. Please, take this in thanks.${prompt}
  8040: Perhaps everything is as full of memories as that bracelet... Should someone find it a hundred years hence, what shall they feel?${prompt}
  8041: Yes, maybe such feelings do not diminish with the flow of time. Oh, what a moving thought!${prompt}
  8042: Perhaps my heartfelt pain will live on in my song. Such is the life of a bard!${prompt}
  8043: Say, I see you're quite a bard now. I'm looking for a bard, you see...${prompt}
  8044: I thought you'd be a perfect match for this task. What do you say?${prompt}
  8045: |-
    Interested?
    ${selection-lines}
    You bet.
    Spare me.${prompt}
  8046: Merci, ciel ! Écoute, c'est une tâche si pénible que personne ne veut la faire. J'ai tellement de chance que tu sois là !${prompt}
  8047: 'Eh bien, pour commencer, tu devras m’apporter ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. On ne peut pas faire grand-chose sans.${prompt}'
  8048: Oh, tu es occupé, hein ? Alors, à qui suis-je censé demander maintenant ? Des bardes comme toi, ça ne pousse pas sur les arbres, tu sais !${prompt}
  8049: Dis, qu'en est-il de cette tâche dont je t'ai parlé ?${prompt}
  8050: Bien, cela fera l'affaire. Maintenant, pour la tâche ! Je veux que tu visites la tombe d'un grand barde d'antan et que tu pries pour lui.${prompt}
  8051: Pourquoi, demandes-tu ? Je ne sais pas, c'est juste une tradition. On dit qu'il a eu une fin tragique. Demande à d'autres bardes si tu veux en savoir plus sur lui.${prompt}
  8052: Son sarcophage de pierre se trouve au fond de la Nécropole d'Eldieme. Il y en a plusieurs, et je ne me souviens plus lequel. Eh bien, tu le trouveras.${prompt}
  8053: 'Une petite enquête révélera lequel est le sien. Purifie-le avec ce ${item-singular: 0[2]} et joue le requiem. Tu ne connais pas l’air ? Ce n’est pas grave, vas-y !${prompt}'
  8054: Hein ? Le barde enterré dans Eldieme ? Oui, il a été exécuté à San d'Oria pour un crime grave !${prompt}
  8055: Alors, tu vas prier sur sa tombe, hein ? Fais attention ! On ne sait jamais quel mal rôde dans ces couloirs !${prompt}
  8056: 'Oh, as-tu pris le ${item-singular: 0[2]} et joué le requiem ? La tâche n’est pas terminée tant que tu n’as pas fait les deux !${prompt}'
  8057: Bon travail, ${name-player} ! Oui, désolé de ne pas t'avoir parlé des monstres. Sinon, personne ne s'y rendrait ! Tu comprends ?${prompt}
  8058: Hein ? Après cela, un homme est venu te donner une bague ? J'espère qu'il n'était pas un pilleur de tombes !${prompt}
  8059: Mais ne me donne pas cette bague ; je déteste les antiquités. Quoi qu'il en soit, voici ta récompense. Merci encore !${prompt}
  8060: Eh bien, c'est réglé. Maintenant, à qui devrais-je demander pour la prochaine tâche ? Les bardes peuvent être si égoïstes parfois !${prompt}
  8061: Alors, qu'as-tu fait de cette bague ? Peut-être qu'elle a de la valeur. Je demanderais à un collectionneur si j'étais toi. Bien sûr, il pourrait juste dire qu'elle ne vaut rien...${prompt}
  8062: Tu es devenu un héros pour les habitants de Jeuno. Rien que d'entendre ton nom leur donne du courage.${prompt}
  8063: En tant que représentant de ses citoyens, je te demande humblement de continuer tes efforts pour le bien du duché.${prompt}
  8064: 'Bonne chance, ${choice: 0}[citoyen/camarade]. Je vais te conférer le Signe de ta nation.${wait-animation: 0}${prompt}'
  8065: Je ne peux pas t'aider. Tu devrais trouver un garde de ton propre pays.${prompt}
  8066: |-
    Je ne peux pas accepter de cristaux de quelqu'un dont le rang est encore 1.
    Je te conseille soit de les garder jusqu'à ce que tu atteignes le rang 2, soit de les utiliser en artisanat.${prompt}

    Je suis désolé.
    Je suis trop occupé par d'autres affaires pour vous parler.${wait-animation: 0}${prompt}
  8071: Ah, vous nous avez apporté des provisions. Cela nous sera d'une grande aide. Je vous remercie.${prompt}
  8072: |-
    Hmm... Ces provisions que vous avez apportées sont trop vieilles pour être utilisables. Nous allons les éliminer rapidement.
    Je vous félicite pour vos efforts. Puissiez-vous réussir la prochaine fois.${prompt}
  8073: Vous avez gagné des points de conquête !${prompt}
  8074: |-
    Vous avez reçu le Sceau de votre nation.
    Vous participez désormais à la campagne de conquête de votre nation !${prompt}
  8075: |-
    Je suis ${name-npc}, un Chevalier du Temple.
    Je fais partie des gardes chargés de superviser la campagne de conquête de San d'Oria.${prompt}

    Pourriez-vous me lancer le Sceau ?
    Je veux utiliser mes points de conquête.
    ${choice: 0}[Je veux rejoindre la Force Expéditionnaire./Téléportez-moi dans la zone de la F.E.]
    Je veux quitter la F.E./changer ma F.E.
    Je veux faire une quête de provisions.
    J'ai quelques questions...
    Rien, désolé de vous déranger.${prompt}
  8079: |-
    Sur quel sujet souhaitez-vous des informations ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Rien.
    Conquêtes.
    Résultats des conquêtes.
    Donner des cristaux.
    Points de conquête.
    Effets du contrôle des régions.
    Régions contrôlées par d'autres nations.
    Régions sous contrôle des hommes-bêtes.${prompt}
  8080: Les trois nations s'efforcent chaque jour de mettre plus de régions sous leur contrôle. C'est ce que nous appelons les “conquêtes.” Vous pouvez y participer et servir votre pays en battant des ennemis tout en ayant le Sceau de votre nation sur vous.${prompt}
  8081: Chaque région comprend plusieurs zones, et la nation qui débarrasse ces zones du plus grand nombre de monstres prend le contrôle de la région.${prompt}
  8082: Les nations reçoivent des biens et des ressources des régions sous leur contrôle.${prompt}
  8083: Donc, plus nous contrôlons de régions, plus notre nation devient prospère.${prompt}
  8084: |-
    Des gardes-frontières sont également placés dans des avant-postes dans les régions sous notre contrôle.
    Ils sont là pour lancer le Sceau sur des aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
  8085: Une fois que vous avez le Sceau de votre nation, vous pourrez acquérir des cristaux en battant des ennemis.${prompt}
  8086: Non seulement cela, mais vous recevrez également des points de conquête. Vous obtenez plus de points de conquête si vous battez des ennemis dans des régions qui ne sont pas sous le contrôle de votre nation. Ces points peuvent être utilisés pour acheter des objets auprès de gardes comme moi.${prompt}
  8087: |-
    Vous voyez donc... les conquêtes bénéficient aussi bien aux nations qu'aux aventuriers.
    Nous attendons de vous que vous fassiez de votre mieux pour servir votre pays.${prompt}
  8088: |-
    Vous pouvez voir l'état actuel des conquêtes en sélectionnant “Info Régions” dans le menu principal.
    Les résultats des conquêtes dans toutes les régions sont régulièrement recalculés, donc vous pouvez les vérifier de temps en temps.${prompt}
  8089: |-
    Les boutiques de notre ville vendront différents objets en fonction de notre classement de conquête.
    La Troupe Valeriano visitera également la nation qui termine en première place et apportera un peu de joie à ses citoyens.${prompt}
  8090: |-
    Vous pouvez faire don de cristaux à votre nation une fois que vous atteignez le rang 2.
    Il suffit de les échanger avec des gardes comme moi, et nous nous assurerons qu'ils sont envoyés au bon endroit.${prompt}
  8091: |-
    Nous aimerions que vous donniez des cristaux à votre nation dorénavant.
    Il suffit de les échanger avec des gardes comme moi, et nous nous assurerons qu'ils sont envoyés au bon endroit.${prompt}
  8092: |-
    Vous pouvez obtenir des cristaux en battant des ennemis tout en ayant le Sceau de votre nation.
    Avoir le Sceau sur vous est également le seul moyen de participer aux conquêtes.${prompt}
  8093: Des points de rang vous seront attribués pour chaque cristal que vous donnez, et de nouvelles missions peuvent vous être proposées à mesure que votre rang augmente.${prompt}
  8094: |-
    Vous recevez également des points de rang pour chaque mission accomplie.
    Accomplissez des missions et participez aux conquêtes pour augmenter votre rang et servir votre pays.${prompt}
  8095: |-
    Vous recevez des points de conquête lorsque vous battez des monstres en participant aux conquêtes.
    Sélectionnez "Info Régions" dans le menu pour consulter votre nombre actuel de points de conquête.${prompt}
  8096: Vous pouvez acheter des objets auprès de gardes comme moi avec vos points de conquête, mais attention, le nombre de points dépensés sera soustrait de votre total actuel.${prompt}
  8097: Lorsque les résultats de la conquête sont annoncés, on vous indiquera quel pays contrôle la région où vous vous trouvez à ce moment-là. Parfois, les régions peuvent devenir neutres, ou même tomber sous le contrôle des hommes-bêtes.${prompt}
  8098: Si nous prenons le contrôle d'une région, des gardes-frontières seront placés aux avant-postes pour aider des aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
  8099: Des marchands y seront également placés, et les biens de cette région se retrouveront dans les magasins locaux ici.${prompt}
  8100: Le contrôle des régions est le principe de base des conquêtes. Nous avons besoin que chacun d'entre vous donne le meilleur de lui-même pour porter notre nation au sommet du classement.${prompt}
  8101: Bien sûr, parfois nous perdons des régions au profit d'autres nations... nous devons donc essayer de les reprendre avant l'annonce des prochains résultats de la conquête.${prompt}
  8102: En guise d'incitation, nous vous attribuerons plus de points de conquête pour vaincre des monstres dans ces régions.${prompt}
  8103: Cependant, si nous sommes alliés avec une autre nation, vous recevrez seulement le taux régulier pour vaincre des monstres dans les régions de nos alliés. En revanche, nous vous attribuerons plus de points pour combattre dans les régions de la nation en tête du classement.${prompt}
  8104: |-
    Notre principale préoccupation est que les hommes-bêtes prennent le contrôle de nos régions.
    Si trop d'entre nous sont vaincus dans une région, les hommes-bêtes en prendront le contrôle.${prompt}
  8105: Si cela se produit, non seulement c'est un coup dur pour notre fierté, mais vous ne pourrez pas acquérir de cristaux dans cette région.${prompt}
  8106: Les hommes-bêtes représentent une menace pour toutes les nations. S'ils gagnent en puissance, nous devons tous nous unir pour chasser ces viles créatures de cette région.${prompt}
  8107: Nous avons besoin que vous apportiez des provisions aux gardes des avant-postes qui se trouvent dans les régions sous notre contrôle.${prompt}
  8108: Il y a un avant-poste dans chaque région. Sélectionnez “Info Régions” dans le menu et cherchez les zones avec un petit drapeau sur la carte. C'est là qu'ils se trouvent.${prompt}

  8409: Aldo!${prompt}
  8410: I think I might know where Verena is.${prompt}

  8447: |-
    I'm so sorry, Fickblix...
    I've been caught up in my own troubles recently, and haven't come to check on these seeds.${prompt}
  8448: It sprouted! I knew that if everybody pitched in, it would grow.${prompt}
  8449: Fickblix... But...how?${prompt}
  8450: It's still just a sprout, but I know it'll bloom someday. I wish I could water it and feed it, too...${prompt}
  8451: '...${prompt}'

  8454: Well, I've got to go now, but I'm not sad anymore. What is that phrase you taught me, Verena?${prompt}
  8455: Yeah, “thank you.” That's the first phrase you taught me when I came here.${prompt}
  8456: We beastmen don't have a word for “thank you,” but I like that phrase a lot. I wanted to teach it to all my beastmen friends...${prompt}

  8463: Hold up there, ${name-player}. Where's Aldo? You didn't just leave him on that cursed island to die, did you?${prompt}
  8464: If anything has happened to our boss, don't even think you'll be leaving here alive!${prompt}

    Verena...
    Lion's...gone.${prompt}

  8481: Lion... Lion traded her life to stop Eald'narche's plan...${prompt}
  8482: No!${prompt}
  8483: She can't be... She just can't be gone! What did she do to deserve this!?${prompt}
  8484: |-
    Verena....
    Lion fought bravely that day. Her sacrifice saved millions of lives.${prompt}
  8485: So what!? Nothing we say can bring her back! She's...${prompt}
  8486: Why does everyone have to suffer!? What did Lion--what did Fickblix do to deserve their pain? I don't want to forget what they went through...${prompt}

  8488: '...?${prompt}'

  8490: It is you, isn't it...${prompt}
  8491: Aldo, Lion is still alive. I can feel it. She's weaker than before, but she's still with us.${prompt}
  8492: You may be right, Verena. And if there's any shred of hope, the least we can do is continue to believe.${prompt}
  8493: So, ${name-player}.${prompt}

    Well, I think it's time I took that vacation I've been promising myself. You should go someplace quiet and get some rest as well.

    What to do now? Maybe I'll get myself a boat and sail around Vana'diel...

  8598: Now listen up, I heard that the bushin had a disciple--some funky-spunky old geezer. He'd probably know where you could find mister master.${prompt}
  8599: I think he lived in Vas...Vost...Boost...Bust...Butt...${prompt}
  8600: |-
    Bast...ok! Bastok! Yeah, that's where he is.
    What? You thought I was going to tell you where the bushin was? Hah, you simpleton! That would be simply too simple!${prompt}
  8601: 'Wow! ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}!${prompt}'
  8602: When I was young, I never could figure out what was so especially special about these thing-i-ma-doodies, but now...${prompt}
  8603: Hm? Hegendard told you that the bushin might show you the black belt if you brought him one of these?${prompt}
  8604: |-
    What? Degenhard? Are you saying I got his name wrong? No I didn't! He's the one that got his name wrong.
    I don't know any Degenhards, anyway. Someone who doesn't know his own name can't be that great of a fidgety-fighter.${prompt}
  8605: Oh yeah, I met with the bushin a couple of days ago. He looked as tip-top tough as always, but the prehistoric guy is getting on in years. He says he's been having terrible trouble with his eyesightaru.${prompt}
  8606: So sad...${prompt}
  8607: Anyway, he mentioned that he had another disciple--some spickity-spunkity old geezer that likes to pester young adventurers by sending them on quests to go fetch him stuff.${prompt}
  8608: If anybody would know what would impress the bushin, it would be him. Why don't you go and search him outaru?${prompt}
  8609: 'Who knows, the bushin might be so impressed that he''d give you the ${item-singular: 0[2]}! (But I wouldn''t count on it...)${prompt}'
  8610: |-
    Wow! Wow!
    This is a pretty pretty ${item-singular: 5[2]}! I can see why the bushin would want one of these.${prompt}
  8611: You say you got the idea from Maat?${prompt}
  8612: |-
    Maat...
    Meat...
    Mart...
    Never heard of him. Oh well.${prompt}
  8613: If I've never heard of him, then he can't be that super-duper. I bet he's one of those guys that spends their days training by themselves up in the corner of some lonely park.${prompt}
  8614: |-
    Anyway, anyway.
    You've done good so far. Bring me ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]} and I'll take you to see the bushin. How's that sound?
    What? You don't believe me? The bushin and I are like blood brothers! I can take you to him anytime!${prompt}
  8615: 'I mean, you''ve already brought him ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}. One more petty present and he''s sure to hand over his ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  8616: Well, what do you know! I knew you were an utterly outrageous adventurer the moment I laid my peepers on you.${prompt}
  8617: I'm sorry that I made you run all around. But it's not like you had anything better to do, rightaru?${prompt}
  8618: |-
    Anyway, here's the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.
    Atori-Tutori is not a man to break his promises.
    Well, ta-taru!${prompt}
  8619: |-
    What?
    What about my promise to take you to see the bushin?${prompt}
  8620: Hmph, you may be tough, but you aren't very brightaru...${prompt}
  8621: You've already met him!${prompt}
  8622: And I'm not talking about that old geezer!${prompt}
  8623: Or that other geezer either!${prompt}
  8624: |-
    Whatever.
    Maybe you should work on buffing up that miniscule muscle between your ears.
    Bye-bye!${prompt}
  8625: |-
    Hey Galka, out of my way!
    You're ruining my exitaru!${prompt}
  8626: Attends là !${prompt}
  8627: Vous devez être extrêmement confiant ou extrêmement stupide pour revenir comme ça à Jeuno, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8628: |-
    Nous venons de recevoir l'autorisation finale de votre nation d'origine.
    Vous êtes en état d'arrestation. L'accusation est trahison.${prompt}
  8629: Comment un homme est-il censé s'asseoir et savourer un bon verre de bière d'Opo-opo avec tout ce raffut ? Maintenant, quelqu'un va-t-il me dire ce qui se passe ici ?${prompt}
  8630: Aldo, je m'excuse pour cette intrusion soudaine. Nous ne sommes pas ici pour causer des ennuis à votre entreprise. Nous sommes seulement ici pour escorter ce criminel de retour au palais.${prompt}
  8631: Criminel ?${prompt}
  8632: Ah ! C'est le ${choice-player-gender}[type/dame] mort !${prompt}
  8633: Hé ! C'est moi ! Tu ne te souviens pas...
  8634: Wow !
  8635: |-
    Wolfgang, Wolfgang, Wolfgang...
    Regarde autour de toi. Est-ce que ça ressemble à un tribunal ? C'est chez moi, et tous ceux chez moi sont mes invités. Tu ne vas pas appeler mes invités des criminels, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8636: Aldo, cet aventurier n'est pas juste un vulgaire voleur. ${choice-player-gender}[Il/Elle] est soupçonné d'avoir commis une trahison contre le Duché. Si vous envisagez de protéger cette menace pour la société, la Garde Ducalesque sera forcée d'agir.${prompt}
  8637: Action ? Si vous voulez voir de l'action, essayez simplement de toucher un de mes invités.${prompt}
  8638: |-
    Hmph... Tu ne changes jamais, Aldo.
    Aventurier ! Si vous savez ce qui est bon pour vous, vous vous rendrez au Grand Palais et vous vous rendrez une fois que vous aurez fini ici.${prompt}
  8639: Et n'essayez même pas de fuir. Le mandat d'arrêt pour vous a déjà été envoyé à travers Vana'diel. Il n'y a nulle part où se cacher, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  8640: Wow, donc vous êtes un criminel. Laissez-moi deviner, ils vous ont envoyé à Tavnazia comme partie de votre punition, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8641: Alors, qu'avez-vous fait ? Vol ? Meurtre ? Les deux...?${prompt}
  8642: Je vois que vous vous connaissez.${prompt}
  8643: Ouais. Cet aventurier mal fagoté est apparu mort sur ma plage privée. J'ai aidé à le ramener à la vie.${prompt}
  8644: |-
    Hé, attends une minute.
    Aldo, pourquoi ne pas demander à ce ${choice-player-gender}[type/dame] ? ${choice-player-gender}[Il/Elle] vous dira que je ne mens pas.${prompt}
  8645: |-
    D'accord.
    ${name-player}, est-il vrai qu'un petit groupe de survivants a vécu sur la pointe sud de Tavnazia depuis les vingt dernières années ?${prompt}
  8646: |-
    　
    　
    　
    　${prompt}
  8647: Tu vois ! Maintenant, tu me crois ?${prompt}
  8648: Ce crétin borné n'a pas voulu écouter un seul mot de ce que j'avais à dire !${prompt}
  8649: Hah ! Une étrange fille arrive en défonçant ma porte, en criant le nom de mon père, que son âme repose en paix avec Altana - qu'étais-je censé faire ?${prompt}
  8650: |-
    Qu'étais-tu censé faire ? Qu'étais-je censée faire ?
    La seule personne en qui je pouvais avoir confiance - bon sang, la seule personne que je connaissais sur le continent - était Grezzo.${prompt}
  8651: Il m'a dit que chaque fois que j'étais dans le pétrin, lui et le Tenshodo m'aideraient.${prompt}
  8652: Mais maintenant, il est parti et...${prompt}
  8653: Bon, tu nous trouveras encore un bateau pour qu'on puisse rentrer chez nous, hein ?${prompt}
  8654: Hmmm... Ce ne sera pas aussi facile que ça en a l'air. J'ai encore des cartes nautiques qui montrent le chemin jusqu'à l'antre du Sealion, mais elles sont obsolètes. Les courants dans cette région ont beaucoup changé au cours des vingt dernières années...${prompt}
  8655: Il faudrait un sacré navigateur pour arriver à Tavnazia en un seul morceau. Mais encore une fois, je n'emploie que les meilleurs des meilleurs.${prompt}
  8656: |-
    Vous pourriez avoir de la chance.
    Il y a juste quelques jours, un autre client est venu me voir pour que je l'emmène à Tavnazia. J'étais sur le point de lui dire non également... jusqu'à ce que je voie le sac de gil qu'il offrait.${prompt}
  8657: Un autre client ? Pourquoi quelqu'un d'autre voudrait-il aller à Tavnazia ?${prompt}
  8658: |-
    Je ne sais pas. Je ne suis pas dans le métier de poser des questions, jeune dame. Tant que je suis payé, je me fiche de ce qu'il fait là-bas.
    Et je m'en fiche si vous vous joignez à lui, mais ce n'est pas à moi de décider. Vous devrez obtenir la permission du client.${prompt}
  8659: Oh, bon. Bien que j'espérais une croisière privée, je suppose que je ne peux pas me plaindre.${prompt}
  8660: Quel geste attentionné...${prompt}
  8661: Et vous, ${name-player}. Pourquoi ne pas retourner à Tavnazia aussi ? Vous pourriez vous cacher là-bas un moment jusqu'à ce que Wolfgang se calme.${prompt}
  8662: |-
    Pas question !
    ${name-player} ! Si tu es un vrai ${choice-player-gender}[homme/femme], tu iras au Palais du Grand Duc et tu affronteras tes crimes !${prompt}
  8663: |-
    Dure avec tout le monde sauf toi-même, je vois...
    Très bien. Il faudra un peu de temps pour préparer le navire. Je vous enverrai un messager quand tout sera prêt. D'ici là, pourquoi ne pas visiter la ville ?${prompt}
  8664: Compris. Merci, Aldo.${prompt}
  8665: D'accord ! Maintenant, c'est le moment de s'amuser !${prompt}
  8666: À plus tard, ${name-player} ! Peut-être qu'on pourra se revoir un jour... si tu es encore en vie !${prompt}
  8667: Eh bien, il semble que vous devriez probablement vous rendre. Cela pourrait être votre seule chance de prouver votre innocence.${prompt}
  8668: Il semble que vous devriez probablement vous rendre, ${name-player}. Cela pourrait être votre seule chance de prouver votre innocence.${prompt}
  8669: ${name-player}, vous n'étiez pas en train de penser à vous enfuir maintenant, n'est-ce pas ? Si vous savez ce qui est bon pour vous, vous irez au Palais du Grand Duc et affronterez vos crimes.${prompt}
  8670: Ah, ${name-player}. Exactement le ${choice-player-gender}[homme/femme] que je voulais voir.${prompt}
  8671: Une jeune dame se prétendant connaissance de Prishe est ici...${prompt}
  8672: ${name-player} ! C'est si agréable de vous revoir. N'avez-vous pas vu Prishe récemment ?${prompt}
  8673: Hm ? Vous la cherchez aussi ?${prompt}
  8674: |-
    Je vois...
    Vous voulez en savoir plus sur la gemme de magisite qu'un colporteur de Tavnazia a vendue à Bastok il y a plus de trente ans...${prompt}
  8675: Je me souviens avoir entendu des histoires sur l'« Étoile de Tavnazia » ; malheureusement, je ne l'ai jamais vue de mes propres yeux. Je ne sais pas ce que c'est, ni si la magisite en était un morceau.${prompt}
  8676: |-
    Magisite...
    L'Étoile de Tavnazia...${prompt}
  8677: |-
    ?
    Monsieur Aldo ? Vous ne sauriez rien sur cette gemme, par hasard ?${prompt}
  8678: J'ai entendu parler d'une gemme mystérieuse gardée dans la Cathédrale de Tavnazia. Si cette relique est aussi de la magisite, je me demande de quelle manière elle est reliée à l'autre magisite trouvée à travers Vana'diel...${prompt}
  8679: Au plus profond des forteresses des Orcs, Quadav et Yagudos, il y a des portes que les bêtes gardent de leur vie. Au-delà de ces portes se trouvent des cristaux géants émettant une lumière étrange et sinistre.${prompt}
  8680: Si les bêtes ont été attirées par ces cristaux et ont choisi ces endroits pour construire leurs villes, alors la magisite dans les Terres du Nord est très probablement... Hmmm...${prompt}
  8681: Peut-être que quelqu'un à Tavnazia sait quelque chose. Cependant, nous ne pouvons pas partir sans Prishe. Oh, où a-t-elle bien pu aller ?${prompt}
  8682: |-
    Chef !
    Cette fille ! Elle a été emmenée chez le Docteur Monberaux !${prompt}
  8683: |-
    Quoi !?
    Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé !?${prompt}
  8684: Il semble qu'elle ait été attaquée pendant qu'elle visitait le Temple de la Déesse !${prompt}
  8685: Attaquée !?${prompt}
  8686: Prishe !
  8687: |-
    On dit qu'une fille Elvaan a été attaquée dans le Temple de la Déesse - juste devant la statue d'Altana !
    À quoi en est venue cette ville !?${prompt}
  8688: |-
    Hein ? Tu penses que c'est un membre du Tenshodo qui a fait le coup !?
    ${name-player}, tu ferais mieux de surveiller ta langue à moins que tu ne veuilles la voir sur une assiette !${prompt}
  8689: Cette fille aux cheveux bleus a été emmenée chez Monberaux après l'attaque. Je suis presque sûr qu'elle ira bien, cependant. Le Docteur M. est le meilleur médecin de la ville.${prompt}
  8690: Vous n'avez pas besoin de vous inquiéter, ${name-player}. Notre excellent médecin de la ville s'occupe de Prishe en ce moment même.${prompt}
  8691: Et en ce qui concerne les vauriens qui ont fait une chose pareille, je vous garantis que mes hommes et femmes les trouveront.${prompt}
  8692: Si vous cherchez Prishe, elle et ce riche garçon, Tenzen, sont déjà partis pour l'archipel de Tavnazia. Vous les suivez, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8693: Monsieur, les aéronefs sont prêts pour le départ.${prompt}
  8694: Je voyagerai sur un navire séparé. Si « lui » apparaît avant mon arrivée, empêchez-le de s'échapper, mais ne l'attaquez pas.${prompt}
  8695: Oui, monsieur !${prompt}
  8696: Tout se déroule comme prévu. Maintenant, je vais enfin récupérer ce qui m'appartient.${prompt}
  8697: |-
    Salut, mon pote.
    Je viens de rencontrer le gamin Elvaan le plus étrange.${prompt}
  8698: Elle n'avait pas un seul gil sur elle, mais elle a passé des heures dans le magasin de bijoux à soupirer sur le même bijou.${prompt}
  8699: Finalement, les beautés derrière le comptoir en ont eu assez de ses manigances et l'ont mise dehors.${prompt}
  8700: J'avais regardé toute la scène et j'ai eu la malchance de croiser le regard de la fille quand elle a quitté le magasin.${prompt}
  8701: Elle me suit depuis.${prompt}
  8702: Je ne sais pas si c'était l'intuition féminine ou quoi, mais d'une manière ou d'une autre, elle a compris que j'avais un faible pour les trois femmes du magasin de bijoux.${prompt}
  8703: |-
    ...
    Alors, laquelle est ma préférée des trois ?${prompt}
  8704: Au début, je pensais que la beauté classique à gauche était mon type.${prompt}
  8705: Mais ensuite, j'ai réfléchi que les femmes plus âgées étaient le meilleur choix, comme la dame à droite.${prompt}
  8706: |-
    Et puis, récemment, celle du milieu, pure et innocente, m'a vraiment dit bonjour.
    Maintenant, je suis captivé par son charme.${prompt}
  8707: Pour être tout à fait honnête avec vous, n'importe laquelle de ces trois femmes pourrait me rendre heureux.${prompt}
  8708: Mon plan est de confesser mes sentiments à celle qui m'aime le plus - celle qui est le moins susceptible de me rejeter.${prompt}
  8709: |-
    Quand j'ai expliqué tout cela à la fille Elvaan, elle a presque éclaté de rire.
    Cette petite peste !${prompt}
  8710: 'Elle m''a dit que si je parlais à chacune des dames à tour de rôle tout en tenant ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, je saurais laquelle d''entre elles avait des sentiments pour moi.${prompt}'
  8711: 'Mais je n''ai même jamais entendu parler de ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, encore moins vu un.${prompt}'
  8712: Même un aventurier comme vous ne saurait pas où trouver une gemme comme celle-là, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8713: |-
    Une idée sur les ${item-plural: 1[2]} ?
    ${selection-lines}
    J'ai une assez bonne idée.
    Jamais entendu parler d'eux.${prompt}
  8714: |-
    Pas d'idée, hein ?
    Je pense que ce gamin me mène en bateau pour rigoler.${prompt}
  8715: |-
    Tu es sérieux ?
    Tu es sûr que tu ne te moques pas de mes sentiments, comme ce gamin Elvaan ?${prompt}
  8716: |-
    Grrr !
    Rien que de penser au sourire narquois de cette peste...${prompt}
  8717: 'Pourrais-je vraiment découvrir laquelle de ces beautés a des sentiments pour moi si j''avais ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} ?${prompt}'
  8718: "Non, les choses ne sont jamais aussi simples. \nCe gamin Elvaan se moque juste de moi.${prompt}"
  8719: 'Est-ce vraiment... ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} !?${prompt}'
  8720: |-
    Je ne peux pas croire que ce gamin disait la vérité.
    Eh bien, je serai damné.${prompt}
  8721: |-
    Il n'y a pas de temps à perdre.
    Je dois y aller et trouver la fille de mes rêves !${prompt}
  8722: |-
    Tu es prêt ?
    J'y vais !${prompt}
  8723: Je cherche à acheter un collier...${prompt}
  8724: |-
    Bien sûr, monsieur !
    Est-ce un cadeau pour quelqu'un de spécial ?${prompt}
  8725: Euh, ouais... ça pourrait être...${prompt}
  8726: Nous avons une grande sélection parmi laquelle choisir ! Un instant, monsieur !${prompt}
  8727: Mon Dieu, mes mains ne cessent de transpirer.${prompt}
  8728: 'Alors, comment ce ${item-singular: 1[2]} est-il censé fonctionner ?${prompt}'
  8729: |-
    Wow !
    Le ${item-singular: 1[2]} a changé de couleur !
    Est-ce ce qu'elle voulait dire !?${prompt}
  8730: 'Ce ${item-singular: 1[2]} est une gemme fantastique !${prompt}'
  8731: Tu es parti avant que ça ne devienne intéressant, mais tu aurais dû voir les étincelles de romance voler entre moi et Adelflete.${prompt}
  8732: Mon choix est fait !${prompt}
  8733: |-
    Ce n'est pas juste de savoir qu'elle m'aime.
    Maintenant, je réalise à quel point je l'aime !${prompt}
  8734: Vous dites avoir tout vu auparavant ?${prompt}
  8735: |-
    Hahaha !
    On dirait que quelqu'un a un petit cas de jalousie.${prompt}
  8736: Eh bien, voici un petit cadeau de l'homme le plus heureux du monde pour vous remonter le moral.${prompt}
  8737: |-
    Hahaha !
    Ne regardez pas si morose. Le monde est plein de possibilités, même pour vous !${prompt}
  8738: |-
    Hahaha !
    Je suis désolé, mais un seul regard sur votre visage raconte toute l'histoire.
    Me voir avec ma nouvelle fille vous rappelle à quel point vous avez de la malchance, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8739: |-
    Ne vous inquiétez pas, mon pote ! Le monde est plein de possibilités !
    Hahaha !${prompt}
  8740: Le client que Adelflete vient de servir - n'est-ce pas l'homme qui traîne toujours devant le magasin ?${prompt}
  8741: |-
    Avez-vous vu par hasard la gemme qu'il tenait ?
    C'est une pierre rare qui change de couleur en fonction de la température.${prompt}
  8742: |-
    Ah oui, j'en ai déjà vu une.
    Quand la personne qui la tient devient chaude et agitée, la teinte de la gemme change.${prompt}
  8743: J'ai entendu dire qu'elle est utilisée dans d'autres pays pour mesurer l'intensité des sentiments d'une personne.${prompt}
  8744: Ce qui signifierait qu'il est plutôt épris de notre Adelflete, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8745: |-
    Je me demandais après qui il en avait depuis un moment maintenant.
    Maintenant, nous savons.${prompt}
  8746: |-
    J'ai hâte de voir ce qui va se passer.
    C'est comme avoir une de ces pièces romantiques juste à l'intérieur du magasin !${prompt}
  8747: |-
    Quoi, vous voulez explorer les tours de Pso'Xja ?
    Ça ne devrait pas poser de problème. Nous avons récemment ouvert ces ruines à tous les explorateurs.${prompt}
  8748: Cependant, le Tenshodo mène actuellement une investigation sur les zones plus profondes de la tour centrale, et nous ne pouvons pas avoir des aventuriers gênants courir partout et nous déranger.${prompt}
  8749: Toutefois... si vous nous rendiez service, nous n'aurions aucun problème à vous en rendre un en retour.${prompt}
  8750: Il se trouve que le Tenshodo recherche un certain joyau très populaire dans les pays du Proche-Orient.${prompt}
  8751: Quel genre de gemme est-ce ? Hmmm... Eh bien, elles sont fines, en forme hexagonale, et disponibles dans des couleurs rares comme le carmin et le cyan. J'ai entendu dire que les riches aiment les utiliser pour décorer leurs turbans.${prompt}
  8752: On dit même que parfois une lumière étrange jaillit de leur centre, bien que je ne l'aie jamais vu se produire.${prompt}
  8753: Heureusement pour vous, nous en trouvons beaucoup dans les autres tours de Pso'Xja.${prompt}
  8754: Malheureusement, un étrange appareil dans cet endroit semble affaiblir même les plus forts de nos membres. C'est là que vous intervenez.${prompt}
  8755: Maintenant, si vous trouviez l'un de ceux-là et le rameniez, je suis presque sûr que je pourrais convaincre le patron de vous permettre d'accéder à la tour centrale.${prompt}
  8756: Si vous voulez accéder aux parties les plus profondes de Pso'Xja, apportez-moi un joyau des ruines et je verrai ce que je peux faire.${prompt}
  8757: |-
    Hmmm...
    Ça ressemble beaucoup à ce que nous cherchons, mais la couleur n'est pas la bonne. Nous voulons quelque chose d'un peu plus « exotique » que les gemmes de couleur ordinaire.${prompt}
  8758: |-
    Eh bien, on dirait que vous savez des choses.
    C'est exactement ce que nous cherchions.${prompt}
  8759: Vous savez, vous n'êtes pas un mauvais chasseur de trésors. Avez-vous déjà pensé à rejoindre le Tenshodo ?${prompt}
  8760: |-
    Ah, mais vous vous ennuieriez probablement très vite.
    Quoi qu'il en soit, prenez ce laissez-passer. Il vous donnera accès aux zones les plus « sensibles » des ruines.${prompt}
  8761: Mais je vous avertis une dernière fois - les ruines de la tour centrale sont encore en cours d'investigation.${prompt}
  8762: Ne vous attendez pas à des équipes de recherche si vous vous perdez.${prompt}
  8763: |-
    Bienvenue au Pilier de Neptune !
    Hm ? Oh, je me souviens de vous. Vous êtes celui qui nous a apporté cette gemme de Pso'Xja.
    Après que vous l'ayez apportée, nous avons appris que... Attendez, comment puis-je savoir que je peux vous faire confiance ?${prompt}
  8764: |-
    Pouvez-vous garder un secret ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Mes lèvres sont scellées.
    Je ne peux rien garantir.${prompt}
  8765: |-
    Alors le Tenshodo ne peut pas vous faire confiance avec cette info.
    À plus tard, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame].${prompt}
  8766: |-
    Bienvenue à Neptune's...
    Ah, regardez qui revient. Avez-vous trouvé de la colle pour vos lèvres lâches ?${prompt}
  8767: |-
    Si je découvre que vous en avez parlé à quelqu'un, je... Eh bien, vous savez ce que nous vous ferons.
    Bref, à propos de ces gemmes de Pso'Xja...${prompt}
  8768: Eh bien, il semble que ces joyaux ne soient pas juste des pierres tombées d'un trou dans une montagne.${prompt}
  8769: 'Grâce à des aventuriers comme vous, nous avons appris qu''il existe trois types : gris, cyan, et carmin - et ils contiennent tous une sorte d''énergie étrange qui n''est trouvée nulle part ailleurs sur Vana''diel.${prompt}'
  8770: De plus, nous avons récemment reçu des rapports de nos collègues à Bastok que le principal ingénieur de la République, Cid, a été en train de collecter ces gemmes.${prompt}
  8771: Maintenant, si nous pouvons découvrir quel pouvoir ces fragments détiennent vraiment, le Tenshodo pourrait faire fortune !${prompt}
  8772: Oh, et bien sûr, vous aurez votre part. Vous ne pensez pas que nous vous escroquerions, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  8773: L'IRNC m'a dépêché pour aider à soutenir tous ceux qui souhaitent participer au Conflit.${prompt}
  8774: 'Avant de pouvoir participer à cet événement de Conflit, vous devez d''abord posséder ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}. Vous pouvez en obtenir un auprès du Commandant de Conflit de votre nation, ${choice: 1}[Excenmille, stationné à San d''Oria Nord./Invincible Shield, stationné aux Métallurgies à Bastok./Mhabi Molkot, stationnée dans la Tour des Cieux à Windurst.]${prompt}'
  8775: Seuls les aventuriers ayant atteint le rang 3 ou supérieur peuvent participer aux matchs officiels de Ballista. Veuillez revenir lorsque vous aurez prouvé votre loyauté envers votre nation d'origine.${prompt}
  8776: Cependant, si vous souhaitez toujours participer au Ballista, la participation aux matchs organisés dans Diorama Abdhaljs-Ghelsba est ouverte à tous les citoyens de Vana'diel.${prompt}

  8821: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  8822: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  8823: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  8824: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  8825: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  8826: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  8827: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  8828: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  8829: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  8830: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  8831: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  8832: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  8833: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  8834: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  8835: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  8836: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  8837: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  8838: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  8839: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  8840: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  8841: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  8842: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  8843: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  8844: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  8845: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  8846: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  8847: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  8848: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}
  8849: 'You find the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} hidden within the streetlamp and place it in the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  8850: You should be careful in a big city like Jeuno; there are always people ready to take advantage of your naiveté.${prompt}
  8851: Even a city dweller like me was duped a while back by a young Elvaan girl.${prompt}
  8852: She tricked me into giving her my fishing rod...${prompt}
  8853: |-

    Lend me your fishing rod!${prompt}
  8854: |-
    Lend you my rod?

    You can get attacked by all sorts of horrible creatures.${prompt}

  8869: 'A little while later she came back, insisting she had used my rod to catch ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'

  8875: Haven't you been listening to a thing I said about being naive?${prompt}
  8876: If you really believe her story, then you should prove it.${prompt}

  8935: That's why the Moblins never teamed up with the Shadow Lord in that big fracas twenty years ago.${prompt}
  8936: When the Moblin messengers delivered their refusal to join the Shadow Lord's army, they were torn ta pieces.${prompt}

  8964: Prenez la marmite quand Sniggnix aura fini, et rattrapez-les.
  8965: Le plan, c'est de dire aux Moblins que tu es un Gobelin déguisé en humain.
  8966: Les Moblins n'ont aucune idée de ce qui se passe ici, alors ils te croiront quand tu leur diras que les Gobelins ont un sort pour changer d'apparence.
  8967: La marmite est pleine maintenant.
  8968: |-
    Cette marmite est remplie de trucs qui sentent le Gobelin.

    I assume you wispy-wish to read about the Glass of Blessed Radiance?${prompt}
  9133: |-
    This tome describes the events leading up to when the Glass of Blessed Radiance lost its power.
    The author is quite the mirror enthusiastaru...${prompt}
  9134: |-
    Yes.
    The mirror's guardians stole the power of the Glass of Blessed Radiance as it rested in the Empire of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  9135: |-
    Hm hm hm...
    Do you not see? They were called the guardians of the mirror, but in truth were something quite different.${prompt}
  9136: |-
    They were the last line of defense against the Empire.
    That is why their existence was shrouded in secrecy...${prompt}
  9137: You think my theory unfounded?${prompt}
  9138: |-
    It matters not. One day I will uncover all the facts, and then I shall have the last laugh!
    Bwahahahahahaha!${prompt}
  9139: “The Mirror of Blighted Gloom is a divine artifact, designed to channel an otherworldly might...”${prompt}
  9140: |-
    Hmm...
    I suppose this means to describe the magnitude of the mirror's power.
    A childish phrase, but it does give some hint of the power's source...${prompt}
  9141: |-
    “An otherworldly might.”
    Meaning an energy that originates in another dimension...${prompt}
  9142: |-
    Hehehe.
    The person...or being...who crafted this mirror must have shared a brilliance akin to my own.${prompt}
  9143: And if our goals were as similar, then the origin of this power...${prompt}
  9144: |-
    Hehe...
    This is promising indeed.
    Hahaha...bwahahahahaha!${prompt}
  9145: |-
    Hehehehe...

  9146: The Mirror of Blighted Gloom is a conduit to the Dark Divinity!${prompt}

    All my theories have been proven.
    This “otherworldly might” must be mine.${prompt}
  9148: |-
    It is time to put my research to the test!
    Bwahahahahaha!${prompt}
  9149: |-
    This tome--“The Lost Looking Glass”--is a collection of research notes written by Taliesin, and organized into a book by one of his friends.
    I had a devil-wevil of a time finding it.${prompt}
  9150: Taliesin fell victim to a deadly illness before he managed to finish his research.${prompt}
  9151: |-
    I bet he was really peevy-weeved to leave things undone like that.
    I'm something of a researcher myself, so I can imagine the frustration.${prompt}
  9152: |-
    Maybe the desire to continue his work has cursed him to wander the world as a ghost!
    I justaru love horror stories...${prompt}
  9153: |-
    Ahem. Anyway, there are many passages on the Glass of Blessed Radiance in here.
    It truly was a beautiful piece...${prompt}
  9154: During that incident in Jugner Forest, a blinding light poured out from the mirror to envelop everything in an incandescent glow.${prompt}
  9155: Could that light have been...?${prompt}
  9156: That light...?${prompt}
  9157: Justaru like the glow of the Glass of Blessed Radiance was described in Taliesin's notes!${prompt}
  9158: |-
    But how could this be?
    Its power is meantaru to be sealed within a lake of ice--a place in the northeast of Beaucedine Glacier known as “Mirror Pond.”${prompt}
  9159: There is a tale that says the seal is protected by the spirit of a mirror guardian.${prompt}
  9160: 'If you burn ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} and ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} on top of a slab of ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} by the shores of the lake, the spirit is supposed to become visible.${prompt}'
  9161: 'To gather-wather these items, you need a few different tools: ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  9162: I wanted to try it myself as partaru of my research, but there were too many nasty-wasties roaming the area.${prompt}
  9163: Hmm...${prompt}
  9164: So. How about you find this pond of ice and have a chat with the resident spirit about the Glass of All-Seeing?${prompt}
  9165: The spirit of a guardian...?${prompt}

  9290: To tell the truth, I doubted the powers of the mirror at first.${prompt}
  9291: But after listening to Palometa's story, I was glad that I trusted in the Glass of All-Seeing.${prompt}
  9292: Looking back, these past events have been just the kind of excitement I needed.${prompt}
  9293: The mirror is a great treasure--that's for sure!${prompt}

  9310: When the bearer of the Mirror of Blighted Gloom meets the wielder of the Glass of Blessed Radiance, something huge is supposed to happen.${prompt}
  9311: The power I felt was a premonition of the brewing storm.${prompt}
  9312: Looking back, that story was almost prophetic.${prompt}

  9327: I wonder if the guiding power of the mirror was born from these people's thoughts.${prompt}
  9328: What could they possibly be trying to lead us to?${prompt}
  9329: In any event, the Glass of All-Seeing has taken me on an amazing journey.${prompt}

  9356: One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt}
  9357: One, an entity of “light.”${prompt}
  9358: Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt}
  9359: The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.${prompt}
  9360: |-
    One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.
    One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt}
  9361: |-
    And thus we pray.
    To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt}
  9362: When I heard this story for the first time, a tingle ran down my spine...${prompt}
  9363: I felt as though the Glass of All-Seeing had guided me all my life to arrive at that very moment.${prompt}
  9364: I just knew that a life-changing experience had been set in motion.${prompt}
  9365: Since arriving in Jeuno, I've met so many people and survived so many incidents, I'm starting to lose track.${prompt}
  9366: 'But there is one thing I''ll never forget: the time we first met.${prompt}'
  9367: You appeared before me at the Eldieme Necropolis, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9368: |-
    This might sound a little exaggerated, but never before had I felt destiny so keenly.
    It was as though the mirror wanted me to meet you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9369: I almost heard it whisper, “your future lies with this person.”${prompt}
  9370: |-
    Sounds incredible, doesn't it?
    But it's true.${prompt}
  9371: |-
    I've never enjoyed adventuring as much as when I'm with you, ${name-player}.
    I simply cannot recall how I managed to get by until we met.${prompt}
  9372: Promise me we'll be friends forever, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9373: At first, I was only interested in the Glass of All-Seeing's beauty.${prompt}
  9374: But over time, the images it showed me became the focus of my journey.${prompt}
  9375: Following its guidance led me to you, Luto, and Palometa.${prompt}
  9376: I'm so glad Palometa was able to regain her father's mirror.${prompt}
  9377: And I'm also thrilled that the blessed radiance was restored to my looking glass.${prompt}
  9378: A feat I couldn't have accomplished without your help.${prompt}
  9379: ${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa told us?${prompt}
  9380: Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt}
  9381: One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt}
  9382: One, an entity of “light.”${prompt}
  9383: Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt}

    One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.
    One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt}
  9386: |-
    And thus we pray.
    To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt}
  9387: I think we were swept up in the storm mentioned in that tale.${prompt}
  9388: And that awful man was at the center of it all.${prompt}
  9389: Can we assume that the mirrors are safe now that our opponent has been defeated?${prompt}
  9390: |-
    I certainly hope so.
    And I hope Palometa will know peace in her life from now on.${prompt}
  9391: She's seen so much strife for one so young...${prompt}
  9392: We've been traveling together for so long now that I don't think I can go back to being alone.${prompt}
  9393: But you'll keep adventuring alongside me, won't you, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  9394: I know you'll never let me down.${prompt}
  9395: Luto mentioned something about the rarity of the Glass of All-Seeing.${prompt}
  9396: But who would've thought that it concealed the power to counter the Mirror of Blighted Gloom?${prompt}
  9397: ${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa told us?${prompt}
  9398: Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt}
  9399: One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt}
  9400: One, an entity of “light.”${prompt}
  9401: Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.${prompt}
  9402: The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.${prompt}
  9403: |-
    One shard of the storm glittered in the sky.
    One shard of the storm shone below the earth.${prompt}
  9404: |-
    And thus we pray.
    To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt}
  9405: Well, these events haven't exactly been a storm, but I wonder if these two powerful objects were ever responsible for starting any wars...${prompt}
  9406: When I think that this mirror may hold powers beyond my understanding...I get a little nervous about holding on to it.${prompt}
  9407: |-
    But of course, I'm not gonna give it up!
    There are too many amazing memories...${prompt}
  9408: Whatever this mirror shows in the future, I hope we can gaze into its mysteries together.${prompt}
  9409: Don't worry, I'll be keeping this wonderful treasure around!${prompt}
  9410: ${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa told us?${prompt}
  9411: Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt}
  9412: One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt}
  9413: One, an entity of “light.”${prompt}

  9417: |-
    And thus we pray.
    To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt}
  9418: |-
    People always grow to desire anything that transcends the ordinary.
    I was no different...${prompt}
  9419: But then I found the Glass of All-Seeing...${prompt}
  9420: And when I realized the power I held in my hands, I grew afraid.${prompt}
  9421: Ever since I began adventuring with you, however...${prompt}
  9422: '...I''ve been able to forget about that fear.${prompt}'
  9423: You've been a guiding force in my life.${prompt}
  9424: And it's thanks to you that I can bear this incredible treasure with a sense of wonder.${prompt}
  9425: I don't know how to express my gratitude...${prompt}
  9426: Thank you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9427: Know that I'll always be around to help in your adventures.${prompt}
  9428: I'll be ready and waiting for your call.${prompt}
  9429: ${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa told us?${prompt}
  9430: Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt}
  9431: One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt}

  9436: |-
    And thus we pray.
    To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt}
  9437: The Glass of All-Seeing is the thing that brought us together.${prompt}
  9438: But if the true force guiding me was the connection between the two mirrors...${prompt}
  9439: '...Then the end of my journey was Palometa.${prompt}'
  9440: I couldn't believe it when we learned she was gonna be the guardian of her father's mirror.${prompt}
  9441: I felt a little sad as well.${prompt}
  9442: But even though you're not the person I was fated to meet, you're still an irreplaceable part of my life.${prompt}
  9443: So, listen up!${prompt}
  9444: I want us to keep on adventuring together.${prompt}
  9445: Our meeting may have been pure chance...${prompt}
  9446: But I'm glad you were there at the end of my path.${prompt}
  9447: And nothing is ever gonna change that!${prompt}
  9448: I have been thinking about the Glass of All-Seeing.${prompt}
  9449: ${name-player}, do you remember the story that Palometa recited?${prompt}
  9450: Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt}
  9451: One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt}
  9452: One, an entity of “light.”${prompt}

  9456: |-
    And thus we pray.
    To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt}
  9457: Personally, I believe this tale to be an abstract description of how new things are born when people come together.${prompt}
  9458: And when that new thing has the power to reach the heavens, it will truly be treasured.${prompt}
  9459: The Glass of All-Seeing was responsible for bringing us together.${prompt}
  9460: Yet even if our meeting was not of our own design...${prompt}
  9461: '...I value the time we have been given.${prompt}'
  9462: I will never forget what we have accomplished.${prompt}
  9463: Our adventures are priceless to me, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9464: And I hope that we continue to have them...${prompt}
  9465: ${name-player}, do you still remember Palometa's story?${prompt}
  9466: Once there was a meeting of two great masses.${prompt}
  9467: One, an entity of “dark.”${prompt}

  9472: |-
    And thus we pray.
    To hold both shards within our hands...${prompt}
  9473: I interpret this to be a story about the greatness of chance meetings.${prompt}
  9474: |-
    There are chance meetings the value of which is comparable to the rarest of treasures.
    I think you'll agree.${prompt}
  9475: It was through the Glass of All-Seeing's power, not mere chance, that we were able to meet, you and I.${prompt}
  9476: Without the mirror's guidance, I daresay our paths may never have crossed.${prompt}
  9477: However, this in no way detracts from the importance I place in our friendship.${prompt}
  9478: I am grateful the mirror led us together, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9479: I thought you should know that.${prompt}
  9480: I look forward to your company for many more adventures to come...${prompt}
  9481: You feel the bonds between you and your adventuring fellow strengthen!${prompt}

    Airships are prohibited from flying in the skies above the Aht Urhgan Empire.
    If you want to visit the Near East, by sea is the only way to go!${prompt}
  9484: Port Al Zahbi must be packed with all the people coming and going by ship, like Jeuno and Tavnazia used to be!${prompt}
  9485: |-
    Well, let me take a look at this Near Eastern cookbook I just got.
    It says “soup” is called “corbasi,” and the secret to a delicious dish is...${prompt}
  9486: 'Why, the secret is to simmer it in a ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}, of course!${prompt}'
  9487: |-
    Jeuno is different from the other nations.
    I actually kind of enjoy watching everyone squabble with each other.${prompt}
  9488: I can't imagine why anyone would want to go all the way to the Near East and become a mercenary.${prompt}
  9489: I heard that the Near East is bursting at the seams with wonderful treasures never seen this side of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  9490: I can't figure out which sounds more interesting--the Tenshodo or the Near East...${prompt}
  9491: You have shiny badge.${prompt}
  9492: |-
    I don't have shiny badge.
    Very, very sad.${prompt}
  9493: Verena sensed that Lion was alive somewhere.${prompt}
  9494: I really wanted to believe her, but deep down I was convinced that we'd never see Lion again.${prompt}
  9495: You're one of a kind...${prompt}
  9496: Adventurers are more than simple sellswords looking to fight the next new monster in the next new land to bring home the newest treasure.${prompt}
  9497: |-
    You fulfill the dreams that others have given up on.
    That's what makes a true adventurer.${prompt}

    Fighting with the ancients.
    Battling the Emptiness.${prompt}
  9499: For someone who stands at the peak of their adventuring career, I may be bringing up old news.${prompt}
  9500: But we will never forget. And there are others, too, who had given up on their dreams--they will remember you.${prompt}
  9501: So you should go to Norg. Go and see Lion.${prompt}
  9502: So you should go.${prompt}
  9503: There's someone waiting for you, am I right?${prompt}
  9504: You don't talk much, and I won't ask you about what happened beneath the light of that great, burning crystal.${prompt}
  9505: |-
    I'm just happy to have Lion back among us.
    If you head to Norg, you might even be able to see her.${prompt}
  9506: I'm just happy to have Lion back among us.${prompt}
  9507: |-
    The boss sure is cheerful these days.
    He was putting on a show before so we wouldn't worry, but I've known him too long to fall for that.${prompt}
  9508: He won't say anything about what happened. But that spark is back in his eye, and that's enough for me! Things are about to get interesting!${prompt}
  9509: |-
    Are you telling me that Lion's back?
    Where the hell has she been? She's lucky I don't give her what for.${prompt}
  9510: |-
    Lion...
    She really had us worried!${prompt}
  9511: |-
    What's going on?
    The boss is walking around like he's seen the Gates of Paradise, or something.${prompt}
  9512: |-
    He always gets like that when you're around.
    I don't get it, you don't look that special to me.
    It's starting to give me the heebie-jeebies...${prompt}
  9513: Faire partie du Tenshodo signifie que tu vendrais ton âme pour la bonne somme de gil.${prompt}
  9514: De plus, prendre des risques est bon pour les affaires, je dis toujours.${prompt}
  9515: Cette fois, nous avons un client spécial, donc on ne peut pas aller bavarder des détails de sa demande à n'importe qui.${prompt}
  9516: Apprendre une telle chose pourrait rendre notre client un peu furieux, et nous ne voudrions certainement pas ça.${prompt}
  9517: C'est pourquoi j'ai mélangé les commandes avec des bribes d'informations aléatoires et je ne donne que des morceaux à la fois. Ceux d'entre vous qui ont du bon sens devraient pouvoir tout reconstituer, c'est ce que je pense.${prompt}
  9518: Je dirais même que tu pourrais bien entrer dans cette catégorie, toi aussi.${prompt}
  9519: |-
    Bref, c'est ainsi que les choses se présentent pour le moment.
    Alors, de quoi as-tu besoin ? Parle maintenant.${prompt}
  9520: |-
    Demander quoi ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Marchandises à vendre.
    Rien.
     ${prompt}
  9521: |-
    On dirait que je me suis trompé à ton sujet.
    Bref, si tu veux acheter des marchandises, va voir Ghebi Damomohe à l'entrée ou parle simplement aux deux à la réception.${prompt}
  9522: C'est tout ce que j'ai à te dire. Maintenant, sors d'ici et laisse-moi faire mes affaires en paix.${prompt}
  9523: Si tu n'as besoin de rien, qu'est-ce que tu fiches ici, au départ ?${prompt}
  9524: |-
    Eh bien, je dois dire que tu es encore plus intelligent que tu n'en as l'air.
    Tu es arrivé ici de la même manière, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9525: 'Ces derniers temps, les gens ont semé des ${item-plural: 0[2]} comme s''il n''y avait pas de lendemain, donc beaucoup de membres du Tenshodo ne connaissent pas ce truc.${prompt}'
  9526: Bien sûr, le patron et moi, on est sur un tout autre niveau de réflexion.${prompt}
  9527: Pourtant, l'idée de "voir l'invisible" était l'un des principaux attraits du Tenshodo pour moi au début. J'ai de grands espoirs pour toi...${prompt}
  9528: Hein ?${prompt}
  9529: Ah, désolé. J'ai oublié la partie la plus importante, n'est-ce pas ? Désolé de t'avoir laissé en suspens.${prompt}
  9530: |-
    Euh... Qu'est-ce que je disais, déjà ?
    Ah, oui... l'Empire d'Aht Urhgan. Tu veux voir le Proche-Orient, non ? Je le vois dans tes yeux.${prompt}
  9531: |-
    Qu'en penses-tu, d'Aht Urhgan ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Je veux y aller !
    Pff, pas intéressé.
     ${prompt}
  9532: Heheh, j'apprécie ton honnêteté.${prompt}
  9533: C'est donc ça ? C'est tout ce que j'ai à te dire alors, va-t'en.${prompt}
  9534: Eh bien, tu es malin, dis donc ? Mais une fois suffit. Sérieusement.${prompt}
  9535: Bref, assez tourné autour du pot pour le moment. Plongeons directement dans les détails croustillants, d'accord ?${prompt}
  9536: Tu sais, les navires à Mhaura qui transportaient des mercenaires potentiels vers le Proche-Orient ? Si tu veux monter à bord de l'un de ces vaisseaux, tu dois passer par le Tenshodo ici.${prompt}
  9537: Nous avons reçu une demande de l'Empire lui-même. Faire accoster ces navires était une vraie galère. Nous avons finalement réussi à négocier un prix bas pour quelques vieux rafiots, et...${prompt}
  9538: Et ça ne t'intéresse pas. Désolé pour ça. Un homme doit parfois se défouler.${prompt}
  9539: Bref, tu devrais maintenant savoir comment ça fonctionne ici. Si tu veux quelque chose, tu dois d'abord m'apporter quelque chose que je veux.${prompt}
  9540: Si tu n'es pas d'humeur à chercher ce que je veux, tu peux toujours payer en gil. Bien sûr, ce serait le plus rapide.${prompt}
  9541: Faisons cette explication brève, d'accord ?${prompt}
  9542: Tu vois, les prix sont un peu différents dans le Proche-Orient. Quelque chose qui se vend ici pour un gil la douzaine pourrait être un article de luxe à Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  9543: |-
    Allons droit au but, maintenant.
    Je veux que tu m'apportes des objets courants de ce côté de Vana'diel, et en échange, je te donnerai le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  9544: Plus t'en apportes, mieux c'est. J'ai préparé quelques listes si tu veux y jeter un œil. Je te laisse choisir ce que tu m'apportes.${prompt}
  9545: |-
    Ah oui, et il y a aussi le gil. Bien sûr.
    Tu peux aussi choisir de payer pour t'en sortir.${prompt}
  9546: 'Si tu décides d''opter pour le paiement en gil, j''aurai besoin de ${number: 0} gil d''avance. Ce n''est rien pour les aventuriers de nos jours, non ? Considère ça comme ton prix d''échec, heheh.${prompt}'
  9547: |-
    Alors, qu'est-ce que ce sera ?
    Je vais lire la liste maintenant, décide de quel ensemble tu peux te permettre et note ce dont tu as besoin.${prompt}
  9548: |-
    Qu'est-ce que ce sera ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Liste pour débutants.
    Liste intermédiaire.
    Liste avancée.
    Payer les ${number: 0} gil.
    Explique encore, s'il te plaît.
    Laisse-moi y réfléchir.${prompt}
  9549: Ça va te demander un peu d'effort si tu veux aller à Aht Urhgan, mais tu ne peux pas y aller sans notre aide.${prompt}
  9550: Heh heh heh...${prompt}
  9551: |-
    La liste avancée, hein ? Un excellent choix. Les objets sur cette liste sont peu nombreux, donc ils devraient bien s'intégrer dans ton sac, mais ils sont assez difficiles à obtenir.
    Tu peux choisir parmi les suivants :${prompt}
  9552: Une clé de coffre d'une forteresse de bête - Davoi, Beadeaux, Château Oztroja, le Temple d'Uggalepih, le Repaire de la Rancœur, les Cavernes de Sable Mouvant, ou la Grotte du Serpent de Mer.${prompt}
  9553: Un “témoignage”. Ces anciens morceaux de papyrus semblent très populaires parmi les collectionneurs ces jours-ci. Je ne connais pas tous les détails, mais apparemment, il y a un témoignage pour chaque métier d'aventurier. Bref, j'en ai juste besoin d'un.${prompt}
  9554: Ta dernière option est d'apporter des jetons de Pso'Xja.${prompt}
  9555: 'J''aurai besoin d''un ensemble de ceux-ci, cependant. Tu devras m''apporter ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, les trois.${prompt}'
  9556: |-
    C'est tout pour la liste avancée.
    Tu peux m'apporter l'un des objets demandés ci-dessus, mais si tu décides d'apporter des jetons de Pso'Xja, j'en aurai besoin d'un set de trois.${prompt}
  9557: |-
    Intermédiaire, hein ?
    Ça va être assez embêtant.${prompt}
  9558: Les bêtes ont été un vrai fléau pour le Proche-Orient ces derniers temps. Pas que nous n'ayons pas eu de problèmes ici aussi.${prompt}
  9559: Mais bref, la situation a fait augmenter la demande pour les butins de bête.${prompt}
  9560: 'Je veux que tu m''apportes ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  9561: Les bêtes les utilisent pour transmettre des ordres. J'ai besoin des trois.${prompt}
  9562: |-
    C'est tout pour la liste intermédiaire.
    Ça peut avoir l'air simple, mais ces objets sont dispersés dans les forteresses et sont plutôt difficiles à obtenir.${prompt}
  9563: Tu veux aller à Aht Urhgan, mais tu es trop peureux pour relever un défi, hein ? Cette attitude ne te mènera nulle part dans l'Empire, je te le dis. Bon, peu importe, tant que je fais un profit.${prompt}
  9564: Ça ressemblera plus à faire des commissions, mais il y a beaucoup de choses à collecter sur cette liste.${prompt}
  9565: 'Il y a beaucoup d''objets curieux ici. J''ai besoin que tu m''apportes ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  9566: |-
    Attends, il y a plus. J'ai aussi besoin de ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} et ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}. 
    ...Oh, et une dernière chose--${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}. Apporte-moi ces six objets en même temps, et je serai satisfait.${prompt}
  9567: |-
    Hoho !
    Donc cet aventurier hautain refuse de se rabaisser à faire des commissions !${prompt}
  9568: |-
    Ah, désolé pour ça.${wait-36: 1}
    Je ne me moque pas de toi, donc ne t'énerve pas.${prompt}
  9569: 'Donc tu vas me payer ${number: 0} gil. C''est bien ça ?${prompt}'
  9570: Tu ne recevras pas le permis immédiatement, tu sais. Ça te va ?${prompt}
  9571: |-
    Payer ${number: 0} gil pour le permis ?
    ${selection-lines}
    En y repensant, non.
    Oui.${prompt}
  9572: Tu ne le regretteras pas plus tard, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9573: |-
    Sois honnête.
    ${selection-lines}
    Maintenant que tu le dis...
    Regret ? Je ne connais pas ce mot !${prompt}
  9574: |-
    Bon sang ! Tu n'as que ${number: 6} gil ?${wait-36: 2}
    Reviens quand tes poches seront un peu plus garnies !${prompt}
  9575: |-
    Félicitations, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame], on a un marché !
    Reviens demain et je te donnerai le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}

  9577: '${color-alt: 138}Tu payes Faursel ${number: 0} gil !${prompt}'
  9578: |-
    Exactement ce que j'ai demandé !
    Félicitations, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame], on a un marché !
    Reviens demain et je te donnerai le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  9579: Et ne t'inquiète pas, parce que le Tenshodo tient ses promesses !${prompt}
  9580: |-
    Ce qui est fait est fait. Désolé, mais je ne fais pas de remboursements.
    Reviens demain et je te donnerai le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  9581: |-
    Bonne journée à toi.

    Moblin Maze Mongers is the revolutionary new business venture that's taking Vana'diel by storm!
    Making ingenious use of previously neglected caverns beneath Mindartia and Quon, our expert staff will create the perfect dungeon for you and your fellow adventurers!${prompt}
  9809: Use one of our state-of-the-art “Maze Tabulae” to lay out the guidelines, and sit back as our craftsmen dig and delve to your demanding specifications!${prompt}
  9810: Your maze will also be populated with a plethora of foul fiends and all manner of devious devices, all of which can also be customized to your liking!${prompt}
  9811: |-
    The maze you design may be a relaxed jaunt for the novice adventurer, or it may be a diabolical demesne that will challenge even the most battle-hardened adventurers.
    With control over almost every aspect of your creation, the choice is yours!${prompt}
  9812: |-
    So what are you waiting for?
    Let Moblin Maze Mongers build you the maze of your dreams--or nightmares--today!${prompt}
  9813: |-
    Moblin Maze Mongers makes designing your own dungeon quick and painless!
    With three simple-to-use items--“Maze Tabulae,” “Maze Vouchers,” and “Maze Runes”--you'll be a mazebuilding master in no time.${prompt}
  9814: The first and most important of these items is the “Maze Tabula,” which stores the layout and content of your maze. By using other items in conjunction with the Maze Tabula, you can customize various elements of your dungeon.${prompt}
  9815: Next you have the “Maze Voucher,” a construction order that specifies the objectives that must be met to successfully complete your maze.${prompt}
  9816: |-
    After receiving your Maze Voucher, we will proceed to build a maze according to your specifications.
    However, the Maze Voucher only dictates the final objectives for your dungeon--other details may be left to the whims of our craftsmen.${prompt}
  9817: |-
    You'd rather customize the nitty-gritty details yourself, you say? Fear not!
    That's where “Maze Runes” come in.
    The use of Maze Runes is completely optional, and is intended for detail-oriented adventurers who want more direct control over their creation.${prompt}
  9818: |-
    Be aware, however, that certain combinations of Maze Runes and Maze Vouchers are incompatible with each other, while others might produce unintended effects.
    Still, the possibilities are nearly limitless, so clients are encouraged to experiment!${prompt}
  9819: You may notice that certain Maze Tabulae contain blackened squares, or squares containing elemental symbols.${prompt}
  9820: |-
    Black squares indicate squares that cannot hold Maze Runes.
    Please manipulate your Maze Runes as necessary so that they do not touch any black squares.${prompt}
  9821: |-
    Elemental squares will enhance the effect of any Maze Runes they come in contact with.
    Such Maze Runes will exert a far greater influence on your maze than under typical circumstances.${prompt}
  9822: |-
    The concept of elemental opposition does not apply to the Maze Tabula.
    Provided that at least one compatible element exists, the Maze Rune in question will see its effect augmented.${prompt}
  9823: After customizing your dungeon with the three items described above, please trade your completed Maze Tabula to the Maze Monger Shopfront.${prompt}
  9824: Once your Maze Tabula is confirmed and you've paid the necessary excavation and construction fee, you and your companions will be escorted posthaste to your brand-spanking new, custom-built maze!${prompt}
  9825: 'Customers should know that due to high demand for the Maze Mongers'' services, only one maze order can be accepted from any single adventurer per ${choice: 0}[twenty hours/one hour] (Earth time).${prompt}'
  9826: |-
    However, there are no restrictions placed on using mazes created by other adventurers.
    Adventurers who would like to take on multiple mazes a day are strongly encouraged to cooperate with their friends.${prompt}
  9827: This section will explain the procedure for adventuring in your custom-built maze from start to finish, entrance to exit!${prompt}
  9828: |-
    After your order has been accepted and paid for, you and your companions will be escorted to the maze lobby.
    Please wait here patiently until the construction process is completed.${prompt}
  9829: |-
    During this time, our lead foreman Packapic will provide you with a brief overview of the facilities.
    You will also be given the opportunity to purchase maze-specific items should you so desire.${prompt}
  9830: |-
    After construction has completed, our gatekeeper and guide Rediroq will lead you and your companions into the maze.
    The challenge begins!${prompt}
  9831: "Should you manage to successfully complete the conditions specified on the Maze Voucher, a treasure chest will appear somewhere within the maze. \nWhat myriad riches may lie inside? You'll just have to see for yourself!${prompt}"
  9832: |-
    After successfully retrieving your reward, you are free to exit the maze.
    You may do so by any one of the following methods:${prompt}
  9833: "”Leaving From the Exit”\nEach maze will contain an exit door with a Maze Monger attendant posted in the vicinity. \nIf spoken to, this attendant will lead all participants out of the maze.${prompt}"
  9834: Located near the exit is a beacon. Attendants have been instructed to trigger this as soon as the maze objectives have been successfully met, so you may use it as a guide in the event that you are unsure of your progress.${prompt}
  9835: |-
    “Using a ${item-singular: 0[2]}”
    A complimentary ${item-singular: 0[2]} will be presented to you free of charge before you enter the maze.
    Using this will cause the adventurer who used it--and that person alone--to be transported out of the maze.${prompt}
  9836: |-
    “Emergency Extraction”
    Should unforeseen circumstances occur that are deemed to present an imminent danger to maze participants, Moblin Maze Mongers staff reserve the right to perform an emergency rescue operation to remove all participants from the maze.${prompt}
  9837: |-
    Now you have all the necessary knowledge to enjoy your custom maze!
    Happy spelunking!${prompt}
  9838: Clients should be aware of the following rules and regulations governing the use of Maze Monger mazes.${prompt}
  9839: Adventurers who flee from a given maze without completing the stated objectives will not be permitted to re-enter that same maze.${prompt}
  9840: |-
    Upon completing the objectives, a treasure chest is guaranteed to appear somewhere within the maze.
    Please do not forget to seek it out and claim your reward before exiting the dungeon.${prompt}
  9841: "Maze difficulty will, in principle, be tailored to the highest level adventurer in the event that a party contains adventurers of disparate skill levels. \nNote, however, that there may be exceptions to this depending on the objectives specified on your Maze Voucher.${prompt}"
  9842: |-
    We at Moblin Maze Mongers strongly encourage building and exploring mazes in parties.
    While we will not refuse solo clients, please be aware that completing the maze objectives alone may prove to be a difficult task.${prompt}
  9843: "Our expert craftsmen take the highest pride in the safety and stability of their work. \nPlease understand, however, that due to the inherent tectonic instability of subterranean caverns, we cannot rule out the possibility of collapses or cave-ins occurring over the course of time.${prompt}"
  9844: |-
    In such cases, we reserve the right to initiate emergency rescue operations that will instantly transport all clients outside the maze to safety.
    Moblin Maze Mongers will accept no responsibility for treasures left unclaimed as a result of such a rescue operation, so adventurers are encouraged--for their own benefit--to proceed through the maze in a timely fashion.${prompt}
  9845: In addition to the treasures to be gained within mazes, adventurers will also receive special tokens called “Moblin Marbles” as a reward for the successful completion of a maze.${prompt}
  9846: These Moblin Marbles can be exchanged at the Maze Mongers office for a wide variety of exciting, exclusive goods and prizes!${prompt}
  9847: How about a nice, shiny one of these?${prompt}
  9848: Or a spiffy, sparkling one of these?${prompt}
  9849: Rack up enough Moblin Marbles, and there's a veritable cornucopia of prizes to be had!${prompt}
  9850: |-
    And that's not all--Moblin Marbles can also be used to purchase other benefits!
    These include the ability to register your completed Maze Tabulae and share your creations with adventurers far and wide, or an assortment of official designations.${prompt}
  9851: Accumulate as many as you can and make the most of your maze-mongering experience!${prompt}
  9852: |-
    There's only one copy, so don't ye go carryin' it off now.
    Jus' come back here if ye need t'look at it again.${prompt}
  9853: |-
    Hmmmm...so ye want t'order a maze, do ye?${wait-36: 1}
    Sorry, but our mazes aren't fer you greenhorn types.
    Come back when ye've seen more of the world, why don't ye?${prompt}
  9854: |-
    Thanks to the loyal patronage of adventurers like you, business is positively booming here at Moblin Maze Mongers!
    We've been so successful, in fact, that unscrupulous rival corporations have sprung up trying to cash in on our profits!${prompt}
  9855: |-
    With great success, though, comes great responsibility!
    Here at Moblin Maze Mongers, we are dedicated to preserving the pristine subterranean environment that makes our unique service possible.
    Regrettably, this means there are times when we must temporarily close our mazes for necessary maintenance.${prompt}
  9856: |-
    At the same time, Moblin Maze Mongers always puts you, the customer, first!
    How can we reward our loyal customers for their part in keeping our caves clean and tectonically sound?
    Here's how: with our all-new Cave Conservation (C.C.) point system!${prompt}
  9857: "Customers will receive their first C.C. point ${choice: 0}[thirty-two hours/one hour and twenty minutes] (Earth time) after exiting a maze they have created, with another point being added every ${choice: 0}[eight hours/twenty minutes] (Earth time) thereafter. \nA maximum of six points may be accumulated at any one time.${prompt}"
  9858: |-
    And what will C.C. points earn you? More loot, that's what!
    Ordering a maze with C.C. points in your possession will result in the appearance of an additional, bonus treasure chest upon completion of your objectives! The contents will vary based upon your Maze Voucher, with greater riches awaiting you for each C.C. point you've accumulated.${prompt}
  9859: |-
    Please be aware that your C.C. points will be reset to zero upon ordering a new maze.
    Any treasure that goes unclaimed will revert to the property of Moblin Maze Mongers. No returns, no refunds.${prompt}

  9940: Now, before-ethy I proceed, please be reminded that not a single word spoken here today must be allowed to leave-ethy this room.${prompt}
  9941: If what my investigation has revealed is true-ethy, we have a major crisis looming.${prompt}
  9942: A teleportation mishap-ethy has resulted in the creation of a clone-ethy of Doctor Shantotto!${prompt}
  9943: Wh-what? As if one Doctor Shantotto wasn't already a handful, now we have to contend with two!?${prompt}
  9944: Of all the Goddess-forsaken incidents...${prompt}
  9945: And to rub-ethy salt into the wound, the evil tendencies exhibited by the newly created clone are such-ethy that they put the original doctor to shame-ethy!${prompt}
  9946: |-
    “Domina Shantotto,” she has taken-ethy to calling herself, though this you may already know-ethy.

    Had only I heeded Principal Koru-Moru's warnings...
    Oh, the Goddess strike-ethy me down for a fool!${prompt}
  9950: To avoid raising alarm bells, we've planted a life-size talking doll-ethy of the doctor at her abode and imbued it with a personality that's equally abrasive-ethy, but the people won't be fooled for long.${prompt}
  9951: We must act, and act fast-ethy, lest all of this becomes public knowledge and mass panic-ethy grips the land!${prompt}
  9952: Certainly not the kind of predicament you want to get dragged into should you wish to live to a ripe old age...
  9953: But as much as I'm loath to admit it, we--myself and all adventurers included--are already involved up to our necks.${prompt}
  9954: Whatever devious scheme that Domina Shantotto is plotting, it would be naive to assume that she has any less than the whole of Vana'diel in her sights.${prompt}
  9955: Now, I think it's safe to say that we're all agreed that action must be taken.${prompt}
  9956: But what should our first step be to avert this clear and present danger?${prompt}
  9957: Let me first tell-ethy you what else I know.${prompt}
  9958: Upon learning of the teleportation mishap-ethy, I sought to locate the whereabouts of the original-ethy Doctor Shantotto. I deduced that the clone-ethy might have had a hand in her disappearance.${prompt}
  9959: And sure-ethy enough, my sources have revealed that the original doctor is being held captive-ethy somewhere in Ro'Maeve.${prompt}
  9960: I propose-ethy that our first act is the rescue of “Original Shantotto”--for the sake of convenience, let's call-ethy her by this moniker for the time being.${prompt}
  9961: 'Ah, I see where you''re going with this: fight fire with fire!${prompt}'
  9962: It sounds like our best bet. The odds would be greatly improved if we had the original Shantotto fighting on our side.${prompt}
  9963: ${name-player}, I trust I can rely on your full cooperation in this.${prompt}
  9964: Let's be on our way!${prompt}
  9965: I trust I can rely on your full cooperation in rescuing the original Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  9966: According to Professor Yoran-Oran, the doctor is being held captive in Ro'Maeve.${prompt}
  9967: “A perfect world order...${prompt}

  9970: |-
    <Puff...wheeze...>
    Th-the doctor's location-ethy! I have it!${prompt}
  9971: As a last resort, I employed the services of Windurst's infamous Cat Burglar-ethy, Nanaa Mihgo, to locate Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  9972: 'And true-ethy to her reputation, she''s successfully tracked down the doctor''s current hideout-ethy: the Sacrificial Chamber within the Temple of Uggalepih!${prompt}'
  9973: The only hitch-ethy is--and acquiring this piece of information further lightened my coin purse-ethy--ancient artifacts known as “Tablets of Hexes” are required for entry. They can supposedly be found-ethy scattered throughout the temple and deeper within.${prompt}
  9974: Ah, yes. The Cat Burglar has never been one to lose scent of her prey.${prompt}
  9975: So the next leg of our journey takes us to Elshimo Island...${prompt}
  9976: By means fair or foul, we must put an end to Shantotto's nefarious plot.${prompt}
  9977: Vana'diel must not be allowed to fall into such tyrannical hands!${prompt}
  9978: |-
    But first, there are matters I must attend to in Jeuno.
    I must ensure that the Tenshodo isn't left leaderless should...should the worst come to pass.${prompt}
  9979: One can't expect to lock horns with a fearsome adversary like the doctor and come out unscathed.${prompt}
  9980: Very well-ethy. Let us rendezvous at the Sacrificial Chamber.
  9981: |-
    There are matters I must settle here first before departure.
    The Tenshodo mustn't be left leaderless should the worst come to pass.${prompt}

  10049: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  10050: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  10051: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  10052: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  10053: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  10054: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  10055: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  10056: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  10057: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  10058: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  10059: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  10060: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  10061: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  10062: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  10063: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10064: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  10065: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  10066: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  10067: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  10068: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  10069: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  10070: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  10071: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  10072: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10073: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  10074: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  10075: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  10076: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  10077: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  10078: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  10079: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  10080: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  10081: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  10082: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  10083: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  10084: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  10085: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  10086: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  10087: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  10088: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  10089: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  10090: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  10091: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  10092: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  10093: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  10094: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  10095: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  10096: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  10097: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  10098: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10099: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  10100: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  10101: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  10102: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  10103: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  10104: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  10105: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  10106: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  10107: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  10108: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  10109: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  10110: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  10111: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  10112: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  10113: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  10114: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  10115: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  10116: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  10117: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  10118: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  10119: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  10120: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  10121: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  10122: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  10123: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  10124: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  10125: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  10126: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  10127: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  10128: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  10129: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  10130: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  10131: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  10132: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  10133: |-
    A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know.

    Oh, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too!
    What skills does it require? Let's see here...${prompt}
  10148: |-
    Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!
    Ain't synergy grand?${prompt}
  10149: |-
    Wait! No, don't tell me.
    You strike me as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.${prompt}

    A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living.
    Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.${prompt}
  10152: |-
    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  10153: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  10154: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  10155: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  10156: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  10157: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  10158: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  10159: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  10160: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  10161: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  10162: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}
  10163: |-
    An aspiring synergist, I see!
    If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt}

    As promised, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you!
    How's that for a deal?${prompt}

    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.

  10174: Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt}

    I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.
    Simple as that, kupo!${prompt}

    What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!
    Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt}
  10182: |-
    Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.

    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!
    It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt}

  10186: |-
    If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!
    No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
    Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}
  10187: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt}
  10188: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt}
  10189: |-

  10279: Le gouvernement de Jeuno a promulgué un système permettant aux aventuriers de pionnier des terres inexplorées.${prompt}
  10280: Ce système a été proposé par les dirigeants de la Ville Sacrée d'Adoulin, une capitale commerciale outre-mer dont le volume commercial rivalise avec celui de Jeuno.${prompt}
  10281: Les pionniers doivent traverser les eaux de la Mer de Zafmlug, loin à l'ouest, et aider à coloniser les terres sauvages et indomptées d'Ulbuka.${prompt}
  10282: Une fois que cette proposition est parvenue à San d'Oria par divers itinéraires commerciaux, elle a introduit Jeuno à l'idée, ce qui a conduit à sa mise en œuvre.${prompt}
  10283: Adoulin n'est pas un endroit pour les faibles ou les non-initiés. Des terres sauvages impitoyables entourent la ville, et les simples gens ne peuvent survivre. C'est en raison de ces circonstances uniques qu'Adoulin a commencé à recruter des aventuriers expérimentés pour l'aider à atteindre ses objectifs.${prompt}
  10284: Ici, au Bureau de Consultation, nous délivrons des permis qui permettent aux aventuriers proactifs de se rendre à Adoulin.${prompt}
  10285: Cependant, les néophytes ne peuvent pas fournir les services dont Adoulin a besoin. C'est pourquoi la Chambre a commandé un simple test pour ceux qui cherchent à entreprendre ce voyage périlleux.${prompt}
  10286: Ceux qui sont aguerris au combat devraient trouver cela relativement facile.${prompt}

  10295: Comme vous vous en souvenez peut-être, le test vous demande de visiter l'un des différents donjons.${prompt}
  10296: Pour être tout à fait franc, nous avons reçu un grand nombre de signatures du Réseau d'Aide Mutuelle des Aventuriers. Il est évident qu'avec tous ces aventuriers qui vont et viennent, ils ont aussi besoin d'aide pour des activités non liées au combat.${prompt}
  10297: 'Compte tenu de cela, le comité a délibéré jour et nuit pour trouver une solution. À la suite de cette longue délibération, une décision exécutive a été prise pour délivrer des tickets spéciaux au prix de ${number: 1} gil.${prompt}'
  10298: Le comité a basé son jugement sur l'idée que l'accumulation de fonds est un autre signe d'un aventurier solide.${prompt}

  10311: 'Le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} que je vous ai remis est déjà accordé au point de Bas Jeuno et à l’Adoulin occidental.${prompt}'
  10312: Le passer sur la surface du portail vous permettra de vous téléporter à Adoulin.${prompt}
  10313: Le téléportage n'est cependant pas gratuit ; le processus nécessite un certain type d'énergie.${prompt}
  10314: Selon mes documents, échanger des cristaux contre un point de passage les convertira en énergie. Ce processus s'appelle "chargement".${prompt}
  10315: 'L’énergie, appelée "unités cinétiques", est enregistrée sur le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} que je vous ai donné.${prompt}'
  10316: L'utilisation des points de passage consommera une portion de ces unités cinétiques à chaque fois, je vous recommande donc de les recharger périodiquement.${prompt}

  10471: Very well. As promised, I'll tell you the secret behind the password.${prompt}
  10472: Okay, now listen carefully. The password consists of eight numbers in total, and you need to split it up into four sections of two digits each.${prompt}
  10473: First, you need to take the first three letters of your name and use them to generate a series of two-digit numbers based on their position in the alphabet.${prompt}
  10474: The letter A starts at “00,” B is “01,” and so on, until you reach Z at “25.”${prompt}
  10475: Furthermore, the area containing each device has been assigned an elemental, with each elemental given a numerical code.${prompt}
  10476: If the elemental is Fire, the number is “0,”, while Earth is “1,” until you reach Dark at “7.”${prompt}
  10477: Next, you need to take the value for the elemental and add it to each of your first three numbers. That will give you the first three values.${prompt}
  10478: For the fourth value, you need to add your first three values together and then add the elemental value as well.${prompt}
  10479: If the number exceeds 100, simply take the last two digits.${prompt}
  10480: Therefore, these four sets of numbers you calculated will become your eight-digit password.${prompt}
  10481: 'I suppose it''s still a bit difficult to comprehend. How about an example, then? Say you''re trying to register the password in ${zone: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  10482: 'The first three letters of your name are ${entity: 0}, and the elemental for the device is ${choice: 6}[Fire/Earth/Water/Wind/Ice/Lightning/Light/Dark]...${prompt}'
  10483: 'Therefore, the numerical values for your name are ${number-2-digits: 0}, ${number-2-digits: 1}, and ${number-2-digits: 2}, and the elemental value is ${number: 3}.${prompt}'
  10484: 'That means the first three values are ${number-2-digits: 0}, ${number-2-digits: 1}, and ${number-2-digits: 2}.${prompt}'
  10485: 'The fourth value is created by adding the values for your name to that of the elemental for the area, which gives you ${number-2-digits: 3}.${prompt}'
  10486: 'The fourth value is created by adding the values for your name to that of the elemental for the area, which gives you ${number-2-digits: 4}. However, since it exceeds 100, the value becomes ${number-2-digits: 3}.${prompt}'
  10487: 'Putting all of these values together gives you ${number-2-digits: 0}${number-2-digits: 1}${number-2-digits: 2}${number-2-digits: 3}, which is your password to register your access privileges with the device.${prompt}'

  10687: But now I hear he started teaching-weaching people about Records of Eminence!${prompt}
  10688: He even stopped using his real name. Now he goes by the moniker-woniker “Eternal Flame” or something dumb.${prompt}

  10736: These two just got done entreataruing me to help with an objective.${prompt}
  10737: That's the crrrux of the matter, at least.${prompt}

  10807: Though my heart may swell with fraternal affection for all, it heals no one. Only you can cure the wounds of the masses. That scroll is best in your hands.${prompt}

  10812: In reality, though, <sniffle> you've had me in your heartarus all along... Waaah!${prompt}
  10813: Sorry, Toto. We would've said something to help brace you, but didn't want to spoil the element of surprrrise!${prompt}
  10814: I have to say that I expected our gift to bring a smile to your face, not tears to your eyes.${prompt}
  10815: It's just that...I believed you were avoiding me...so...${prompt}
  10816: I desperately wanted to tell you in advance, but Fhelm was dead set against it!${prompt}
  10817: I had no choice! You'd rrraise the fur on your back and hiss at us if we mentioned anything about a present.${prompt}
  10818: I...I'm touch-wouched. To think that I ever wanted to throw away my life as an adventurer...${prompt}
  10819: I've said so many terrible-werrible things, but...if you'd find it within yourselves to take me back...

  10825: Could you please use a more flattering word like “audacious” or “venturous”? Otherwise, it makes me sound doubly pathetic for almost dying at their hands.${prompt}
  10826: You managed to pry me from death's icy grip, but we still had to flee in order to fight another day.${prompt}

    Hahaha, we sure did.
    I remember having the most heated of argumentarus with you, then crying to Isakoth and Ervok afterwards.${prompt}

  10830: Exploration is the testimony to one's courage. Likewise, Records of Eminence objectives are testimony to mankind's inquisitiveness.${prompt}
  10831: Myriad thoughts, feelings, and recollections are scattered over this vast land. We thus calmly gather them into our arms and release them anew unto the adventuring masses. We pay the price for our meddling, but so too do we reap the rewards. We dare, therefore we are.${prompt}
  10832: I could not have said it better myself!${prompt}
  10833: The influence each of you exerts during your eminent activities may be small in and of itself.${prompt}
  10834: However, those to whom you provide succor deeply appreciate your tireless efforts.${prompt}
  10835: Moreover, you do not provide aid exclusively to single individuals. Entire organizations also place their trust in you.${prompt}
  10836: Many within the A.M.A.N. possess financial resources the average commoner could only dream of. A chance opportunity from one of these individuals could yield untold riches.${prompt}
  10837: It is therefore no stretch of the imagination to say that we are able to subsist due to the noble work ethic of adventurers like you.${prompt}
  10838: In other words...scratch A.M.A.N.'s back, and it will scratch yours.${prompt}
  10839: I could not have said it better myself!${prompt}
  10840: For example, you have also made a pilgrimage to various telepoints scattered about the four corners of Vana'diel and dispersed the darkness that enshrouded the Eldieme Necropolis.${prompt}
  10841: These two objectives were both originally issued by a certain member of the San d'Orian elite.${prompt}
  10842: In contrast, the one Nantoto requested regarding an ouka ranman cannot be described as anything but an abnormality.${prompt}
  10843: 'That was one which I had to work behind the scenes to enact. If my memory serves me, you chose ${zone: 0[2]} as the spot in which to unleash your explosion of memories, correct?${prompt}'
  10844: Heh, fear not, for only you and I know that you consider that place a sanctuary. I will not tell a soul.${prompt}

  10847: ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10848: I can't adequataruly express how much I owe you for taking out those Yagudo!${prompt}
  10849: 'Listen, we''ve all decided-wided to go to ${zone: 0[2]}...${prompt}'
  10850: We want to check on some reportarus concerning a humongous dragon that supposedly patrols the skies there.${prompt}
  10851: We've heard various rumors about a specific locale there where bounding insectarus gather. Hopefully we'll be able to find it.${prompt}
  10852: There's a mountain of hearsay about a flower there that floatarus in midair. I certainly want to see if it's actually real or not.${prompt}
  10853: There you are! I've been looking-wooking all over for you.${prompt}
  10854: I received a couple lettarus addressed to you.${prompt}

    The rainbow one.${prompt}
  10857: I wouldn't open any if I were you, either. You never know what crazy-wazy stuff people deliver these days. I'd feel bad about throwing another person's property away, though, so I'll hold onto them for safekeeping.${prompt}
  10858: Here you go. I hope it doesn't contain anything too suspectaru.${prompt}
  10859: The envelope contains a briefing for a new objective.${prompt}

    And dere's no better feelin' dan takin' trash and turnin' it into treasure. It's pramactically a new kind o' alchemy!

    It has da taste o' a picky peiste--it feasts upon nothin' but da rarest and unique-est o' artifacts.${prompt}

    Lastly, since we don't knows where da items go once inside, ya ain't gettin' nothin' back datcha put in.

  11004: I have a feeling an adventurer of your caliber is more than up to the task. I wish you luck, friend!${prompt}
  11005: 'Stop by anytime and I''ll take any ${item-plural: 0[2]} that you manage to collect.${prompt}'
  11006: When you have saved up enough, you can exchange them for special orbs that contain monsters as well as the aforementioned refurbished goods.${prompt}
  11007: Hahaha! I know what you're thinking... Monsters? Inside of an orb?${prompt}
  11008: From what I hear, the A.M.A.N. recreated the technology behind the orbs that are exchanged for beastmen seals and repurposed it for this occasion.${prompt}
  11009: I guess the monsters are kind of a package deal along with the items! Hahaha!${prompt}
  11010: Although, I suppose you could say it makes the whole process that much more interesting.${prompt}
  11011: At any rate, I'm sure a hearty adventurer like yourself relishes such challenges!${prompt}
  11012: You simply need to take the orbs you obtain here and throw them into the burning circles in Yughott Grotto, the Palborough Mines, and Giddeus in order to remove the seals and cause the orbs' contents to spring forth.${prompt}
  11013: Oh, I should probably mention one more thing. The method for obtaining the contents of the chests is somewhat...unique.${prompt}
  11014: First, a total of one metal chest and ten wooden chests will emerge from the orb, although one of the wooden chests is actually a mimic. That is the monster I was referring to previously.${prompt}
  11015: You will receive the items once you open the metal chest. However, the more wooden chests you open before the metal one, the more items you'll receive!${prompt}
  11016: In other words, the more wooden chests you're able to open while avoiding the mimic, the more goodies you'll get after opening the metal chest!${prompt}
  11017: Obviously, you won't know whether a particular wooden chest is the mimic or not until you open it, so in the end, it pretty much comes down to sheer luck.${prompt}
  11018: '${color-alt: 15}Greyson smiles at you gently.'
  11019: Now then, if you'd like to know more about the orbs or anything else, feel free to ask away.${prompt}
  11020: I'm also more than happy to explain to you the intricacies of rainbow chests, belligerent bangs, and previously used orbs.${prompt}
  11021: Now, now... There's no need to be in such a hurry. Simply hear me out for a moment.${prompt}

  11028: Um... I'm sorry, but you don't have enough money.${prompt}
  11029: I'm sorry, but in order to prevent people from hoarding all of the items, there's a limit on how many vouchers can be purchased within a certain time period. You'll need to wait about one month (Earth time) before buying more.${prompt}

  11033: 'The A.M.A.N. Trove is based on the use of special items such as ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  11034: 'So, you want to know about the difference between ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}...${prompt}'
  11035: 'Basically, the difference comes down to the success rate of obtaining better-quality items. It''s much easier to hit it big and win higher-quality items with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  11036: 'Furthermore, the ${item-singular: 1[2]} ensures that at least one of your items will be of a certain quality.${prompt}'
  11037: Although, I imagine the definition of “quality” differs from person to person, so just think of it as a general guide.${prompt}
  11038: On a separate note, I heard a rumor when I first started that the more you bring to the A.M.A.N., the more items you'll receive.${prompt}
  11039: 'You can obtain ${item-plural: 0[2]} by completing the Records of Eminence objectives I gave you earlier.${prompt}'
  11040: 'And you can always buy them from me, too. However, there is a limit of ${number: 8} vouchers per month (Earth time) in order to prevent people from hoarding all of the items for themselves.${prompt}'
  11041: Among the wooden coffers you come across, a small fraction of them will be shimmering with a prismatic light.${prompt}
  11042: These “rainbow chests“ are sometimes present right from the outset, and they always contain a highly-sought-after reward inside.${prompt}
  11043: Some who have ventured into the trove have reported that if they open eight wooden chests--meaning that the only one left contains a mimic--the remaining chest will be overcome with the selfsame rainbow glow.${prompt}
  11044: Of course, I cannot even begin to fathom how lucky one would have to be for that to actually be the case. Perhaps it's but a rumor.${prompt}
  11045: Ah, yes. The good old belligerent bangs.${prompt}
  11046: The sound that the treasure chest makes when you eagerly open it, flinging the lid open and slamming it onto the back of the chest, has some correlation with whether or not the chest's reward is great, or merely “good.”${prompt}
  11047: Particularly astute adventurers will also note that opening a chest can provide a clue as to whether or not any of the remaining chests have particularly valuable rewards.${prompt}
  11048: However, it takes a few treasure chests to be able to properly triangulate your internal sensing systems. Opening three should be sufficient.${prompt}
  11049: If I could meet whomever or whatever was in charge of crafting these orbs, I would be inclined to give them a good smacking.${prompt}
  11050: But let's keep that between us, hm?${prompt}
  11051: Would you happen to be in possession of any used A.M.A.N. Trove orbs?${prompt}
  11052: The A.M.A.N. believes that littering the ground with used trinkets harms the beauty of the landscape, so we are happy to provide you with proper compensation should you trade me used orbs instead of discarding them.${prompt}
  11053: Who knows? If I'm feeling particularly generous that day, you may get a fresh orb for your troubles.${prompt}
  11054: Hm? You wish to know more about me personally? Well, I used to be an adventurer myself, you see.${prompt}
  11055: I might not look the part, but I fought on the front lines in many strange lands, earning merit points as a warrior, ninja, and various other jobs.${prompt}
  11056: However, I made an important discovery about myself while leading that life.${prompt}
  11057: I found that being forced to do things a certain way all in the name of efficiency kind of defeated the whole purpose of being an adventurer.${prompt}
  11058: I felt that even though it might not always be the best way, it was important to be versatile when it came to party formations, fighting styles, and the like.${prompt}
  11059: When I thought about it like that, I decided to retire and become a merchant in order to help like-minded adventurers in their journeys.${prompt}
  11060: To that end, I purchased items that people no longer needed and looked to sell them in places where they were wanted...${prompt}
  11061: However, I had trouble making ends meet and, as you can see from the looks of me, ended up quite poor. So, with nothing but the clothes on my back, I trudged on until I was introduced to this job by a contact from my adventurer days.${prompt}
  11062: Now, I'm able to at least put food on the table while still realizing my dream of helping other adventurers, so it was all worth it.${prompt}
  11063: 'Of course, I''m happy if I can turn a small profit along the way too, so I''d appreciate it if you could buy some ${item-plural: 0[2]} from me as well!${prompt}'

  11068: Oh, this one hasn't been used yet. Nothing I can do with it.${prompt}
  11069: |-
    Hm? What's that?
    You're lookin' for's some girl, are ya?${prompt}
  11070: |-
    Ah, I know the girl yer talkin' about!
    The one who's here for the Festival of Brave Souls!${prompt}
  11071: |-
    The festival's a very important event for us Goblins.
    It's been around fer ages now.${prompt}
  11072: It's held whenever we Goblins are in danger or the world itself has lost all hope...${prompt}
  11073: The festival helps bring us a sense of calm when we feel like prayin' is our only remainin' option.${prompt}
  11074: |-
    The last time it was held was over several hundred years ago...
    They say there was a battle 'tween the gods of light and darkness.${prompt}
  11075: |-
    Of course, the reason we're holdin' it again now goes without sayin'.
    Countless “World Eater Eggs” are being found across the land.${prompt}
  11076: Yes, I've heard all about you as well.${prompt}
  11077: Ya saved our Goblin heroes from certain death on Zepwell Island, yes?${prompt}
  11078: Even though you're no beastie, ya know just how terrifyin' a “World Eater Egg” from Chaos truly is.${prompt}
  11079: Therefore, you can understand the fear, anxiety, and general unease that we Goblins are feelin', right?${prompt}
  11080: |-
    In fact, it terrifies us beasties so much that many aren't even able to work.
    That's why we need to have this festival--to calm everyone's nerves.${prompt}
  11081: Hm? You wanna know how this girl yer lookin' for's involved with the festival?${prompt}
  11082: |-
    The Festival of Brave Souls is always a sad affair, so I thought it'd be good to prepare somethin' a bit more lighthearted.
    Ya know, to keep up wit' the times and all.${prompt}
  11083: So I put out a call for a skilled entertainer and that girl showed up.${prompt}
  11084: However, she was much weaker than I expected...${prompt}
  11085: So I sent her over to Maat in order to really push her to her limits and get her ready in time fer the festival.${prompt}
  11086: |-
    Huh? She forgot somethin' while she was there?
    And now you're tryin' to give it back to her?${prompt}
  11087: |-
    I see...
    In that case, I suppose it's okay if I tell you her whereabouts...${prompt}
  11088: |-
    According to her, she's always bein' hounded by her many throngs of fans.
    So she asked that I keep her location a secret.${prompt}
  11089: |-
    Although, we've had to shelve our plans to have her perform at the festival.
    I doubt there'll be much to see, let alone any of her fans.${prompt}
  11090: |-
    Here, I'll draw up a map for ya.
    Simply show it to the Tarutaru soldier in front of the Rent-a-Room in Lower Jeuno.${prompt}
  11091: |-
    His name is Miladi-Nildi.
    He can show you where she's stayin'.${prompt}
  11092: |-
    As long as that shadow looms large, we can't have the festival.
    Is there anything that can be done...${prompt}
  11093: |-
    Show that map I drew ya to the soldier standin' in front of the Rent-a-Room in Lower Jeuno.
    His name is Miladi-Nildi.${prompt}
  11094: He can show ya how to find the girl yer lookin' for.${prompt}
  11095: |-
    Oh, this is a rare sightaru indeed. That's a map from a Goblin you're carrying.
    Very well, I can show you the way.${prompt}
  11096: |-
    Hello! Do you come bearing yet more gifts from my legions of adoring fans?
    You can just set them down over there.${prompt}
  11097: |-
    How will you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    You forgot this!
    I'm a huge fan!
    Firesday Night Fever!${prompt}
  11098: Huh!? I-it can't be!${prompt}
  11099: Wh-where did you find this!?${prompt}
  11100: So ${name-player}, you heard everything, did you...${prompt}
  11101: I was hoping to seek out new challenges and take my idol career to the next level.${prompt}
  11102: You see, I wanted to form a dance duo with a Goblin girl so that we could display our talents on a worldwide stage.${prompt}
  11103: Uka felt that the image of the Mighty Maidens would suffer as a result, but I'm more worried about my act growing stale.${prompt}
  11104: I mean, I know I'm wildly popular with my fans and audiences everywhere, but I'm constantly doing the same show over and over again!${prompt}
  11105: |-
    They're waiting with bated breath for me to come out with a great new costume and even more songs and dance routines!
    You know, something real spectacular!${prompt}
  11106: It was then that things took a sudden turn...${prompt}
  11107: I heard the Goblins were planning some kind of festival.${prompt}
  11108: |-
    When you think of festivals, what comes to mind? That's right! The performances!
    And what better performance is there than the Heroine Stage Show?${prompt}
  11109: |-
    Somehow, the Goblins felt that my show lacked the proper punch.
    However, I know my fans would've given me the strength to put on a powerful performance.${prompt}
  11110: |-
    So I started thinking up some new poses and catchphrases.
    I worked really hard on them too...${prompt}
  11111: |-
    Even so, that Maat guy kept complaining about me though.
    He basically told me I was a failure as an idol!${prompt}
  11112: It caused me to lose some of my usual superstar swagger.${prompt}
  11113: Hah! C-could this be the work of the evil Ullegore!?${prompt}
  11114: |-
    ...
    No, it can't be. I didn't even hear any narration.${prompt}
  11115: Ah, there you are, Mumor. I come bearing news.${prompt}
  11116: Huh!?
  11117: |-
    This isn't good!
    This isn't good at all, kupo!${prompt}
  11118: What's wrong, Diva...err, I mean Kupolietta!?${prompt}
  11119: I was told that we might not be able to perform at the Festival of Brave Souls, kupo!${prompt}
  11120: |-
    Wait, what!?
    Why not!?${prompt}
  11121: |-
    It's all because of that rumor...
    That terrible rumor, kupo.${prompt}
  11122: They say an ominous shadow wanders to the east of Batallia Downs each and every night...
  11123: Apparently, everyone who sees it says the same thing, kupo...
  11124: “I saw something that nobody should ever have to see...”
  11125: They then leave Jeuno, never to return again...
  11126: |-
    Th-this is terrible news!
    Isn't the Festival of Brave Souls also held east of Batallia Downs!?${prompt}
  11127: |-
    Indeed it is, kupo.
    The cave there is the very heart of the festivities.${prompt}
  11128: Yet, as long as that shadow roams about, there's no way they can have the festival, kupo.${prompt}
  11129: Hah! C-could this be the work of the evil Ullegore!?${prompt}
  11130: |-
    ...
    No, it can't be. I didn't even hear any narration.${prompt}
  11131: And so, the brave Mumor found that she must rise up to strike down this shadowy threat!${prompt}
  11132: |-
    Yes, that's right!
    I must take my destiny into my own hands!${prompt}
  11133: |-
    Although, as it stands, I'm just a lone idol.
    I'll never be able to muster the necessary strength for this task.${prompt}
  11134: |-
    So that's where you come in.
    This is your chance to join me as a Mighty Maiden!${prompt}
  11135: |-
    I mean, you're an adventurer, right?
    Come on, together, we'll form an unstoppable duo!${prompt}
  11136: |-
    Form a duo with Mumor?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure, why not.
    I think I'll pass.
    I'm not really a maiden...${prompt}
  11137: |-
    Thank you so much!
    It's settled then! We'll be known as the Dashing Damsels!${prompt}
  11138: |-
    What's that?
    Speak up, I can't hear you.${prompt}
  11139: |-
    Hooray!
    We're going to be the best duo ever!${prompt}
  11140: Come on--deep down, everyone has something of a girlish side.${prompt}
  11141: From today forth, we shall be known as the Delightful Damsels!${prompt}
  11142: There's nothing like the sweet feelings of love that come from a warm and caring heart.${prompt}
  11143: |-
    We'll show that sinister shadow what for!
    Come, we march for Batallia Downs at once!${prompt}
  11144: Hm? You're wondering if I know aboutaru the mysterious shadow that wanders Batallia Downs after dark?${prompt}
  11145: |-
    Of course I do!
    You'd be smartaru to stay away from the cave in eastern Batallia Downs--the one within view of the ocean.${prompt}
  11146: But, if you think you have what it takes to stand againstaru this shadow, I won't try to stop you.${prompt}
  11147: Are ya here 'bout the Festival of Brave Souls too?${prompt}
  11148: |-
    Oh well, I guess it can't be helped.
    The most important site for the festival is a cave east of Batallia Downs.${prompt}
  11149: |-
    Five thousand years ago, many brave warriors lost their lives.
    That location is currently servin' as their burial mound.${prompt}
  11150: |-
    But there's a mysterious shadow prowlin' their eternal resting place.
    Unfortunately, it's keepin' us from going anywhere near it.${prompt}
  11151: |-
    Unbelievable!
    Why am I just hearing about this now!?${prompt}
  11152: I understand your frustration, but this story was written for us by a famous Goblin author.${prompt}
  11153: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}!
    I'm glad you're here!${prompt}
  11154: You know my show that was scheduled for the Festival of Brave Souls?${prompt}
  11155: Get this, they're calling it the “Mighty Maiden Fantastox Heroine Stage Show”!${prompt}
  11156: |-
    First of all, who is this Fantastox person!?
    My name is Mumor!${prompt}
  11157: |-
    Fantastox's a famous Goblin thief.
    Her specialties include Sneak Attacks and Trick Attacks.${prompt}
  11158: So I'm supposed to team up with this thief against the enemy, right!?${prompt}
  11159: Actually, we need ya to play the evil villain that's tryin' to steal Mighty Maiden Fantastox's mask.${prompt}
  11160: |-
    Why would I want to steal some girl's mask?
    That's a bit weird, don't you think?${prompt}
  11161: In the story, it's a special mask that's got the power to turn boulders into bombs.${prompt}
  11162: |-
    And what am I supposed to do with something like that!?
    Although, I guess a show is always better if it has explosions in it...${prompt}
  11163: |-
    I know, right?
    We're gonna use smoke to simulate the explosion and set the stage.${prompt}
  11164: |-
    I get it!
    So that's when I appear as Mighty Maiden Mumor and sing my new song!?${prompt}
  11165: |-
    Exactly! Due to your actions, the world finds itself on the brink of destruction...
    But that's when Fantastox rises up to resume the fight!${prompt}
  11166: |-
    Wait, what!?
    You're totally making me out to be the villain here!${prompt}
  11167: |-
    Yeah, that's the point.
    I've been tellin' ya that from the very beginning.${prompt}
  11168: |-
    Hey, it's ${name-player}!
    What are you doing here!?${prompt}
  11169: Ah! It's the brave hero, Gloom Phantom!${prompt}
  11170: Brave hero...?${prompt}
  11171: I came as soon as I received your message!${prompt}
  11172: So the “World Eater Egg” was found right in the middle of Jeuno!${prompt}
  11173: |-
    That's right.
    Before anyone realized it was the “World Eater Egg,” it went from being in a Goblin's capable hands to someone eating it...${prompt}
  11174: Wha!? The shell was cracked open without needing my sword!?${prompt}
  11175: |-
    Yeah, it's a total mystery.
    It's also unclear where this “World Eater Egg” originally came from.${prompt}
  11176: The World Eater...Egg...?${prompt}
  11177: Ultimately, it was that girl there who gave the egg to the man known as Maat, who then promptly ate it.${prompt}
  11178: |-
    W-well, I, uh...
    He told me he was hungry, and so I simply brought him ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} I found nearby...${prompt}
  11179: What I want to know is where was the egg before that?${prompt}
  11180: I don't know the details, but I heard a monster near Delkfutt's Tower was carryin' it.${prompt}
  11181: |-
    Delkfutt?
    Where have I heard that name before...${prompt}
  11182: |-
    Delkfutt's Tower is on Qufim Island, which is in Gigas territory.
    Clearly, certain death awaits us there.${prompt}
  11183: Can I ask for your help in this matter, brave hero?${prompt}
  11184: |-
    That's why I'm here!
    Leave everything to us!${prompt}
  11185: Hmm... Maybe one of the Gigas knows about the egg and the monster that had it...${prompt}
  11186: |-
    I got it!
    We'll go to Qufim Island and capture one of the Gigas there and question it!${prompt}
  11187: You can help us too, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  11188: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure, count me in!
    Sorry, I'm busy.${prompt}
  11189: Naturally, Dazbog and Magh Bihu'll be going to Qufim Island as well!${prompt}
  11190: Where's your sense of adventure!?${prompt}
  11191: Dazbog and Magh Bihu'll be going to Qufim Island too, so there's no need to be afraid!${prompt}
  11192: Okay, we'll be waiting for you in front of Delkfutt's Tower!${prompt}
  11193: |-
    It's rare that you meet such a mighty hero in person.
    There aren't many who can draw others to their cause so effortlessly.${prompt}
  11194: |-
    As for you...
    I believe people called ya "that horror from the holdfast" before, yes?${prompt}
  11195: So clearly, that makes ya the perfect villain for our story.${prompt}
  11196: |-
    I resent that remark!
    You obviously don't know what's important in a Heroine Stage Show!${prompt}
  11197: Wh-what did you say!?${prompt}
  11198: If you don't know how a show is supposed to resonate with its fans, then I guess I'll just have to teach you!${prompt}
  11199: Phew! That was intense.${prompt}
  11200: She said she's goin' back home to grab an old script or somethin' like that.${prompt}
  11201: I think I'd better take this chance to get as far away from here as possible...${prompt}
  11202: |-
    As for you, you need to go help Gloom Phantom at Delkfutt's Tower on Qufim Island.
    Got it?${prompt}
  11203: So anyway, that Gigas known as Echion knew some things, but not others.${prompt}
  11204: |-
    I see...
    Although, we still don't know how the “World Eater Egg” was cracked open without using your sword.${prompt}
  11205: Indeed. Not even the undead themselves should be able to break it open.${prompt}
  11206: However, they do seem to have the ability to find the “World Eater Egg.”${prompt}
  11207: |-
    Still, I'm amazed by the Gigas's stupidity.
    This all happened because they found the “World Eater Egg” and just let it be.${prompt}
  11208: They just ignore whatever we have to say!${prompt}
  11209: Furthermore, they have no idea just how terrifying Chaos truly is!${prompt}
  11210: Five thousand years ago, the one known as Chaos sought to destroy all that was new, even the world itself...${prompt}
  11211: |-
    That included Goblins, Yagudo, Orcs, Quadav...
    Anything that was different from itself.
  11212: A great number of species went extinct before the strongest of those that remained banded together.
  11213: The Gigas feel that way because during the battle against Chaos five thousand years ago, they hadn't even been born yet.${prompt}
  11214: So there's no way they could've known about the hatred from those that were devoured by Chaos.${prompt}
  11215: Well, I don't like how they don't believe us just because they haven't seen something themselves.${prompt}
  11216: By the way, about that undead who was carrying the World Eater Egg...${prompt}
  11217: Is the mage known as Garazu-Horeizu that can control the undead involved somehow?${prompt}
  11218: Actually, we don't really know the answer to that ourselves.${prompt}
  11219: Well, someone must know something!${prompt}
  11220: M-maybe this one here knows s-something?${prompt}
  11221: |-
    How about Garazu-Horeizu and Chaos?
    ${selection-lines}
    The book on maelstrom theory...?
    The Fourth Yagudo War...?
    Sorry, I forgot.${prompt}
  11222: |-
    What do you mean you forgot!?
    I'm gonna yank your petals out myself!${prompt}
  11223: |-
    How about Garazu-Horeizu and Chaos?
    ${selection-lines}
    Like the maelstrom theory?
    How about the Yagudo War?
    Was it the “new discoveries”?${prompt}
  11224: Hmm... I'm not sure if that makes it any clearer or not.${prompt}
  11225: |-
    I think I got a pretty good idea.
    We can have Dazbog explain the rest later.${prompt}
  11226: Th-that's fine, but we still haven't solved the m-mystery yet...${prompt}
  11227: We haven't!?${prompt}
  11228: C-clearly, Garazu-Horeizu wanted info on Chaos in order to l-learn a new kind of magic.${prompt}
  11229: H-he looked into Chaos even after his death and journey to V-Valhalla...${prompt}
  11230: B-but Chaos was defeated in Valhalla...${prompt}
  11231: |-
    Yeah, that's right!
    Odin dealt the finishing blow personally!${prompt}
  11232: Wait, I thought it was a brave Goblin hero that delivered that blow five thousand years ago?${prompt}
  11233: Huh? In the battle for the Middle Lands, it was my ancestor who dealt the finishing blow.${prompt}
  11234: However, Chaos was no ordinary opponent.${prompt}
  11235: Chaos was resurrected in a world beyond this one...${prompt}
  11236: So my ancestor and numerous other brave warriors journeyed to Valhalla and continued the fight, even beyond death.${prompt}
  11237: Ah, so those are the warriors whose death we mourn as part of the Festival of Brave Souls.${prompt}
  11238: So at the very end, Odin dealt the final blow.${prompt}
  11239: Hmm... So clearly, Chaos met its end long, long ago.${prompt}
  11240: |-
    That's a relief.
    I was worried about what I'd do if Chaos was still alive today.${prompt}
  11241: |-
    It's not just me, either. All Goblins carry this sense of dread.
    That's why we started the Festival of Brave Souls.${prompt}
  11242: I wholeheartedly support this festival as well!${prompt}
  11243: |-
    I've got it!
    We can call it the “Mighty Maidens Heroine Stage Show: Remember the Battle against Chaos”!${prompt}
  11244: Say that again?${prompt}
  11245: It's a show we can put on at the Festival of Brave Souls!${prompt}
  11246: 'Or, we can simplify the name a bit and just call it the “Mighty Maidens Heroine Stage Show: Defeat Chaos”!${prompt}'
  11247: What is she talking about!?${prompt}
  11248: She's not happy with the show for the festival, so she's been trying to convince me to change it.${prompt}
  11249: |-
    You're right...
    She's been here the whole time.${prompt}
  11250: It came to me after hearing all of you talk!${prompt}
  11251: This evil being known as Chaos tried to eradicate anyone who was different from it, so various beings worked together to oppose it, right?${prompt}
  11252: |-
    And afterwards, this enemy rose up once again to put the land in danger!
    This story has it all--a real tearjerker followed by everyone living happily ever after!${prompt}
  11253: A story like that contains everything that fans want to see in a Heroine Stage Show!${prompt}
  11254: 'First: everyone is made stronger due to their differences!${prompt}'
  11255: 'Second: they overcome their differences and work together!${prompt}'
  11256: 'Third: there are moments of sadness, but people rise up in a spirit of hope!${prompt}'
  11257: Hmm... When you put it like that...${prompt}
  11258: Furthermore, once everyone sees the show, they won't be like the Gigas and not believe in something because they've never seen it before!${prompt}
  11259: Yes, I suppose you have a point...${prompt}
  11260: Okay! I'll give it some thought!${prompt}
  11261: You will!?${prompt}
  11262: However, in regards to Valhalla...${prompt}
  11263: Chaos may have hidden the egg before its death.${prompt}
  11264: |-
    Yes, that's totally possible!
    However, I think Odin would've noticed...${prompt}
  11265: Maybe his nose was stuffed up, or he had something else on his mind at the time.${prompt}
  11266: |-
    I-it's definitely a mystery...
    I wish I could ask Odin p-personally.${prompt}
  11267: Wha!? You realize that means you'd have to be dead, right!?${prompt}
  11268: Of course I don't want to die, but I don't want to go back to Hazhalm either!${prompt}
  11269: I-in that case, we could always ask one of Odin's demons...${prompt}
  11270: Oh! You're right! That's a great idea!${prompt}
  11271: Is there one that we can easily talk to?${prompt}
  11272: |-
    There are a few like that here in Jeuno.
    They're disguised as regular people.${prompt}
  11273: Okay then! Let's get going!${prompt}
  11274: After hearing that girl's excitement, I've decided to give her proposal some serious thought.${prompt}
  11275: With a show based on the battle against Chaos, we can reach people that might not know anything about it.${prompt}
  11276: |-
    The problem is what role can I have her play...
    Hmm... What if she played Chaos...?${prompt}
