    Tenez, prenez cette clé. Elle ouvre la porte qui mène aux parties les plus profondes du temple.
    Amusez-vous bien ! Hah-hah-hah !${prompt}
  9971: Vous ne savez pas comment aller au temple ? Il est juste au sud-est d'ici. Mais c'est toute l'aide que je peux vous apporter. Je ne risquerai pas ma queue, ni celle de mes gardes.${prompt}
  9972: Non, non, non. Je ne peux pas vous laisser passer ici. Personnel autorisé seulement.${prompt}
  9973: Nous pouvons livrer des colis aux Maisons Mog partout à Vana'diel.${prompt}
  9974: Vous allez dans la Jungle de Yuhtunga ? Sur le côté est, il y a un volcan. À l'intérieur de ce volcan se trouve le Chaudron d'Ifrit. Je ne recommanderais pas de visites touristiques. Ces endroits sont plutôt désagréables.${prompt}
  9975: De plus, sur le côté sud-est le plus éloigné de cette île se trouve un ancien temple en ruine. Peu de gens vivent pour le voir, cependant. Les jungles ici regorgent de bêtes féroces...${prompt}
  9976: Alors, de quoi parle-t-on avec cette nouvelle Grande Guerre sur les continents ?${prompt}
  9977: Vous verrez. Quand les flammes de la bataille commenceront à faire rage, ce seront les Mithra qui sauveront tout le monde.${prompt}
  9978: De nos jours, beaucoup de jeunes quittent Kazham pour les villes du continent...${prompt}
  9979: Cela va bien... tant qu'ils réalisent que dès qu'ils franchissent les portes de la ville, ils ne seront plus les bienvenus ici.${prompt}
  9980: Si vous marchez assez loin vers le sud-est, vous arriverez à un ensemble de ruines connu sous le nom de Temple d'Uggalepih.${prompt}
  9981: Beaucoup de voyageurs insouciants s'y rendent pour voir les curiosités, mais tous ne reviennent pas en un seul morceau...${prompt}
  9982: Il y a quelque temps, on parlait d'envoyer une équipe au Temple d'Uggalepih pour combattre les Tonberries. Vous savez, cet endroit est leur forteresse.${prompt}
  9983: Cependant, la cheftaine n'a pas voulu leur prêter sa clé du temple, et c'est là que tout s'est arrêté.${prompt}
  9984: Vous ne me trouverez pas en train de me diriger vers de nouvelles terres ou de me prosterner devant une nouvelle cheftaine.${prompt}
  9985: À quoi bon une cheftaine qui ne se bat pas ? Les Mithra ne devraient suivre qu'un leader qui ne recule pas devant un combat.${prompt}
  9986: Ce comptoir est réservé aux départs. Le comptoir des arrivées est de l'autre côté.${prompt}

  10001: Nous espérons que vos rêves grandiront sous notre soleil éclatant.${prompt}
  10002: Êtes-vous déjà allé à Windurst ? Une tribu de Mithra qui a quitté Kazham il y a longtemps vit là-bas.${prompt}
  10003: Tous les agressifs sont partis, tandis que la plupart des détendus sont restés. C'est pourquoi Kazham est si paisible.${prompt}

  10007: Qu'en est-il de ce volcan à l'est d'ici ? Je parie que tu n'y es pas encore allé, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10008: Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas, jeune aventurier ? On dirait que tu as quelque chose en tête.${prompt}
  10009: Chaque fois que quelque chose me trouble, je m'assieds et me détends au soleil de Kazham, et tout va bien.${prompt}

  10014: Maintenant que les routes vers les Terres Extérieures ont été ouvertes, des hordes d'aventuriers ont afflué à Kazham.${prompt}
  10015: Nous pensions que nous, chercheurs de la Rhynostère, pourrions aider ceux qui découvrent Elshimo pour la première fois.${prompt}
  10016: Il semble que Perih Vashai, Maître de l'Arc Azur, soit devenue cheftaine de la tribu à Windurst.${prompt}
  10017: J'ai entendu dire qu'elle a obtenu ce poste pour avoir capturé des pécheurs qui s'étaient échappés de Kazham pendant la Grande Guerre.${prompt}
  10018: Vous avez entendu parler des Tonberries, n'est-ce pas ? Ils peuvent sembler petits, mais ils frappent fort... et ils reviennent toujours en vouloir plus, peu importe combien vous en éliminez !${prompt}
  10019: Quand vous êtes à l'extérieur des portes de la ville, surveillez vos arrières... ces gars vous planteront un couteau dedans !${prompt}
  10020: Nous, les Mithra, sommes liées à cette terre. Nous écoutons ses cris, la protégeons, et la respectons.${prompt}
  10021: Quand un groupe change d'endroit, les vies de ce groupe changent avec, mais les liens avec la terre restent intacts.${prompt}
  10022: Vous êtes un aventurier, hein ? Pourquoi ne pas essayer votre chance dans le Chaudron d'Ifrit ?${prompt}
  10023: Vous ne pouvez pas dire que vous avez visité Yuhtunga sans avoir vu le volcan !${prompt}
  10024: Wow ! Vous êtes arrivé ici par dirigeable ? Pas mal pour un aventurier !${prompt}
  10025: Un jour, j'aimerais voyager à travers Vana'diel sur l'un de ces navires volants. Grâce à la cheftaine, c'est plus facile de voyager en dehors de Kazham ces jours-ci.${prompt}
  10026: Hé, vous ! Avez-vous apporté quelque chose d'intéressant du continent ?${prompt}
  10027: Rien ? Quel genre d'aventurier êtes-vous ? L'autre jour, un Hume de Bastok nous a montré la chose la plus cool ! Après ça, il était le gars le plus populaire en ville !${prompt}
  10028: Chaque fois que j'entends le son de l'océan, je pense que ça ressemble à quelqu'un qui appelle "dors～, dors～." Vous l'entendez aussi, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/dame] ? ${prompt}

  10031: La jungle juste à l'extérieur des portes du village est la Jungle de Yuhtunga. Au sud de la Jungle de Yuhtunga se trouve la Jungle de Yhoator. Vous avez bien compris ?${prompt}
  10032: Ce n'est qu'une rumeur, mais j'ai entendu que la cheftaine avait le béguin pour un vieux gars Hume.${prompt}
  10033: Je ne vois pas pourquoi une Mithra s'intéresserait à un gars Hume. Qu'est-ce qu'il y a de bien chez quelqu'un qui ne peut même pas sentir sa proie ?${prompt}
  10034: En ce qui concerne le lancer de couteau, il n'y a personne qui puisse égaler le talent de notre cheftaine. Je vous conseille de rester dans ses bonnes grâces.${prompt}
  10035: Rien dans ce monde n'est créé bon ou mauvais. Cependant, le mal peut surgir quand quelque chose se trouve dans un endroit où il ne devrait pas être.${prompt}
  10036: Pour ramener ces choses là où elles appartiennent, nous devons souvent recevoir l'aide de la nature. Cela est vrai aussi pour guérir les maladies et soigner les blessures.${prompt}
  10037: Les choses destinées à vivre vivront. Celles destinées à mourir mourront quand leur heure sera venue. Cependant, cela ne signifie pas que vous devriez cesser de lutter pour la vie.${prompt}
  10038: Kazham est protégée par le gardien du volcan situé à l'est d'ici. Avec son rire et sa colère, le gardien fait trembler la terre et nous donne la force de survivre.${prompt}
  10039: Pour lui montrer notre gratitude chaque jour, nous lui offrons nos meilleures récoltes. C'est ainsi depuis des centaines d'années.${prompt}
  10040: On dirait que vous ne faites pas grand-chose d'autre que de gêner. Pourquoi ne pas faire un voyage au volcan et montrer votre visage à notre gardien ?${prompt}

  10060: Non, n'est-ce pas ? Tout ce que vous voulez est ici !${prompt}
  10061: Quand vous mourrez, vous ne pouvez rien emporter avec vous, mais à quoi bon la vie si vous n'avez rien pour en profiter ?${prompt}
  10062: Parfois, un étrange Hume vient du sud pour acheter des choses. Je me demande ce qu'il fait là-bas...${prompt}
  10063: Vous ne voulez pas vous faire fouetter par ces Tonberries, n'est-ce pas ? Eh bien, j'ai exactement l'équipement qu'il vous faut !${prompt}
  10064: Armures solides, armes puissantes, nourriture, fournitures... c'est difficile de se procurer tout cela avant de partir à l'aventure.${prompt}
  10065: Je veux vraiment participer au Pèlerinage des Flammes de la Cheftaine Jakoh Wahcondalo. Toutefois, sans l'équipement approprié, je ne pense pas pouvoir atteindre le sommet du Chaudron d'Ifrit.${prompt}
  10066: Quand nous, les Mithra, établissons un nouveau village, nous invoquons le pouvoir du gardien de cette terre et fabriquons un arc spécial.${prompt}
  10067: Cet arc est gardé par la cheftaine en tant que symbole du lien entre nous et la terre que nous avons choisie. L'Arc de Thalassa que porte Jakoh Wahcondalo est le lien de Kazham avec Elshimo.${prompt}
  10068: Ah, j'aime comment mes lames brillent quand elles sont maniées sous la lumière de la lune.${prompt}
  10069: Et pas seulement brillent... mes poignards coupent si bien que même la cheftaine m'en a demandé... non, deux !${prompt}

  10097: “Elle a dit qu'elle était tombée sur une salle qui ressemblait à une galerie d'art. Les murs étaient couverts de nombreux cadres, mais dans ces cadres, il n'y avait pas de peintures.${prompt}

  10128: Oh, et prenez ça. Cela pourrait avoir été un travail inutile, mais le travail est le travail.${prompt}
  10129: Beaucoup de gens disent qu'ils entendent des voix quand ils voyagent autour du Temple d'Uggalepih.${prompt}

  10347: Pourriez-vous reculer ? Je ne peux pas supporter cette odeur épouvantable à mon âge... Ça me rend étourdi(e) !${prompt}
  10348: Alors encore un autre mainlander est allé fourrer ${choice-player-gender}[son/sa] nez là où il ne devait pas... Quand apprendrez-vous ?${prompt}
  10349: Allez chez M & P's. Je crois me souvenir qu'ils parlaient d'une méthode ancienne pour éliminer cette odeur. Pas que ça va fonctionner...${prompt}
  10350: Hé là, aventurier ! Avez-vous eu votre dose de Kazham ?${prompt}
  10351: Si c'est le cas, partez déjà. Vous empestez !${prompt}
  10352: Je vais vous donner deux choix, et ensuite je vais compter jusqu'à dix.${prompt}
  10353: Vous pouvez faire vos bagages et quitter Kazham maintenant... ou trouver un moyen de vous débarrasser de cette puanteur !${prompt}
  10354: Je n'imagine pas traverser la vie en sentant comme les excréments d'un Opo-opo... Oh, vous m'avez entendu ?${prompt}
  10355: Vous avez entendu parler des Tonberries, n'est-ce pas ? Ils peuvent sembler petits, mais ils frappent fort... et ils reviennent toujours en vouloir plus, peu importe combien vous en éliminez !${prompt}
  10356: Mais on dirait... je veux dire, ça sent comme si je devais d'abord vous avoir prévenu à propos de la Rafflesia !${prompt}
  10357: Beurk ! Vous n'avez pas lu l'avis à la sortie des arrivées de l'aéronef ?${prompt}
  10358: Si Kazham attrape encore plus d'aventuriers comme vous, nous devrons tous retourner dans la jungle !${prompt}
  10359: Quand avez-vous pris votre dernier bain, aventurier ? Hein ?${prompt}
  10360: Je ne vous dis cela que parce que je vous aime bien--vous devriez vraiment prendre le prochain aéronef et ne plus jamais montrer votre visage dans ce village.${prompt}
  10361: Je ne veux pas être impoli, mais vous sentez pire que mes Gaiters de Mithra.${prompt}
  10362: Beurk ! Vous ne portez pas des œufs de lézard pourris dans votre sac, n'est-ce pas ? Ça pue vraiment !${prompt}
  10363: D'accord, d'accord ! Je suis réveillé. Je ne pensais pas que quelque chose pourrait me réveiller, mais cette odeur a fait le trrravail.${prompt}
  10364: Comment vous, les gens du continent, diriez-vous cela ?${prompt}
  10365: “Pardonnez mon impertinence, mais il semble que vous ayez une odeur plutôt unique sur vous aujourd'hui...” Est-ce proche ?${prompt}
  10366: En ce qui concerne le lancer de couteau, il n'y a personne qui puisse égaler le talent de notre cheftaine. Et avec une odeur comme celle-là, elle pourrait probablement vous toucher les yeux fermés.${prompt}
  10367: Si vous allez vous aventurer dans la jungle, vous devriez être préparé pour des bêtes hideuses et des odeurs hideuses.${prompt}
  10368: Peut-être que je devrais acheter un masque à gaz pour mon prochain voyage...${prompt}
  10369: Quittez mon atelier. Je ne peux pas me concentrer avec cette puanteur dans ma maison.${prompt}
  10370: Ah, j'aime comment mes lames brillent quand elles sont maniées sous la lumière de la lune.${prompt}
  10371: Mais si vous ne sortez pas votre queue puante de mon champ de vision, je ne vais pas attendre que la lune soit levée pour vous montrer à quel point elles sont tranchantes.${prompt}
  10372: Hé ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/dame]...${prompt}
  10373: Est-ce que tout le monde sur le continent sent aussi mauvais que vous ?${prompt}
  10374: Beaucoup de gens du continent craignent notre médecine traditionnelle.${prompt}
  10375: Je peux comprendre que les gens aient peur des choses qu'ils connaissent peu, mais c'est dommage que beaucoup rejettent des méthodes avant même de les essayer.${prompt}
  10376: <Tousse> Il semble que vous ayez passé trop de temps autour de l'un des résidents les plus notoires de notre jungle... la Rafflesia.${prompt}
  10377: Hmmm... Beaucoup de temps s'est écoulé depuis que vous êtes entré en contact avec la fleur, mais je pense qu'il y a encore de l'espoir pour éliminer cette odeur.${prompt}
  10378: |-
    Ah, mais attendez...
    Les sources du Serpent dans la Grotte du Serpent de Mer se sont asséchées il y a trois ans.${prompt}
  10379: Ce n'est pas bon. Il n'y a qu'une seule façon de se débarrasser de cette odeur, et c'est de prendre un bain dans une source chaude. Cependant, ce ne peut pas être n'importe quelle source chaude. Elle doit être située profondément sous la mer.${prompt}
  10380: Je me demande s'il existe d'autres sources chaudes comme celle-ci dans les différentes régions de Vana'diel...${prompt}
  10381: En prenant un bain dans l'une de ces sources, l'odeur devrait disparaître... sauf si nous sommes déjà trop en retard.${prompt}
  10382: Vous devez trouver une source chaude, mais uniquement une située quelque part profondément sous la mer.${prompt}
  10383: Prenez un bain là-dedans, et l'odeur devrait disparaître... sauf si nous sommes déjà trop en retard.${prompt}
  10384: Félicitations. Je vois que vous avez réussi à localiser une autre source chaude. Vous sentez un peu la sueur, mais c'est rien qu'une bonne douche ne pourra pas guérir.${prompt}
  10385: Cela signifie que vous pouvez maintenant rester en sécurité à Kazham. Prenez ceci. Vous l'avez bien mérité.${prompt}
  10386: Cependant, ne supposez pas que je vous aiderai à nouveau si vous vous retrouvez dans la même situation.${prompt}
  10387: Félicitations ! Maintenant, vous pouvez rester à Kazham sans attirer l'attention de tout le monde.${prompt}
  10388: Mais ne supposez pas que je vous aiderai à nouveau si vous vous retrouvez dans la même situation.${prompt}
  10389: Vous, les gens du continent, n'apprendrez donc jamais ?${prompt}
  10390: Je vous l'ai dit la dernière fois, je ne vous aiderai plus. Vous devrez simplement essayer de vous rappeler ce que je vous ai enseigné avant.${prompt}

    Bonjour ?
    Vous êtes un aventurier, n'est-ce pas ?
    Peut-être pouvez-vous nous aider.${prompt}
  10559: Permettez-moi de me présenter ainsi que mon compagnon. Nous venons de la Rhynostère à Windurst.${prompt}
  10560: 'J''ai été embauché par le ministère pour accompagner ce chercheur à ${choice: 2}[le Chaudron d''Ifrit/les Cavernes des Sables Mouvants/l''Antre de la Rancœur/la Pointe de Teriggan/Fei''Yin/l''Arbre de Boyahda] et l''assister dans son étude d''une série de cristaux géants.${prompt}'

  10562: |-
    Nous avons essayé d'innombrables fois, mais je n'ai pas pu vaincre cette bête.
    Un autre chercheur à la Rhynostère a sympathisé avec notre situation et a développé une fourche de réglage améliorée.${prompt}
  10563: |-
    Non non non non non !
    Ce gadget fou ne nous fournira aucune donnée utile !${prompt}

    Écoutez, cerveau de muscles.
    La science n'est pas une question de gagner ou de perdre, de vie ou de mort, de pair ou d'impair ! C'est une matière plus délicate !${prompt}
  10565: Vous voyez ce que j'ai à gérer ? Je ne sais pas combien de temps je peux encore travailler avec un tel pessimiste.${prompt}
  10566: |-
    C'est là que vous intervenez.
    Je pensais laisser un de vous aventuriers tester la nouvelle fourche et prouver à mon collègue qu'elle peut fournir des données précieuses pour sa recherche.${prompt}
  10567: |-
    Non non non non non !
    Même s'ils utilisent cette fourchette de seconde zone, il faudra un invocateur hors pair pour vaincre l'avatar primaire !${prompt}
  10568: |-
    Écoutez bien.
    Le ${item-singular: 1[2]} sophistiqué ne vous facilitera pas la tâche pour vaincre le monstre à l'intérieur du cristal. Certes, il réduira la puissance de l'avatar primaire à environ ${number: 3}, mais il en fera de même pour vous ! Et en plus, vous ne pourrez invoquer que ce petit insecte bleu, Carbuncle !${prompt}
  10569: Et pour aggraver les choses, personne d'autre ne pourra entrer dans le cristal avec vous ! Vous serez en combat un contre un, homme contre homme, Taru contre Taru !${prompt}

    Oui, mais monsieur... La Rhynostère nous presse de produire des résultats. Si nous n'agissons pas rapidement...${prompt}

    Je suppose qu'un affrontement avec un avatar primaire ne ferait pas de mal.${prompt}

    Eh bien, vous l'avez voulu !
    Prenez ce ${item-singular: 1[2]} et faites-le sonner près de l'un de ces cristaux géants. L'avatar primaire ne sera pas content d'être réveillé, et vous devrez affronter sa colère.${prompt}

    Iru-Kuiru de la Rhinostery a engagé Yow Rabntah comme aventurière, et la tragédie qui a suivi a creusé un fossé entre nous et les Mithra de Kazham...${prompt}

    J'ai le même genre de problèmes quand il s'agit de Romaa.
    J'ai eu un accrochage avec sa fille, Nanaa Mihgo.${prompt}
  10701: |-
    Mais Romaa a reconnu ma force lorsqu'il s'agissait de choisir une nouvelle cheftaine.
    Elle ne laisse pas ses émotions interférer avec les questions importantes.${prompt}

    Soyez honnêtes dans votre approche et elle vous dira ce que vous avez besoin de savoir.

    Merci pour vos conseils.

    Kazham n'a pas été tendre avec les étrangers.

    Ancienne Cheftaine Romaa Mihgo.
    Je suis Ildy-Goldy, un aventurier de la Rhinostery.
    Voici ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10708: Nous cherchons un Traqueur Mithra qui a visité Windurst.${prompt}
  10709: |-
    Ce Traqueur Mithra s'est rendu dans les Terres du Nord avec une fourche d'accord de la Rhinostery.
    Elle n'est pas revenue.${prompt}
  10710: Ce nouveau modèle de fourche d'accord a été conçu pour résonner avec les protocristaux des grands êtres.${prompt}
  10711: |-
    Cependant, cette fourche est bien plus puissante que les modèles précédents.
    Sa fiabilité n'a pas été testée et, franchement, nous sommes assez inquiets.${prompt}
  10712: Nous suspectons que le chasseur de péchés n'a pas pu quitter le cristal de ténèbres...${prompt}
  10713: Votre inquiétude est mal placée.${prompt}
  10714: Que des Tarutaru s'inquiètent pour elle serait une insulte pire que la mort pour un traqueur.${prompt}
  10715: Bien que ce soit vrai que les sens d'un traqueur sont émoussés dans les Terres du Nord, elle n'est pas un chaton pour se perdre dans la neige.${prompt}
  10716: Mais si elle ne revient jamais, cette situation va se transformer en un crime auquel la Rhinostery devra répondre, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10717: L'expédition alliée est un exemple évident.${prompt}
  10718: La Rhinostery est encore hantée par la tragédie qui est arrivée à Yow Rabntah après avoir été employée par Iru-Kuiru.${prompt}
  10719: Vous avez expulsé tous nos chercheurs de votre ville et fermé les portes de Kazham.${prompt}

  10723: Peut-être que notre paix renouvelée n'est pas ce que vous souhaitez...${prompt}
  10724: Il y a des moments où le conflit est nécessaire...${prompt}

  10747: Hourra ! Vous l'avez fait, ${name-player} !${prompt} 
  10748: |-
    Au travail...
    Vous vouliez savoir où trouver Shikaree Y ?${prompt}
  10749: Oui.${prompt}
  10750: Tout comme un grand cristal de feu est caché dans la Jungle de Yuhtunga, un cristal de ténèbres existerait supposément dans les Terres du Nord.${prompt}
  10751: Nous sommes certains que ce protocristal sombre était la destination du chasseur de péchés.${prompt}
  10752: |-
    Vos instincts étaient corrects.
    Selon les légendes, la divinité qui dort dans ce cristal est la plus proche de se réveiller...${prompt}

  10754: Un des dieux endormis--un des grands êtres--s'est réveillé !?${prompt}
  10755: On dit que la divinité a été ramenée au sommeil par la lumière d'une certaine boîte.${prompt}

    Les Traqueurs Mithra vivent pour la chasse, mais ils n'apprécient pas d'être chassés.

  10857: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  10858: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  10859: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  10860: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  10861: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  10862: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  10863: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  10864: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  10865: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  10866: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  10867: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  10868: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  10869: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  10870: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  10871: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10872: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  10873: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  10874: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  10875: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  10876: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  10877: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  10878: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  10879: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  10880: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10881: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  10882: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  10883: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  10884: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  10885: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  10886: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  10887: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  10888: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  10889: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  10890: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  10891: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  10892: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  10893: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  10894: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  10895: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  10896: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  10897: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  10898: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  10899: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  10900: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  10901: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  10902: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  10903: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  10904: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  10905: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  10906: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10907: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  10908: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  10909: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  10910: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  10911: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  10912: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  10913: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  10914: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  10915: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  10916: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  10917: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  10918: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  10919: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  10920: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  10921: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  10922: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  10923: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  10924: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  10925: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  10926: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  10927: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  10928: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  10929: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  10930: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  10931: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  10932: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  10933: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  10934: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  10935: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  10936: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  10937: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  10938: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  10939: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  10940: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?

    Oh, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too!
    What skills does it require? Let's see here...${prompt}
  10956: |-
    Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!
    Ain't synergy grand?${prompt}
  10957: |-
    Wait! No, don't tell me.
    You strike me as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.${prompt}
  10958: |-
    Learn about synergy?
    ${selection-lines}
    Not today.
    Teach me!
    Just give me ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  10959: |-
    A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living.
    Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.${prompt}
  10960: |-
    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  10961: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  10962: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  10963: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  10964: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  10965: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  10966: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  10967: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  10968: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  10969: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  10970: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}
  10971: |-
    An aspiring synergist, I see!
    If you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you've certainly come to the right place.${prompt}
  10972: |-
    I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for ${number: 0} gil.
    A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  10973: '${number: 0} gil, paid in full!${prompt}'
  10974: |-
    As promised, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you!
    How's that for a deal?${prompt}
  10975: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  10976: Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.${prompt}
  10977: Oh, my. It's not often we get to see such splendidly attirrred adventurers here in Kazham.${prompt}
  10978: I see no reason why you shouldn't be the one to receive my letter.${prompt}
  10979: |-
    Well, to be perrrfectly honest, I was going to send it off to the moogles.
    But between the running of Kazham and keeping its surrounds trrrouble-free, it completely escaped my mind.${prompt}
  10980: Now that the letter's in your possession, best you make yourself scarrrce, lest Etteh and her friends catch on.${prompt}
  10981: She and some other kittens have been obsessed with getting their paws on it, you see. The madness in their eyes is downrrright unsettling!${prompt}
  10982: Keep your guard up even after you've returrrned to the mainland, or the Mithra there will pounce on you and make off with the letter quicker than you can say “Happy Eighth Vana'versary”!${prompt}
  10983: |-
    Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo!
    Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?${prompt}

    Do something, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}

    Buy a storage slip.
    No, thank you.${prompt}
  10985: |-
    Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?
    Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt}
  10986: |-
    That's where I come in, kupo.
    I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt}
  10987: 'To make use of my services, first you''ll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt}'
  10988: Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt}
  10989: You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt}
  10990: Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt}
  10991: |-
    Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.
    I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt}
  10992: |-
    Invisible to you, at least.
    It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt}
  10993: When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt}
  10994: |-
    I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.
    Simple as that, kupo!${prompt}
  10995: |-
    What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!
    Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt}
  10996: |-
    Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.
    So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt}
  10997: For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt}
  10998: |-
    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!
    It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt}
  10999: Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt}
  11000: |-
    If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!
    No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
    Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}
  11001: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt}
  11002: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt}
  11003: |-
    And that's all there is to it.

    Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul.
    Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  11114: By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.${prompt}
  11115: 'At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}'
  11116: Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.${prompt}
  11117: That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.${prompt}
  11118: From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11119: But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.${prompt}
  11120: The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}

    Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all.
    As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.${prompt}
