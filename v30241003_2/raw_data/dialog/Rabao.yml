  9983: Je suis Alfesar, un frère de la Cathédrale de San d'Oria. Je suis venu étudier le Désert d'Altepa et ses alentours.${prompt}
  9984: Jusqu'à très récemment, le Tunnel de Korroloka infesté de monstres a été une barrière entre le continent de Quon et l'île de Zepwell. Mais avec le déblaiement de ce tunnel, j'ai pu me rendre ici.${prompt}
  9985: Sur votre chemin vers Rabao, vous avez sûrement vu les ruines d'antan à moitié enfouies dans le sable. J'ai été chargé d'enquêter sur ces ruines.${prompt}
  9986: 'Il y a plusieurs jours, un chercheur que j''ai embauché a ramené ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} gravé d''écrits anciens. Il l''a trouvé dans les vastes Grottes des Sables Mouvants qui se trouvent sous le Désert d''Altepa.${prompt}'
  9987: C'était une découverte majeure. Selon un spécialiste de la littérature ancienne, l'inscription sur la tablette semble être une sorte de sortilège.${prompt}
  9988: Malheureusement, avec une partie importante de la tablette brisée, nous n'avons pas pu déchiffrer le sens complet.${prompt}

  10001: Parfois, on doit abandonner nos marchandises et courir comme des fous quand on est attaqués par des monstres là-bas. Votre vie est la chose la plus précieuse que vous ayez, mon ami.${prompt}
  10002: Certains des plus méchants bestioles là-bas sont ces énormes scorpions. Ils doivent faire plus du double de ma hauteur, et bien sûr, le dard de la queue va vous injecter du poison.${prompt}
  10003: Ces scorpions sont vraiment une plaie, si vous voyez ce que je veux dire. C'est bien si vous êtes les meilleurs amis d'un mage blanc, mais ici, vous trouverez plus de combattants que de guérisseurs. Si vous n'avez pas un bon stock d'antidotes, vous êtes un homme mort.${prompt}

  10017: Après avoir eu tant de mal à faire remonter l'eau pour l'oasis, les pionniers de cet endroit l'ont peuplée de poissons. On ne peut pas discuter d'une telle minutie, hehehe.${prompt}
  10018: "Les Antica, ces hommes-bêtes qui vivent ici, sont couverts de plaques rigides. \nC'est comme s'ils étaient nés avec une armure naturelle.${prompt}"
  10019: |-
    Vous ne pourrez pas les égratigner sans une bonne arme.
    Cela dit, il faut encore que je m'achète une nouvelle épée. Être un guerrier peut être si coûteux...${prompt}
  10020: Il y a un système de cavernes à la limite nord du Désert d'Altepa Ouest appelé le Tunnel de Kuftal. Le Cap Teriggan se trouve à l'autre bout de ces grottes.${prompt}
  10021: Il y a quelques décennies, on pouvait facilement voyager du cap vers l'intérieur du continent de Quon. Cependant, ce chemin a été perdu lorsque la terre elle-même a bougé pendant la Grande Guerre.${prompt}
  10022: |-
    Hé, saviez-vous ?
    Les ruines ensevelies sous le désert dans les Grottes des Sables Mouvants étaient autrefois une construction splendide des Galka.${prompt}
  10023: Bien avant que vous ou moi ne soyons nés, à une époque où les Antica et les Galka se battaient pour dominer la région, ces bâtiments se dressaient à la surface du désert.${prompt}
  10024: |-
    Et maintenant, ils s'effritent sous les sables mouvants...
    Même en tant que Tarutaru, ça me déprime. Le foyer d'une race entière, disparaissant de la lumière du soleil...${prompt}
  10025: |-
    Voyez-vous ces moulins à vent qui tournent au sommet des tours ?
    Ils utilisent la puissance du vent pour faire remonter l'eau des profondeurs de la terre.${prompt}
  10026: "Même pendant les mois secs, Rabao ne manque jamais d'eau. \nMais faire remonter l'eau à la surface a dû être un sacré exploit à l'origine, cependant.${prompt}"
  10027: |-
    Vous devriez montrer votre gratitude aux pionniers de cet endroit.
    Pourquoi, mon cœur est sur le point d'éclater de toute la gratitude que je ressens.
    Merci, merci, merci...!${prompt}
  10028: Depuis des temps immémoriaux, l'île de Zepwell a été considérée comme une terre interdite. Les passages vers cette île depuis le continent, les tunnels de Gustav et Korroloka, ont été inaccessibles.${prompt}
  10029: Mais les aventuriers prêtent rarement attention aux mots comme "interdit", n'est-ce pas ? Vous semblez être de ce genre-là.${prompt}
  10030: Un groupe de personnes partageant les mêmes idées, évitant les autorités de leurs pays, a trouvé son chemin jusqu'à cette île. Ils ont établi leur base ici, utilisant cet oasis comme point de départ.${prompt}
  10031: Voici Rabao, une ville fondée par des aventuriers.${prompt}
  10032: |-
    Salutations, collègue aventurier.
    Je m'appelle Maryoh-Comyujah.
    J'ai bravé le long et ardu voyage depuis le continent pour chercher des trésors dans les Grottes des Sables Mouvants.${prompt}
  10033: |-
    Cela a été un peu plus dur que prévu, cependant.
    Les Grottes des Sables Mouvants sont vastes et très confuses.${prompt}
  10034: En plus de cela, il y a toutes ces bêtes semblables à des fourmis qui grouillent là-dedans. Pas un endroit agréable pour chercher des richesses perdues !${prompt}
  10035: La route vers les trésors cachés est vraiment longue...${prompt}
  10036: |-
    Vous ne le saviez probablement pas, mais cette île est la patrie perdue des Galka...
    Même dans ces sables infinis, la joie de poser le pied sur votre terre natale est une émotion difficile à exprimer.${prompt}
  10037: Voici ! Le panneau sur cet arc proclame l'existence de la maison d'enchères au-delà. Une abondance de nourriture et de provisions au centre du désert ! Que pourrait-on demander de plus dans cette vie ?${prompt}
  10038: Un peu plus au nord d'ici se trouve l'oasis de Rabao. Ce n'est pas grand-chose, mais il y a des marchandises à vendre dans les tentes.${prompt}
  10039: En dehors de Rabao, le désert s'étend à perte de vue. Rabao est le seul endroit pour rassembler des provisions pour votre voyage et sert de point de passage pour les aventuriers. Il est important que nous travaillions ensemble ici.${prompt}
  10040: |-
    Bienvenue, aventurier.
    Voici Rabao, une précieuse oasis au milieu du vaste désert d'Altepa.
    Profitez de l'occasion pour vous revitaliser avant de poursuivre votre voyage.${prompt}
  10041: Lorsque votre sac est prêt à éclater, envoyez vos objets non essentiels à votre boîte de livraison et bam, problème résolu !${prompt}
  10042: Nous pouvons livrer des biens à votre résidence ou à celle de vos amis.${prompt}
  10043: |-
    Bienvenue à Rabao.
    Je m'appelle Cavalgrinne, et je suis en charge des services de la maison d'enchères.${prompt}
  10044: |-
    Il n'y a pas de prix fixes à la maison d'enchères.
    N'oubliez pas de vérifier l'historique des prix lorsque vous enchérissez ou mettez un objet en vente.${prompt}
  10045: |-
    Parcourir la maison d'enchères est gratuit !
    Vérifier les biens en vente chaque jour peut révéler des objets vraiment merveilleux.${prompt}
  10046: |-
    Bien rencontré, aventurier.
    Si vous cherchez une arme pour trancher ces bêtes du désert, vous êtes au bon endroit.${prompt}
  10047: Pour les jours de pluie et les jours venteux, ou pour les jours où quelqu'un essaie de vous planter une lance dans le ventre, avoir une bonne armure peut vous tranquilliser.${prompt}
  10048: De nos jours, vous pouvez obtenir des armes et des armures à bon marché dans les maisons d'enchères. Mais la magie reste chère où que vous alliez.${prompt}
  10049: Pas de problème, Scamplix n'est pas un mauvais gars. Scamplix est un bon gars, vend des objets aux aventuriers. Scamplix a plein de bonnes choses pour vous.${prompt}

    Tu sais, si tu continues comme ça, personne ne se souviendra de toi.${prompt}
  10061: Même faire de petites faveurs au début, ça fonctionne. Si tu aides beaucoup de gens différents, tu gagneras petit à petit leur confiance. Avant que tu t'en rendes compte, tout le monde connaîtra ton nom.${prompt}

    ...${name-player} ?
    Je pense avoir un vague souvenir d'avoir entendu ce nom quelque part... Non, c'est parti.${prompt}

  10064: |-
    Hm ? ${name-player} ?
    J'ai déjà entendu ce nom. Il semble que tu sois en train de te construire une bonne réputation.${prompt}
  10065: Mais tu as encore un long chemin à parcourir avant de pouvoir dire que tu es vraiment célèbre. Le voyage de mille kilomètres commence par un seul pas, alors continue comme ça !${prompt}

    Bonjour, ${name-player}.
    J'ai entendu ton nom mentionné une ou deux fois ici récemment.${prompt}

    Oh, c'est ${name-player}.
    Ton nom revient souvent dans les conversations ces jours-ci.
    Tu dois être bien occupé là-bas.${prompt}
  10069: Écouter les discussions à ton sujet autour de l'oasis me rend tout fier. Je sais que c'est étrange, mais j'adore entendre parler des aventuriers qui réussissent à Rabao. Continue ton bon travail, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10070: |-
    Waouh, ${name-player} !
    Il n'y a pratiquement personne à Rabao qui n'ait pas entendu ton nom !
    Je n'arrive pas à croire tout le remue-ménage que tu as provoqué.${prompt}
  10071: Tu as rejoint les rangs des aventuriers véritablement grands ! Mais ne te contente pas de ta position ; vise le sommet !${prompt}
  10072: |-
    ${name-player} !
    Chaque fois que je parle avec toi, tu sembles avoir gagné en statut. Bientôt, je vais devoir prendre rendez-vous pour te parler !${prompt}

    Salut, ${name-player}.
    Tes exploits dans les pays voisins sont parvenus jusqu'ici à Rabao, et la gloire de ta réputation te précède.${prompt}

  10076: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}.
    Je t'ai connu lorsque tu commençais juste ici, mais de penser que tu arriverais à atteindre une telle gloire...${prompt}

    À Rabao et au-delà, ton nom est sur toutes les lèvres.
    Il ne serait pas exagéré de dire que tu as atteint le statut de héros à mes yeux.${prompt}

  10079: Owzie-wowzie ! Ne me fais pas parler. J'ai mal partout !${prompt}

  10084: Youpi ! C'est mon jour de chance !${prompt}
  10085: Laisse-moi me présenter. Je viens du Rhinostery à Windurst. Je fais des recherches sur divers êtres vivants.${prompt}
  10086: Et je suis le meilleur qu'ils aient ! J'étudie des phénomènes dans un endroit particulier.${prompt}
  10087: |-
    Quels phénomènes, me demandes-tu ? Eh bien, il y a ces énormes cristaux, tu vois !
    Et de ces cristaux, une étrange puissance s'en dégage sans cesse...${prompt}
  10088: "Ces cristaux se trouvent partout à Vana'diel, et leurs énergies affectent les écosystèmes environnants. \nNotre équipe de recherche avait étudié les émanations inhabituelles quand...${prompt}"

  10091: |-
    Notre théorie sur ce qui dormait à l'intérieur des cristaux s'est avérée juste, tout à fait correcte !
    Sauf qu'ils n'ont pas apprécié qu'on les réveille...
    Nous avons été attaqués...
    Nous avons été vaincus...${prompt}
  10092: |-
    Pourquoi détestent-ils tellement discuter avec nous au point de préférer se battre ?
    Et que se passerait-il à Vana'diel si quelqu'un venait à les vaincre ?${prompt}
  10093: |-
    Je parie que tu pourrais y arriver !
    Tu te considères comme un aventurier, n'est-ce pas ? Essaye donc !${prompt}

  10262: That trap was what he left to the world before he passed away. That trap and his treasure...${prompt}
  10263: What a way to go out! Now I'm studying his journal, trying to become as skilled as he was.${prompt}
  10264: The other day, while looking through that journal, I found an even greater trap. A trap that calls forth the spirit of the dead.${prompt}
  10265: I think that my grandfather left me these clues to try to tell me something, but I'm not sure that I can do this by myself.${prompt}

    Putting this here like this...

    I would have never thought...${prompt}
  10279: Yeah, yeah. Enough of the small talk. Are you going to open it, or what?${prompt}
  10280: Who are you?${prompt}
  10281: Name's Ryoma. I hired ${name-player} to open this box for me, but when it comes to treasure, I don't take any chances. I tagged along...just in case.${prompt}
  10282: |-
    No offense there, ${name-player}.
    Now, let's see what's inside. I've been waiting a long time for this day.${prompt}

    It's empty...
    There is nothing inside.${prompt}
  10287: It can't be! Where's the treasure!?${prompt}
  10288: Look for yourself. You won't find any treasure inside, because the box itself is the real treasure. Only a true master could craft such a fine work of art...${prompt}
  10289: Yes, it might have been easy to open, but I do not know if I will ever be able to copy what my grandfather has done.${prompt}
  10290: You'd better not be trying to pull a fast one, Leodarion. If I find out you're hiding any treasure from me...${prompt}
  10291: Unless you cannot see the box in front of you, Uncle Ryoma, the only treasure is there in Leodarion's hands.${prompt}
  10292: |-
    Ayaya...?
    Ayaya! What are you doing here?${prompt}
  10293: It is unfortunate that we must meet again under these circumstances, Uncle.${prompt}
  10294: I have been assigned by the Bastok government as the head of foreign policy relating to Norg. This includes observation of its members' actions...${prompt}
  10295: You mean...you've been watching me this whole time?${prompt}
  10296: I was just following my orders. When we learned that the members of Norg were once again searching for a lost treasure, I had no choice but to follow you here to gather information.${prompt}
  10297: So, you really are a Musketeer...${prompt}
  10298: Mister...Leodarion. I have heard your story from my father. I feel that I, too, know the true value of that treasure you hold.${prompt}
  10299: Wait... You're Yomi's daughter, aren't you? Yes, I finally think I know what my grandfather was trying to say in his will...${prompt}
  10300: A piece of that person lives on in everything a true master leaves behind. I can feel it whenever I see my mother's blade, just as you can with that box.${prompt}
  10301: I feel it even more when I see how that blade affects the lives of the people around it.${prompt}
  10302: Because of the message that my mother left for me within that blade, I was able to find my own path in life. That path led me to Norg.${prompt}
  10303: I see. As much as we try to follow in someone's footsteps, there are places that we will never reach. That is why we must concentrate on finding our own paths.${prompt}
  10304: |-
    Exactly.
    Uncle, would it be too much to ask to let Mister Leodarion keep his grandfather's box?${prompt}
  10305: |-
    Too much to ask? Who needs a dirty old empty box, anyway!?
    What a waste of time!${prompt}
  10306: Oh, and tell your good-for-nothing father to make sure that Kaede comes out to be a little more “understanding” than her sister!${prompt}
  10307: I will be sure to tell him, though I cannot guarantee that Kaede will grow up to be like my mother.${prompt}
  10308: Farewell.${prompt}

  10312: Wow...${prompt}
  10313: Anyway. I'm grateful for all you've done for me. That's why I'm going to let you in on my secret.${prompt}
  10314: 'Long ago, my grandfather hid his ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]} inside a treasure chest deep within the Kuftal Tunnel. After looking at this ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}, I think I can open it now.${prompt}'

    Yes. I knew I could do it!

  10323: One play is 100 gil, but as long as you keep paying, you can keep playing.${prompt}
  10324: For each 100 gil, you get one roll of our six-sided die. The number that appears is added to the running total for that day.${prompt}
  10325: The lucky adventurer who rolls the die that gets the running total over 400 wins...get this...a whopping 10000 gil!${prompt}
  10326: And that's not all! You'll receive extra prizes if the total comes to 401 or 402, and a super bonus prize if your roll brings the total to exactly 400!${prompt}
  10327: But be careful; the only time you can find out the running total is after you have rolled.${prompt}
  10328: |-
    And that's it! Pretty simple, huh?
    You can attack from the get go, or you can sit back while other people roll, and then come in for the final kill. We provide you with the die, you choose the strategy.${prompt}
  10329: Alright, enough talk, let's get rolling!${prompt}
  10330: |-
    You rolled a...${number: 1}!
    The running total is now ${number: 3}!${prompt}
  10331: Congratulations! Lady Luck has smiled on you today! Here's your 10000 gil!${prompt}
  10332: And because your roll put the running total at exactly 400, you receive a bonus prize!${prompt}
  10333: And for bringing the total so close to 400, here is your extra prize!${prompt}

    Oh, et bonne journée à vous, aventurier.
    Rudolfo de la Compagnie de Fret de Rabao "Si ça n'arrive pas du jour au lendemain, attendez", à votre service.${prompt}
  10463: |-
    Sanctia !
    Sanctia～!${prompt}
  10464: Monsieur Rudolfo, vous n'avez pas vu ma Sanctia quelque part, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10465: "Comme c'est jour de paie et tout, je voulais lui offrir un cadeau d'anniversaire en retard. \nJe ne la trouve nulle part...${prompt}"
  10466: Eh bien, je te cherchais, Chelvadurai.${prompt}
  10467: Si tu as de l'argent de trop qui traîne, qu'est-ce que tu dirais de me rembourser les dix mille gil que tu m'as empruntés ?${prompt}
  10468: |-
    Laisse tomber, Jeisson.
    L'armure de Sanctia tient par un fil depuis des mois.${prompt}
  10469: Tu ne peux pas t'attendre à ce qu'elle transporte du fret à travers le désert avec rien de plus qu'une paire de bottes et un sourire.${prompt}
  10470: Mais un homme doit payer ses dettes, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  10471: Tu as été chassé de la dernière ville à cause de problèmes d'argent, et pourtant tu donnes des sacs de gil à ce type de Lucky Roll...${prompt}
  10472: Je ne peux pas te contredire là-dessus. Je n'ai aucune excuse du tout.${prompt}
  10473: |-
    On sait tous ce que c'est que de traîner dans les Terres Extérieures avec ce salaire pitoyable, et Lucky Roll est le seul divertissement qu'on ait ici.
    Mais tu as une femme et un bébé à la maison, non ?${prompt}
  10474: Tu devrais envoyer chaque pièce de monnaie à ta famille, pas emprunter plus pour t'amuser.${prompt}
  10475: |-
    Tu as raison, tu as entièrement raison.
    À quoi pensais-je ?${prompt}
  10476: D'accord, assez parlé, vous tous.${prompt}
  10477: |-
    La prochaine livraison est-elle prête à partir ?
    À quoi je vous paye ? Retournez au travail.${prompt}
  10478: Au fait, Chelvadurai. Je t'ai donné la journée pour célébrer l'anniversaire de ta fille...${prompt}
  10479: |-
    Mais juste parce qu'elle n'est pas là ne signifie pas que tu peux prendre demain aussi.
    J'essaie de faire tourner une entreprise ici, tu comprends ?${prompt}
  10480: |-
    Oui, monsieur.
    Je comprends.${prompt}
  10481: '... Vous ne pensez pas qu''elle s''est enfuie, n''est-ce pas ?${prompt}'
  10482: Je veux dire, tu pourrais travailler toute ta vie et ne jamais rembourser ces prêts tout seul.${prompt}
  10483: Sanctia a encore au moins trente ans de travail devant elle, ce qui serait juste assez pour se débarrasser de ces dettes.${prompt}
  10484: Et je suis sûr qu'elle en est bien consciente maintenant.${prompt}
  10485: Pensez-vous vraiment qu'elle m'a laissé derrière elle...?${prompt}
  10486: |-
    C'est probablement pour le mieux, je dis.
    Il y a quelque chose qui ne va pas chez cette fille.${prompt}
  10487: Je parie qu'elle est partie chercher Tavnazia après avoir écouté toutes les histoires de fées de Zoriboh sur cet endroit.${prompt}

  10491: |-
    Il semble qu'un des transporteurs de marchandises ait disparu.
    Je me demande si elle en a eu assez et est partie ?${prompt}
  10492: |-
    Sanctia a toujours été une rêveuse, cependant.
    Elle a entendu trop d'histoires de coucher de Zoriboh et est devenue agitée, je parie.${prompt}
  10493: Vous dites que la petite Sanctia a disparu ?${prompt}
  10494: Ne me dites pas qu'elle a pris au sérieux ces histoires que j'ai entendues à Norg...${prompt}
  10495: Vous devez la retrouver pour moi, aventurier.${prompt}
  10496: Si ce que vous dites est vrai, elle se dirige probablement vers la nation perdue de Tavnazia.${prompt}
  10497: Cela signifie qu'elle sera à Norg, à la recherche d'un navire pour la conduire au Marquisat.${prompt}
  10498: |-
    Cet endroit est un repaire pour les pires pirates et voleurs.
    Je ne peux supporter l'idée de ce qui pourrait arriver à l'innocente petite Sanctia là-bas...${prompt}
  10499: |-
    Vous devez y aller avant qu'il ne lui arrive quoi que ce soit.
    Je vous payerai moi-même s'il le faut, mais s'il vous plaît, dépêchez-vous !${prompt}
  10500: J'ai vu mon lot de villes, mais Rabao est celle où je me sens le plus à l'aise.${prompt}
  10501: Je ne sais pas si c'est mon sang Galka qui parle, ou juste le doux murmure des sables du désert, mais cet endroit me dit “chez moi”.${prompt}
  10502: |-
    Elle est où !?
    Je ne peux pas croire que la petite Sanctia soit arrivée toute seule à l'Archipel de Tavnazia.
    Alors, elle planifie de devenir chasseuse de primes...${prompt}
  10503: |-
    Tout cela est de ma faute.
    Je n'aurais jamais dû lui remplir la tête avec toutes ces histoires d'aventure.${prompt}
  10504: 'J''ai parlé à Sanctia de deux célèbres chasseurs de primes : Goldmane de Tavnazia, et Ismenios Cutsilver de Bastok...${prompt}'
  10505: Ce duo a laissé sa marque dans l'histoire de Vana'diel avec les grandes actions qu'ils ont accomplies il y a vingt ans.${prompt}
  10506: Ils sont surtout connus pour avoir capturé le tristement célèbre chef de la Bande d'Atarefaunet et l'avoir remis au gouvernement de San d'Oria.${prompt}
  10507: La somme qu'ils ont reçue pour la capture d'Atarefaunet était censée être incroyablement élevée.${prompt}
  10508: Sanctia planifie probablement de devenir l'apprentie de Goldmane et de faire fortune en tant que chasseuse de primes.${prompt}
  10509: Je déteste l'admettre, mais les dettes de son père seraient impossibles à rembourser avec un salaire normal...${prompt}
  10510: Bref, je suis soulagé d'apprendre qu'elle n'est pas seule dans ses voyages.${prompt}
  10511: Ce mog a déjà voyagé et sait quels endroits éviter.${prompt}
  10512: |-
    Ce bon à rien de Chelvadurai.
    Ses habitudes de jeu sont responsables de tout cela.${prompt}
  10513: |-
    Je vais lui parler moi-même de sa fille.
    Tenez, vous avez fait votre part.${prompt}
  10514: Je vais informer Chelvadurai de ce qui est arrivé à sa fille.${prompt}
  10515: Et je vais aussi lui dire deux mots sur l'abandon de ses habitudes de jeu.${prompt}
  10516: Sanctia n'est toujours pas revenue à Rabao !?${prompt}
  10517: Son père a dit qu'il engagerait les services d'un aventurier, mais je me demande s'il sait même comment s'y prendre ?${prompt}
  10518: Zoriboh a mentionné qu'il connaissait l'aventurier parfait pour ce travail, cependant...${prompt}
  10519: ${name-player}, j'ai encore besoin de votre aide.${prompt}
  10520: Sanctia n'est pas revenue de Tavnazia, et son père et moi sommes inquiets.${prompt}
  10521: Elle doit toujours chercher Goldmane, le chasseur de primes dont je vous ai parlé.${prompt}
  10522: Je veux que vous suiviez Sanctia et que vous la gardiez hors de danger jusqu'à ce qu'elle le trouve ou qu'elle abandonne ses recherches.${prompt}
  10523: |-
    Qu'en dites-vous ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Je le ferai.
    Je n'ai pas le temps de jouer les baby-sitters.${prompt}
  10524: Je sais qu'elle est une vraie casse-tête, mais vous serez bien payé pour vos efforts.${prompt}
  10525: Oh, et donnez ceci à Sanctia quand vous la trouverez.${prompt}
  10526: Chelvadurai voulait qu'elle l'ait pour son anniversaire.${prompt}
  10527: Ramenez-la en sécurité.${prompt}
  10528: Trop occupé avec vos aventures pour aider quelqu'un, hein ?${prompt}
  10529: La petite Sanctia est devenue une aventurière !?${prompt}
  10530: |-
    Donc, Goldmane l'a convaincue que c'était le meilleur chemin...
    Eh bien, il serait à peu près le seul à qui elle écouterait.${prompt}
  10531: Au fait, vous souvenez-vous de lui avoir donné le paquet de son père à Sanctia ?${prompt}
  10532: Monsieur Zoriboh !${prompt}
  10533: |-
    Chelvadurai, nous parlions justement de vous.
    L'aventurier que nous avons engagé est revenu.
    Maintenant, à propos de Sanctia...${prompt}
  10534: |-
    Elle est devenue une aventurière !
    Et ce paquet est pour moi... ?${prompt}
  10535: |-
    Il y a une lettre à l'intérieur.
    Sanctia dit qu'elle enverra plus d'argent de ses aventures pour que je puisse rembourser mes prêts et retourner auprès de ma femme...${prompt}
  10536: |-
    C'est une bonne gamine.
    Il est temps pour vous de vous retrousser les manches et de suivre son exemple.${prompt}
  10537: J'ai bien l'intention de le faire, Monsieur Zoriboh.${prompt}
  10538: |-
    Merci pour toute votre aide, ${name-player}.
    Ce n'est pas grand-chose, mais voici un petit quelque chose de ma part.${prompt}
  10539: Si vous rencontrez à nouveau la petite Sanctia au cours de vos voyages, assurez-vous qu'elle ne fasse pas de bêtises.${prompt}
  10540: "Je ne la décevrai plus jamais. \nSi Sanctia se lasse de sa nouvelle vie, dites-lui qu'elle aura toujours une place ici avec moi.${prompt}"
  10541: |-
    Sanctia est encore jeune et pleine de feu.
    Je suis sûr qu'elle fera une excellente aventurière.${prompt}
  10542: |-
    J'ai entendu la nouvelle de Chelvadurai.
    Qui aurait cru que cette fille sortirait la tête des nuages assez longtemps pour faire quelque chose de constructif ?${prompt}
  10543: |-
    Eh bien, tant que je récupère mon argent, je m'en fiche.
    J'ai entendu dire que les aventuriers peuvent faire fortune de nos jours...${prompt}
  10544: |-
    Et une fois que Sanctia sera devenue une héroïne célèbre, elle pourra m'aider à faire de la publicité pour mon entreprise.
    Heh-heh-heh !${prompt}
  10545: |-
    Hmmm...
    Donc, vous avez entendu parler du ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}
  10546: |-
    Il y a plus dans cette rumeur que vous ne le savez.
    La branche et le fil que ces monstres ont avalés sont les matériaux de base pour une canne à pêche légendaire.${prompt}
  10547: |-
    Si vous parvenez à obtenir ces matériaux, apportez-les-moi ici.
    Je suis le seul encore en vie capable de fabriquer cette canne légendaire.${prompt}
  10548: |-
    Incroyable...
    C'est un exploit digne des plus grands pêcheurs de l'histoire.${prompt}
  10549: |-
    Laissez cela en ma garde.
    Revenez me voir lorsque le soleil aura accompli son cycle et vous serez le premier à contempler un esprit indestructible.${prompt}
  10550: |-
    S'il vous plaît, ne me pressez pas.
    La fabrication d'une légende n'est pas l'affaire de quelques instants.${prompt}
  10551: |-
    C'est terminé.
    Je dois vous remercier pour cette chance de créer une telle œuvre d'art.${prompt}
  10552: Cette canne à pêche ne se brisera jamais ni ne s'éclatera...${prompt}

    Trading cinder.${prompt}
  10621: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  10622: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  10623: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  10624: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  10625: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  10626: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  10627: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  10628: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  10629: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  10630: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  10631: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  10632: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  10633: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  10634: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  10635: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10636: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  10637: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  10638: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  10639: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  10640: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  10641: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  10642: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  10643: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  10644: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10645: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  10646: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  10647: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  10648: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  10649: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  10650: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  10651: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  10652: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  10653: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  10654: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  10655: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  10656: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  10657: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  10658: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  10659: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  10660: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  10661: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  10662: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  10663: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  10664: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  10665: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  10666: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  10667: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  10668: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  10669: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  10670: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  10671: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  10672: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  10673: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  10674: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  10675: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  10676: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  10677: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  10678: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  10679: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  10680: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  10681: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  10682: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  10683: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  10684: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  10685: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  10686: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  10687: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  10688: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  10689: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  10690: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  10691: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  10692: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  10693: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  10694: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  10695: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  10696: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  10697: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  10698: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  10699: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  10700: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  10701: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  10702: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  10703: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  10704: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}

    Oh, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too!
    What skills does it require? Let's see here...${prompt}
  10720: |-
    Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!
    Ain't synergy grand?${prompt}
  10721: |-
    Wait! No, don't tell me.
    You strike me as a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.${prompt}

    A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living.
    Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.${prompt}
  10724: |-
    I thought you'd never ask!
    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  10725: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  10726: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  10727: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  10728: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  10729: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  10730: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  10731: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  10732: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  10733: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}
  10734: |-
    That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers.
    Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!${prompt}
  10735: |-
    An aspiring synergist, I see!

    As promised, here's your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you!
    How's that for a deal?${prompt}
  10739: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.

  10746: Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt}
  10747: You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt}

    It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt}

    I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.
    Simple as that, kupo!${prompt}

    What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!
    Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt}
  10754: |-
    Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.

  10756: |-
    Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!
    It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt}
  10757: Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt}
  10758: |-
    If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!
    No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
    Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}
  10759: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt}
  10760: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt}
  10761: |-

    Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul.
    Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  10872: By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.${prompt}
  10873: 'At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}'
  10874: Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.${prompt}
  10875: That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.${prompt}
  10876: From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.${prompt}
  10877: But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.${prompt}
  10878: The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}

    As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.${prompt}

  11770: The twinkling light in their eyes reminds us that divinity is found in all of the Goddess's creatures--and their name reflects that.${prompt}
  11771: Yet even such mystical legends pale in comparison to those suggesting their presence in Vollbow.${prompt}
  11772: Errant troubadours spin tales of remnants sunk far beneath the Zafmlug Sea, claiming that these briny creatures nibble away at the encroaching kelp to keep the marble halls pristine.${prompt}
  11773: Perhaps they are naught more than tall tales, but some threads of truth give me pause.${prompt}
  11774: Ah, many a traveler has been wooed by the tale of the quicksilver blade, a myth from Aht Urhgan on the Aradjiah continent that locals hold to be true.${prompt}
  11775: An otherwise nondescript weaver spouted a most unusual experience he had when traversing the Silver Sea toward Azouph Isle. His vessel became shrouded in fog, and he scarce could see more than several ilms in front of himself.${prompt}
  11776: A blade of the purest silver burst from the sea and came crashing down, threatening to cleave the vessel from stem to stern.${prompt}
  11777: The young lad fainted from fright, and when he opened his eyes found himself surrounded on all sides by curious Qiqirns.${prompt}
  11778: The more superstitious of the common folk went stark mad, claiming that it was long-forgotten spirits from the Kingdom of Ephramad come to exact vengeance on the living.${prompt}
  11779: Fie, I say. Blades do not emerge from the depths of the sea. Doubtless it was a fish or similar sea creature of a more aggressive nature.${prompt}
  11780: But for such a piscine specimen to be mistaken for a blade of pure metal...the mind simply boggles, does it not?${prompt}
  11781: Some years ago there existed a seascape called Vunkerl Inlet in the region known as Derfland.${prompt}
  11782: Though many oceanic species dwelled in waters both shallow and deep, one in particular was said to be the apple of every fisherman's eye, for it was as bright as pure sunlight.${prompt}
  11783: I myself traveled to Derfland on one occasion, hoping to reel one in and make my name known throughout the land.${prompt}
  11784: But the claws of war plunged their way into my back and I was forced to retreat, my pride wounded as much as my flesh.${prompt}
  11785: Were I to recite my failures as a fisherman, that would doubtlessly be the first.${prompt}
  11786: Have you heard tales of the four legendary fish?${prompt}
  11787: 'They are ancient beings which numbered four: ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${item-singular: 1[2]}, ${item-singular: 2[2]}, and ${item-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  11788: Yet there were curious reports of a legendary fisherman who hauled in a fifth whose name was not listed in even the most complete fishing treatise.${prompt}
  11789: He was said to have found the beast in Misareaux Coast, abutting the Zafmlug Sea.${prompt}
  11790: Imitators quickly flocked to the area and cast their lines, hoping that fortune would smile on them...only to return hunched over and empty-handed.${prompt}
  11791: The fisherman came to be the laughingstock of his guild, ridiculed and belittled for claiming to catch something that by all accounts did not exist.${prompt}
  11792: One eve he departed the guild, never to be heard from again.${prompt}
  11793: Yet I cannot help but think there are grains of truth in that sandy story.${prompt}
  11794: Which reminds me...the tale goes that he cut open the stomachs of the four dragons and used the innards as bait.${prompt}
  11795: That leaves the small matter of the location...but I am quite certain you can figure it out.${prompt}
  11796: Far to the west lies the continent of Ulbuka, a land said to be at the heart of geomantic leylines. This story has been passed down from the primal geomancer through her five disciples and to the present day.${prompt}
  11797: Serpents are said to guard the vast natural energies pulsating in a cavernous region of the continent.${prompt}
  11798: These keepers of the gates fervently believe that the serpents are intimately connected with the lifestream and are immortal as long as that bond is not severed.${prompt}
  11799: Those selfsame keepers claim that something lives in the waters within the caves' deepest recesses.${prompt}
  11800: What fascinates me most about this legend is the idea that non-sentient beings can be connected to the lifestream.${prompt}
  11801: I have the utmost faith that if anyone could fish up a legend beyond legends, it would be you.${prompt}
  11802: And thus with bated breath I sit, anxiously awaiting your return.${prompt}

  12305: You will enter your opponent's territory whenever you go past the goal.${prompt}

    As such, I think my journey of rebirth may have begun from there...

    I'll write them a letter, so please go on ahead.
    You just need to enter the Quicksand Caves via the northwest entrance to the Western Altepa Desert.${prompt}
  12372: Once you're inside, head to the southeast and you should come across a small room containing the statue...${prompt}
  12373: |-
    Although, there is a rather special door along the way, and they say only an adult Galka can open it.
    I guess it's rather heavy.${prompt}

    Other than that, I heard there is one other way to open the door.
    You need something called ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}

    The one who told me about it said it could be obtained in the Eastern Altepa Desert.
    Fortunately, I was able to borrow one from him.${prompt}
  12377: Afterwards, head to the southeast and you should come across a small room containing the statue.${prompt}
  12378: Of course, it is possible that I still won't remember anything even after seeing the statue.${prompt}
  12379: |-
    But I can't just sit around doing nothing either.
    That is why I need your help.${prompt}
  12380: |-
    It seems the child known as Raebrimm came here from Bastok.
    Will you be taking him back home?${prompt}
  12381: |-
    Huh!? Are you mad--heading to the Quicksand Caves!?
    That place is crawling with Antica!${prompt}
  12382: You're the adventurer that was looking for Raebrimm, right?${prompt}
  12383: He was just asking me if there were any Galka in Rabao who are nearing their journey of rebirth.${prompt}
  12384: As far as I know, there aren't any at the current moment.${prompt}
  12385: However, if someone really is looking to abduct such a Galka, I gathered some volunteers to help patrol the area.${prompt}
  12386: Oh, look! There's Raebrimm now.${prompt}
  12387: ${name-player}!
  12388: I went on ahead to speak with the people in Rabao.${prompt}
  12389: Like Dancing Wolf said, there doesn't appear to be any Galka currently on their journey of rebirth here.${prompt}
  12390: However, that just might mean that they don't know of any or maybe they've already been abducted...${prompt}
  12391: Oh, that reminds me! I managed to remember a few more details regarding my rebirth!${prompt}
  12392: The mountain I climbed was a mountain in Valhalla, right?${prompt}
  12393: |-
    Once I knew that, I was finally able to remember!
    Someone on the mountain told me the following...${prompt}
  12394: “When the World Eater Egg is awakened, the Galka will be led to open the gate to the underworld...”${prompt}
  12395: |-
    The World Eater Egg... The gate to the underworld...
    We've learned a lot from the Destiny Destroyers.${prompt}
  12396: |-
    They mentioned that the Galka are special to Odin, the god of the underworld.
    So that must be why I was given that message...${prompt}
  12397: However, I'm not the Talekeeper, so I quickly forgot everything I was told.${prompt}
  12398: Besides, only the most elite Galka are capable of leading our people.${prompt}
  12399: That is why I must speak with the Talekeeper.${prompt}
  12400: 'Hey, ${choice: 6}[miss/mister]!'
  12401: Are you surprised to see me here!?${prompt}
  12402: '...I agreed to listen to what Gumbah had to say, but I never thought it would bring me here, of all places.${prompt}'
  12403: Iron Eater told me everything. The beastmen are after this “World Eater Egg” and it's all just one big mess.${prompt}
  12404: And Raebrimm had the eggshell, so that's why the black-clad Goblin was after him, right?${prompt}
  12405: So what about Raebrimm? Did he learn anything new here?${prompt}
  12406: What!? That dangerous mage known as Uran-Mafran did what now!?${prompt}
  12407: I see... I guess Cornelia was right to be worried.${prompt}
  12408: Is that true? I find it hard to believe that we visit some land known as Valhalla after we die.${prompt}
  12409: Well, even if it is true, what does that actually mean?${prompt}
  12410: And who is this master that Uran-Mafran is trying to bring back from Valhalla?${prompt}
  12411: |-
    Actually, that's not important right now.
    We should be more concerned about him learning the secret of our rebirth and trying to force open the gate to Valhalla.${prompt}
  12412: He is trying to stain the process of our rebirth, no?${prompt}
  12413: |-
    If that was the extent of it, that'd be one thing.
    However, if he destroys the gate in the process, that might mean that we could never be reborn again!${prompt}
  12414: I'm not sure if this Uran-Mafran knows where to find the gate to the underworld, but we should probably prepare for the worst.${prompt}
  12415: As such, it is imperative that we get there first and defend it from his evil plan.${prompt}
  12416: You're right! We should send a report to Bastok and then ask the soldiers here for help!${prompt}
  12417: |-
    Hmm... We don't have time to wait for reinforcements.
    I think we'll need to ask this adventurer here to assist us.${prompt}
  12418: You have already come this far... Will you help the Galka in our time of need?${prompt}
  12419: |-
    Will you help the Galka?
    ${selection-lines}
    You can count on me.
    Sorry, I can't.${prompt}
  12420: You've come this far! You can't give up now!${prompt}
  12421: |-
    I knew we could count on you.
    However, I must ask that you refrain from telling anyone about this unless absolutely necessary.${prompt}
  12422: Especially about the process of our rebirth and the location of the gate to the underworld.${prompt}
  12423: Okay, so the gate to the underworld that we must defend is located to the east of Reasoning Rock in the Western Altepa Desert.${prompt}
  12424: It lies beyond a door that we Galka commonly refer to as the Altepa Gate.${prompt}
  12425: Normally, one must perform a series of steps in order to open the door.${prompt}
  12426: However, it opens automatically when a Galka who is near death stands before it.${prompt}
  12427: Hmm... It would be nice if Uran-Mafran was unable to find a Galka currently on his journey...${prompt}
  12428: Wait, has anybody seen Raebrimm?${prompt}
  12429: |-
    Where is Raebrimm?

  12432: |-
    He's gone? You mean nobody knows where he is?
    I've got a bad feeling about this...${prompt}
  12433: |-
    Gumbah, you'd better report back to Bastok first.
    You can look for Raebrimm later.${prompt}
  12434: |-
    As for you, you should go on ahead.
    We need you to figure out how to open Altepa Gate.${prompt}

  12437: Don't worry. We've received word that messengers have been dispatched carrying the news that any Galka on a journey of rebirth is being targeted.${prompt}
  12438: |-
    However, we have no idea when they will arrive.
    So we have no choice but to rely on Oggbi for now.${prompt}
  12439: |-
    What!? Raebrimm was abducted by the mage Uran-Mafran!?
    When did that happen!?${prompt}
  12440: Well, I'm glad to hear that Raebrimm and everyone else are safe now, but this whole situation is making my head spin!${prompt}
  12441: |-
    This is quite the situation.
    I never imagined that the door to our rebirth could be closed...${prompt}
  12442: |-
    Oh! Please keep this information between us.
    I know you understand the reason why...${prompt}
  12443: |-
    This is most troubling news.
    I can't believe that the gateway to our rebirth is closed...${prompt}
  12444: |-
    It's the fault of that Tarutaru mage, Uran-Mafran.
    He's going to pay dearly for this!${prompt}
  12445: |-
    Ooh...
    To remember...and be remembered...${prompt}
  12446: Ask, and you shall retrieve!
  12447: Only a top Galka leader can get other Galka to follow him.${prompt}
  12448: That is why I need to tell the Talekeeper the secret message...${prompt}
  12449: I would be quite interested to hear this m-m-message as well.${prompt}
  12450: Uran-Mafran!?
  12451: Raebrimm, is that Uran-Mafran!?${prompt}
  12452: |-
    Yeah!
    Be careful! He's a real bad man!${prompt}
  12453: |-
    That hurts, you know.
    I am m-m-merely pursuing m-m-my own personal justice.${prompt}
  12454: Uran-Mafran, there are no Galka here who are on the journey of rebirth.${prompt}
  12455: |-
    Furthermore, a group of musketeers from Bastok is here to take you in.
    Surrender and come quietly.${prompt}
  12456: |-
    Is that so?
    Fine, I will surrender, but I want you to answer my question first.${prompt}
  12457: Wh-what!?
  12458: The beastmen in the group known as the Destiny Destroyers told me.${prompt}
  12459: Raebrimm, I know that you were given a special mission when you climbed the mountain in Valhalla as part of your rebirth.${prompt}
  12460: |-
    You were given the World Eater Egg eggshell and entrusted with a message.
    I want to know what that message was.${prompt}
  12461: When the World Eater Egg is awakened,${prompt}
  12462: the Galka will be led to open the gate to the underworld...${prompt}
  12463: |-
    Now I get it!
    I always knew you were special!${prompt}
  12464: You were chosen by my illustrious m-m-master, the Maelstrom Mage, Garazu-Horeizu!${prompt}
  12465: What!?
  12466: No!!!
  12467: |-
    Ooh...
    Memory...complete...${prompt}
  12468: Wh-wh-what does this mean!?${prompt}
  12469: No... I already know what it means.${prompt}
  12470: The musketeers told me that Uran-Mafran is capable of wielding highly unusual magic.${prompt}
  12471: I just never thought that I would've already been put under his spell!${prompt}
  12472: And even more than that, I now know that Raebrimm was abducted from right under our noses.${prompt}
  12473: I am ashamed for going all this time without even noticing it.${prompt}
  12474: Fortunately, you were able to rescue Raebrimm from Uran-Mafran after that.${prompt}
  12475: |-
    It's a bit late for me to be thanking you, but please let me do so anyway.
    You have my eternal gratitude.${prompt}
  12476: Raebrimm was abducted from right under our noses...${prompt}
  12477: I am ashamed for going all this time without even noticing it.${prompt}
  12478: |-
    Ooh...
    To remember...and be remembered...
    Ask, and you shall retrieve!${prompt}
  12479: |-
    You want to know about a suspicious-looking Tarutaru carrying an orb?
    Sorry, I haven't seen anyone rrresembling that description.${prompt}
  12480: |-
    I had no rrreason to lie to the rrresearcher.
    I plan to prrroperly apologize for my actions later.${prompt}
  12481: I received word from the musketeers regarding Raebrimm's passing.${prompt}
  12482: |-
    He was entrusted with an important destiny that could not be borne by any other.
    His success means that his life had meaning.${prompt}
  12483: As a Galka, I shall silently pray for him.${prompt}
  12484: |-
    How have you been?
    I trust your adventure is progressing apace?${prompt}
  12485: Every time I meet those Galka about to undergo their journey of rebirth, as well as those who have already done so, I am reminded of your bravery.${prompt}
  12486: Naturally, I often think of Raebrimm as well.${prompt}
  12487: I received word from the musketeers regarding Raebrimm's passing.${prompt}
  12488: |-
    He was entrusted with an important destiny that could not be borne by any other.
    His success means that his life had meaning.${prompt}
  12489: As a Galka, I shall silently pray for him.${prompt}
  12490: Raebrimm...${prompt}
  12491: Where have I heard that name before...${prompt}
  12492: I feel as if...I am forgetting something important...${prompt}
  12493: Hm? You know who I am, adventurer?${prompt}
  12494: |-
    Do you know Uran-Mafran?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, of course.
    No, sorry.${prompt}
  12495: |-
    I figured as much!
    I guess my magic did not work against you?${prompt}
  12496: Whether we have met or not, perhaps I have caused you to forget?${prompt}
  12497: Hold on... I feel as if we have fought before...${prompt}
  12498: |-
    Ah, that's it!
    Now I remember!${prompt}
  12499: You and your little friends stood in my way before I could complete my mission!${prompt}
  12500: |-
    The gate to the underworld...
    The Galka... That demon...${prompt}
  12501: |-
    Wait... The power source...
    Where is my orb!?${prompt}
  12502: |-
    Where is Uran-Mafran's orb?
    ${selection-lines}
    I have it.
    Sorry, I don't know.${prompt}
  12503: |-
    You can't hide it from me!
    I know you have it!${prompt}
  12504: I'll be taking that orb back right now!
  12505: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} was stolen from you!'
  12506: What? I-it's nearly empty!${prompt}
  12507: It had more than enough life magic to resurrect my master!${prompt}
  12508: |-
    What did you do!?
    What happened to its power!?${prompt}
  12509: |-
    Th-this can't be...
    My wise and powerful master, Garazu-Horeizu...${prompt}
  12510: You say he was devoured by Chaos!?${prompt}
  12511: |-
    I find that hard to believe.
    No, I refuse to believe it...${prompt}
  12512: I devoted my life to serving the family...${prompt}
  12513: '...${prompt}'
  12514: If I can gather enough power, even more power than before...
  12515: 'You find the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} lying on the ground.'
  12516: |-
    What!?
    You saw the evil mage Uran-Mafran!?${prompt}
  12517: |-
    I must report this encounter at once.
    He shall pay for what he did to Raebrimm!${prompt}
