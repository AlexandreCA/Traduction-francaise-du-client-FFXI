  7242: Oh, te voilà de retour. Eh bien, si tu es si heureux d’avoir vaincu un ou deux Orques, tu as encore un long chemin devant toi !${prompt}

  7246: Écoute, avant de me ramener quelque chose, tu dois d’abord accepter la mission ! C’est comme ça que ça fonctionne ici !${prompt}
  7247: Persistant, n’est-ce pas ? Avoir un Orque à ton actif ne fait pas de toi un héros ! Ah, j’ai exactement la mission qu’il te faut…${prompt}
  7248: Une patrouille contre les chauves-souris ! Qu’en dis-tu ? Ça ne devrait pas poser de problème pour un aventurier comme toi, non ?${prompt}
  7249: Voici ta mission, alors. Élimine les chauves-souris qui rôdent dans la Tombe du Roi Ranperre et ramène-moi une canine comme preuve.${prompt}
  7250: 'Ramène-moi ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} et ta mission sera un succès.${prompt}'

  7253: 'Voilà une ${item-singular: 3[2]} pour le poste de garde, alors. Mission terminée. Pas mal pour une nouvelle recrue.${prompt}'
  7254: Ah, la recrue est de retour ? Je suis désolé, mais je n’ai pas de temps pour toi aujourd’hui.${prompt}
  7255: Eh bien, peut-être que tu peux être utile. Beaucoup de nos enfants ont mystérieusement disparu, et je suis sûr que les Orques de Ghelsba sont derrière tout ça.${prompt}
  7256: Les Chevaliers Royaux devraient déjà être sur le coup, mais les deux princes se disputent sans cesse.${prompt}
  7257: Le prince Trion, l’aîné, dit que nous devrions lancer une attaque totale, et vite.${prompt}
  7258: Tandis que son jeune frère, le prince Pieuje, dit que la sécurité des enfants passe avant tout, et il refuse d’autoriser une attaque.${prompt}
  7259: Ils se disputent sur ce sujet depuis des jours. Les chevaliers sont paralysés, et franchement, personne ne sait quoi faire.${prompt}
  7260: Si tu veux vraiment te faire un nom, va à Ghelsba et sauve ces enfants kidnappés !${prompt}
  7261: Qu’en dis-tu ? Vas-tu y aller ?${prompt}
  7262: Voici ta mission, alors. Sauve les deux enfants kidnappés par les Orques de l’Avant-poste de Ghelsba.${prompt}
  7263: L’Avant-poste de Ghelsba se trouve au nord-ouest de Ronfaure Ouest. Prends le chemin avant la Porte Ouest, puis tourne à droite quand le chemin se sépare dans la forêt. Tu trouveras l’entrée dans les collines.${prompt}
  7264: Si tu as du mal à trouver le chemin, suis simplement un des soldats en patrouille.${prompt}
  7265: Les Orques ont tendance à garder leurs otages dans des tentes ou de petites cabanes. Une fois à l’intérieur du camp, vérifie d’abord ces endroits.${prompt}
  7266: Ah, te voilà de retour ! Tu es parti si longtemps, j’ai cru qu’une machine de guerre t’avait eu !${prompt}
  7267: Quoi qu’il en soit, mission terminée ! Et pour récompenser ton exploit…${prompt}
  7268: Par la présente, je te reconnais, ${name-player}, comme un aventurier certifié de San d’Oria ! Tu es maintenant de rang 2 pour les missions, aussi.${prompt}
  7269: Mais ne t’emballe pas trop. Ton titre est valide uniquement ici à San d’Oria, compris ?${prompt}
  7270: 'Pour devenir un véritable aventurier et porter ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, tu dois aussi être reconnu par Bastok et Windurst.${prompt}'
  7271: 'C’est un traité entre les trois nations, et sa parole fait loi. Je sais que c’est difficile, mais ce sont les règles.${prompt}'
  7272: Pour l’instant, fais tes preuves dans les zones près d’ici. Tôt ou tard, tu trouveras ton chemin vers d’autres contrées.${prompt}
  7273: Tu atteins le rang 2 !${prompt}
  7274: Il n’y a pas beaucoup de travail en ce moment. Je suppose que tu pourrais aller participer aux exercices de sauvetage des Chevaliers du Temple sur le Plateau de La Theine.${prompt}
  7275: Entre dans la forêt au-delà de la Porte Ouest et dirige-toi vers le sud-ouest. Tu arriveras bientôt sur le Plateau de La Theine.${prompt}
  7276: Une fois sur le plateau, continue jusqu’à ce que tu voies les chevaliers. Le terrain d’entraînement n’est pas loin de là.${prompt}
  7277: Ce n’est qu’un exercice, donc ça devrait être facile par rapport à ce que tu fais d’habitude. Suis les ordres et tout ira bien.${prompt}
  7278: Te voilà de retour ! J’ai entendu dire que l’exercice s’est transformé en quelque chose de bien plus périlleux. Mais un vrai combat est le meilleur entraînement pour les recrues, à mon avis.${prompt}
  7279: Quoi qu’il en soit, tu as bien travaillé. Je ferai appel à toi quand il y aura du travail à faire, maintenant.${prompt}
  7280: 'Tiens, prends ce ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Vas-y, tu l’as mérité.${prompt}'
  7281: Cette fois, c’est une mission de messager. L’un de nos chevaliers est en reconnaissance dans un endroit appelé Davoi, à la lisière sud de la Forêt de Jugner.${prompt}
  7282: La forteresse des Orques se trouve à Davoi, donc il est crucial que nous les empêchions de se regrouper, sinon ils pourraient lancer une attaque.${prompt}
  7283: Bien sûr, les Orques nous surveillent aussi. Il y a quelques jours à peine, une escouade de nos Chevaliers Royaux est tombée sous leurs haches.${prompt}
  7284: Nous avons envoyé des éclaireurs pour trouver une faiblesse dans leurs défenses. Tu dois trouver l’éclaireur là-bas maintenant, et ramener le dernier rapport de reconnaissance.${prompt}
  7285: L’éclaireur s’appelle Zantaviat. Il est quelque part à Davoi, mais je ne peux pas te dire où exactement.${prompt}
  7286: Reviens après avoir obtenu le rapport. Ces terres ne sont pas un endroit où flâner.${prompt}
  7287: Tu es de retour ! Et tu as ramené le rapport de reconnaissance. Bon travail, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7288: Des nouvelles troublantes, en effet. Il est dit que les Orques se rassemblent au fond du campement. Le moment d’agir approche !${prompt}
  7289: Mais ce n’est pas ton problème. Tu as bien travaillé aujourd’hui. Mission terminée !${prompt}
  7290: Oh, c’est toi, ${name-player}. Et au bon moment, en plus. Monarlais Halver cherche un aventurier comme toi.${prompt}
  7291: Entre dans le Château d’Oraguille. Monarlais Halver est là ; il t’expliquera en personne.${prompt}
  7292: Quoi ? Tu n’as pas encore été certifié à Bastok et Windurst ? Tu peux traîner, mais les autres ne le feront pas ! Bouge-toi !${prompt}
  7293: Ah, te voilà de retour. Je vois que tu as été certifié à Bastok et Windurst. Bon travail. Tu feras un excellent aventurier.${prompt}
  7294: Qu’est-ce que c’est, un rapport pour notre royaume ? Je vois. Apporte-le au monarlais quand tu y vas.${prompt}
  7295: 'Tu devrais recevoir ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} de Monarlais Halver. Maintenant, va au Château d’Oraguille et fais-leur savoir que tu es de retour !${prompt}'
  7296: Dépêche-toi d’aller au Château d’Oraguille et donne ce rapport à Monarlais Halver !${prompt}
  7297: Tu atteins le rang 3 !${prompt}
  7298: Ah ! Tu arrives au bon moment. Zantaviat, l’un de nos éclaireurs à Davoi, a besoin d’un aventurier.${prompt}
  7299: Il veut quelqu’un pour infiltrer Davoi et explorer derrière les lignes ennemies. Connais-tu quelqu’un qui correspond à cette description ?${prompt}
  7300: 'Maintenant que tu as ton ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, c’est l’occasion de prouver que tu le mérites !${prompt}'
  7301: La situation à Davoi empire de jour en jour. Ce ne sera pas facile, mais je ne peux pas penser à un meilleur aventurier pour ce travail !${prompt}
  7302: Te voilà de retour ! Zantaviat m’a tout raconté. Félicitations pour un travail bien fait !${prompt}
  7303: Mais nous ne pouvons pas baisser notre garde pour autant. Ces Orques ne vont pas rester là sans rien faire. Nous devons rester vigilants et agir avant eux !${prompt}
  7304: 'Voici ta récompense : ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Tu deviens tout à fait un aventurier, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}'
  7305: Bienvenue de retour ! J’ai une mission importante pour toi cette fois. Récemment, le terrain s’érode à cause de la formation de cristaux… et ça empire.${prompt}
  7306: Il y a une petite source à la lisière est de la Forêt de Jugner, appelée Source d’Eau Cristalline. Nous devons savoir quel effet la formation de cristaux a sur la faune là-bas.${prompt}
  7307: 'Je veux que tu me ramènes un poisson de la source. Et pas n’importe quel poisson ! Tu dois ramener ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7308: Ah, ça me rappelle – as-tu du matériel de pêche ? Tu en auras besoin pour cette mission.${prompt}
  7309: Il y a des gens autour qui savent une ou deux choses sur la pêche, si tu as besoin d’aide pour trouver et choisir ton matériel.${prompt}
  7310: Ah, le grand pêcheur est de retour ! J’étais inquiet, pour être honnête. Tout ce qu’on entend ces jours-ci, c’est le rassemblement des bêtes, l’érosion des Lignes de Cristal, et maintenant…${prompt}
  7311: '…des rumeurs selon lesquelles le Seigneur des Ombres lui-même est de retour !${prompt}'
  7312: Nous allons examiner le poisson que tu as ramené. Selon les résultats, nous devrons peut-être agir ! Je te ferai savoir si nous avons besoin de ton aide.${prompt}
  7313: Ah, c’est toi, ${name-player}. Tu arrives à point nommé. J’ai des nouvelles pour toi.${prompt}
  7314: Par ordre du Royaume de San d’Oria, tu dois te rendre à Jeuno en tant qu’attaché d’ambassade.${prompt}
  7315: Va au Château d’Oraguille. Monarlais Halver te dira tout ce que tu dois savoir.${prompt}

  7325: On dirait une mission assez importante. Je n’ai pas besoin de te rappeler que tu dois bien t’équiper avant de te lancer dans ce voyage.${prompt}
  7326: Je ne sais pas de quoi il s’agit, mais tu ferais mieux de te dépêcher. On ne fait pas attendre le monarlais !${prompt}
  7327: Tiens, mais c’est ${name-player} ! Ce n’est pas le moment de traîner, mon ami ! Le prince Trion te cherche.${prompt}
  7328: Pour cette prochaine mission, il t’a personnellement demandé. Tu devrais être honoré !${prompt}
  7329: Quant aux détails de la mission, je n’ai aucune idée de ce qu’il veut, mais il était pressé. Tu ferais mieux de te rendre au Château d’Oraguille !${prompt}
  7330: C’est une grande chose que tu as faite, ${name-player} ! Je savais au fond de mon cœur que tu étais la personne qu’il fallait pour cette tâche.${prompt}
  7331: Tu ferais mieux d’aller au château rapidement. Je parie qu’ils attendent tous ton retour pour t’accueillir.${prompt}
  7332: Tu as sauvé notre fier Royaume de San d’Oria. Non, tu es le sauveur de tout Vana’diel ! Il n’y a pas une âme qui ne te doive une immense gratitude, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7333: |-
    Ah, mais c’est ${name-player} !
    Tu ferais mieux de te dépêcher d’aller au Château d’Oraguille. On dirait que quelque chose de terrible se prépare là-bas.${prompt}
  7334: |-
    Tiens, mais c’est ${name-player} !
    Ton timing est parfait. Le château vient juste d’envoyer une demande pour un aventurier.${prompt}
  7335: On dirait que cette prochaine mission a un rapport avec la défunte reine. Tu devrais te sentir honoré. Ce n’est pas tous les jours qu’un aventurier peut travailler directement avec la famille royale.${prompt}
  7336: |-
    Parlé comme un vrai San d’Orien !
    Maintenant, dépêche-toi d’aller au Château d’Oraguille et obtiens les détails de la mission auprès de Monarlais Halver.${prompt}
  7337: Qu’est-ce qui ne va pas ? Traiter avec la royauté n’est pas ton fort ? Eh bien, réfléchis-y et reviens quand tu auras repris tes esprits.${prompt}
  7338: Le prince Trion demande l’aide d’un aventurier. Qu’en dis-tu ?${prompt}
  7339: Ça semble assez urgent, alors tu devrais te dépêcher d’aller au château. Le prince t’attend dans ses appartements.${prompt}
  7340: J’attendais plus de toi, ${name-player}. Si tu changes d’avis, reviens ici. Je serai là à t’attendre.${prompt}
  7341: J’ai reçu les détails de ta mission de la part du prince Trion. Je vais livrer ce livre aux érudits pour qu’ils le déchiffrent.${prompt}
  7342: 'Le déchiffrement du ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} prendra un temps considérable. Reviens plus tard pour un rapport.${prompt}'
  7343: 'Tu as remis le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} au garde.${prompt}'
  7344: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}. Nous t’attendions.
    Le prince Trion t’appelle. Je me demande si cela signifie que le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} a été complètement déchiffré.${prompt}
  7345: Bien joué, ${name-player} ! Je savais que tu ne décevrais pas le Royaume.${prompt}
  7346: J’ai l’honneur d’augmenter ton rang à 7 !${prompt}
  7347: Le papsque a du travail pour toi, ${name-player}. Es-tu prêt à accepter cette tâche ?${prompt}
  7348: Excellent. Rends-toi dans les appartements du papsque au troisième étage de la cathédrale.${prompt}
  7349: Le papsque peut sembler être un homme difficile, mais il est en réalité très bienveillant et compatissant. Si tu changes d’avis, je serai ici à t’attendre.${prompt}
  7350: La belle Claidie d’Oraguille t’a invité au château. Elle souhaite que tu voies les fleurs qui ont éclos à partir des graines que tu as rapportées d’Altepa.${prompt}
  7351: C’est un honneur d’être invité dans le jardin du château. Un jour, tu auras peut-être même l’occasion d’assister à l’une de leurs réceptions royales dans le jardin.${prompt}
  7352: Nous ne pouvons pas faire attendre la princesse. Maintenant, direction le château !${prompt}
  7353: Un groupe de Chevaliers Royaux stationnés à l’Avant-poste de Ghelsba a signalé une activité étrange des Orques au plus profond de la Grotte de Yughott.${prompt}
  7354: D’après tes rapports, nous savons déjà que les hommes-bêtes ont construit un portail géant, mais leurs motivations restent floues.${prompt}
  7355: Ça me fait frissonner de penser à ce que ces Orques préparent avec ce portail…${prompt}
  7356: ${name-player}, ta prochaine mission est de te rendre à Ghelsba et de poursuivre ton enquête sur les activités des Orques.${prompt}
  7357: Sois sur tes gardes lorsque tu t’aventures au plus profond de la Grotte de Yughott. Perdre un aventurier comme toi serait un coup dur pour tout San d’Oria.${prompt}
  7358: Je vois que tu as besoin de plus de temps pour te préparer. Quand tu seras prêt, je serai là à t’attendre.${prompt}
  7359: C’est difficile à croire que les Orques aient mis la main sur un équipement aussi dangereux. Il faudra envoyer plus de patrouilles pour empêcher tout nouveau développement dans leurs plans maléfiques.${prompt}
  7360: 'Et ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}… Nous devrons l’analyser et commencer à le reproduire pour nos forces. Nous ne pouvons pas laisser les Orques s’emparer du Trésor du Roi Dragon avant San d’Oria.${prompt}'
  7361: Eh bien, félicitations pour avoir terminé ta mission. Hmm ? Est-ce que je connais un aventurier nommé Eideialc ? Jamais entendu parler de lui.${prompt}
  7362: Mais tu n’as pas à t’inquiéter d’un voyageur insignifiant. Tu es dans une autre catégorie. Tu es maintenant de rang 8 !${prompt}
  7363: La cérémonie de passage à l’âge adulte de la princesse Claidie approche. Cette cérémonie est un aspect important de la tradition d’Oraguille.${prompt}
  7364: Monarlais Halver a lancé un appel aux aventuriers de haut rang pour leur assistance au Château d’Oraguille.${prompt}
  7365: Ah, la jeune princesse est enfin devenue une femme… Oh, désolé. Tu peux obtenir les détails de ta prochaine mission auprès de Sir Halver.${prompt}
  7366: Quoi ? Tu ne veux pas rendre la gentillesse que la princesse t’a montrée ces derniers mois ? Comme tu veux… mais si tu changes d’avis, tu sais où me trouver.${prompt}
  7367: Je suis occupé avec les préparatifs de la cérémonie de passage à l’âge adulte de la princesse Claidie. On ne sait pas quel genre de vermine pourrait rôder dans les rues et chercher des ennuis.${prompt}
  7368: La cérémonie de passage à l’âge adulte de la princesse Claidie est sur le point de commencer à la cathédrale. Je dois rester à mon poste, mais pourquoi n’y assisterais-tu pas ?${prompt}
  7369: Le roi a requis ton audience. Il t’a choisi parmi la montagne d’aventuriers de San d’Oria. Tu devrais te sentir honoré !${prompt}
  7370: Tu es passé d’un aventurier novice à un atout précieux pour notre royaume. Ne nous déçois pas.${prompt}
  7371: Pas besoin de modestie en un moment pareil. Le destin de San d’Oria est en jeu !${prompt}
  7372: Les autorités disent qu’un nuage sombre de désespoir plane sur le Royaume. Elles demandent l’aide des meilleurs aventuriers uniquement.${prompt}
  7373: Je ne peux penser à personne de plus qualifié que toi. Acceptes-tu cette mission ?${prompt}
  7374: |-
    Alors rends-toi à la Salle d’Audience dans le Château d’Oraguille.
    On dit que Son Altesse ne se sent pas très bien. Il se peut qu’il ne soit pas présent pour ton briefing.${prompt}
  7375: ${choice-player-gender}[Messire/Dame] ${name-player} ! Le Royaume compte sur toi. Qui d’autre, je te le demande, est digne de cette tâche ?${prompt}
  7376: Ah, une période de grands changements est sur nous. Dans quelques jours, les Rites de Succession auront lieu à la cathédrale de San d’Oria Nord. C’est à ce moment-là que le nouvel héritier du trône sera décidé.${prompt}
  7377: En raison des circonstances imprévisibles qui ont eu lieu lors de la cérémonie de passage à l’âge adulte de la princesse, cette fois, seules les personnes autorisées seront admises près des cérémonies. Cependant, la famille royale a requis tes services en tant que garde.${prompt}
  7378: Même nous, les Chevaliers Royaux, n’avons pas eu la permission d’y assister… Tu dois être très estimé par Son Altesse. Je t’envie, ${choice-player-gender}[Messire/Madame].${prompt}
  7379: Lorsque tu auras terminé tes préparatifs, rends-toi directement à la cathédrale pour faire ton rapport.${prompt}
  7380: En confidence, lequel des deux princes penses-tu qu’il devrait être le prochain héritier du trône ?${prompt}
  7381: |-
    C’est une décision difficile, mais…
    ${selection-lines}
    Trion est plus adapté.
    Pieuje est plus adapté.${prompt}
  7382: |-
    Hm…
    Étant l’aîné, il est le véritable héritier, et beaucoup de gens pensent qu’il est le plus apte à gouverner le Royaume. Cependant, les manières prudentes du prince Pieuje pourraient être ce qui manque à ce pays.${prompt}
  7383: Beaucoup pensent comme toi, ${choice-player-gender}[Messire/Dame] ${name-player}. Cependant, ce dont ce pays a peut-être besoin, c’est de quelqu’un qui ne reculera pas face à une menace – quelqu’un qui défendra la fierté du Royaume.${prompt}
  7384: Mais notre opinion n’a pas d’importance. Le Porteur de lumière décidera qui est le plus apte à diriger notre belle nation. Et ne dis pas un mot de notre échange d’aujourd’hui, car le monarlais nous fera couper la tête s’il l’apprend.${prompt}
  7385: Je comprends que tu aies besoin de beaucoup de préparatifs avant d’entreprendre une mission aussi importante. Prends ton temps et reviens ici quand tu seras prêt.${prompt}

    ${name-player}...
    Now that I have passed from the mortal realm, I have only you to turn to.
    The time left to me is short.
  7454: Thirty years ago, I came into contact with the insidious power of this land, and rose from the grave. However, at the same time, this world laid claim to a part of my soul...${prompt}
  7455: |-
    I have been released from the hate that consumed me, but the half of my soul that was taken captive all those years ago is calling to me...
    It has become a towering darkness. A raging hatred, spawned from the depths of my being...${prompt}
  7456: Very soon I will be drawn into that soul. I no longer have the strength to resist. The soul that was divided will become whole once more, and that rage will take on physical form.${prompt}
  7457: A new Shadow Lord will be born. Surely you have sensed the growing evil? The beastman armies that are imprisoned here are massing for battle. They plan a return to the world of their origin, the realm that exists beneath the light of hope.${prompt}
  7458: |-
    My link to you will soon be severed, so listen carefully.
    Thirty years ago, an expeditionary squad formed from the elite soldiers of each nation was sent to investigate the Northlands. You must have seen their memories when you first laid your hand upon the chunks of magicite.${prompt}
  7459: |-
    Seek out the markings that the expedition members left behind. They will aid you in gaining entrance to this world.
    You must defeat the Shadow Lord before our unification is complete.
    My hopes go with you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7460: There is an unusual arrangement of branches here.${prompt}
  7461: There is an unusual arrangement of pebbles here.${prompt}
  7462: The strands of grass here have been tied together.${prompt}
  7463: There is an unusual arrangement of leaves on the ground.${prompt}
  7464: |-
    I see you have met with Raogrimm.
    His soul is no longer confined to that incarnation of rage, the Shadow Lord, yet the fact remains that he has committed sins beyond redemption.${prompt}
  7465: In spite of those sins, I still wish to rescue him from the darkness. I no longer have a mortal body with which to act, and so the most I can do is guide you in my stead.${prompt}
  7466: 'You will need the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, a key that bridges the void between Vana''diel and that other world.${prompt}'
  7467: 'It is said that there are items in this world that gain a soul of their own through contact with the thoughts and dreams of other living creatures. The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is one of those items.${prompt}'
  7468: 'You must look for the Goblin peddlers. They are certain to have knowledge of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. When you have it safely within your grasp, seek out the markings that we left behind...${prompt}'
  7469: That world is a land now draped in the blackest night. We can pass from one world to the other, but without the physical forms lost to us thirty years ago, there is little we can do to intervene.${prompt}
  7470: Raogrimm is the one who... No, the world has been divided into separate realms through the machinations of the new Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  7471: The Shadow Lord resides in the Xarcabard of the other reality. However, I fear you would be marching to your death should you go to confront him... I ask you to first obtain trophies from four of the alternate realms.${prompt}
  7472: We understand that there is little time to spare. But without a certain degree of power, it will be impossible to traverse the land the Shadow Lord holds in thrall. Show me your strength with the four trophies you bring back.${prompt}
  7473: 'Those whose fate is linked to his world will empower the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to guide you...${prompt}'

  7478: I doubt you'll listen to the words of a traitor, but please, help free him from the bonds of his eternal night...
  7479: Our expedition was supposed to have been an allied effortaru, but not one of us was interested in the fate of the other nations. In our hasty-waste to outdo each other, we failed to see to the heart of the mattaru.${prompt}
  7480: |-
    Our attitudes led to the death of two of our members, and precipitated the birth of the Shadow Lord...
    This sin does not belong on Raogrimm's shoulders alone. We all mustaru atone for our actions.${prompt}
  7481: Please help him. Help Raogrimm escape from his horrid-worrid darkness, forever this time.
  7482: Humes and Galka have never been the best of friends. I used to think that was just the way it was, and always would be.${prompt}
  7483: I figured I'd be causing myself grrrief if I stuck my whiskers into other nations' problems. My next catnap was all that mattered to me in those days. Ignorrrance is bliss, as they say.${prompt}
  7484: Responsibility for Raogrimm's trrransformation lies with all of us who traveled with him on that expedition. By sharing the blame for the crimes he committed as the Shadow Lord, we can finally call ourselves his trrrue companions.${prompt}
  7485: |-
    Let me help you on your path. May guiding light fill this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    Raogrimm's fate is in your hands.
  7486: There is a broken branch thrust into the ground here.${prompt}
  7487: There is a symbol carved into the rock here.${prompt}
  7488: I have been waiting for you.${prompt}
  7489: |-
    Do you remember the last words Raogrimm spoke to you? "The link will soon be severed"...
    Do you understand the significance of these words?${prompt}
  7490: |-
    When the soul that was divided is whole once again, towering rage will take on physical form...
    Yes, a new Shadow Lord will be born. Even I will no longer hear his voice.${prompt}
  7491: Even now, I can barely feel the emanations of Raogrimm's faltering spirit. When those emanations fade completely, he will be...${prompt}
  7492: The Xarcabard of that other realm is shrouded in a vast darkness, preventing contact from the outside. Even those of us without material bodies are unable to penetrate that mist of eternal night.${prompt}
  7493: "Until that mist clears, I cannot guide you to Xarcabard. \nThe next place you must venture is the twin of Vana'diel's Beaucedine. There you will find the last trophy to complete the set of keys we need.${prompt}"
  7494: |-
    You must obtain the last trophy.
    All five trophies combined with our power will create a synergistic force, allowing us to part the shroud for a few precious moments. It will open a path between worlds.${prompt}
  7495: |-
    Take care, my brave adventurer.
    May the blessings of Altana guide and protect you...
  7496: |-
    Even after the blackest night, the golden sun always rises to begin a new morning.
    This troubled land will soon have its dawn...of that I am certain.${prompt}
  7497: |-
    I never thought to walk this land again, not even in death.
    Is this what they call karma...?${prompt}
  7498: |-
    This land has borne the weight of my sins.
    I will not beg for forgiveness, but accept my responsibility...${prompt}
  7499: |-
    So this is the reason for that unspeakable terror I feltaru here when I was still alive. It's possible that the other realm has existed for much longer than anyone ever dreamed...
    Keep your wits aboutaru you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  7500: |-
    I'm not rrreally fond of touching platitudes.
    Snap Raogrimm to his senses with a big ol' smack to the head for me.${prompt}

    It is time!
    Put an end to this thirty-year nightmare, ${name-player}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! Show us the path to Xarcabard!
  7502: Death does not exist in that realm. You might call it a “prison of souls.”${prompt}
  7503: |-
    Even those who fall in battle will rise again after a time as if nothing had happened.
    Like a flame returning to a candle whose light has been extinguished...${prompt}
  7504: It is an endless succession of life and death. How many times has that cycle repeated itself in that damned abode?${prompt}
  7505: There is one thing that bothers me. Whatever happened to the original wielders of the weapons and armor that the beastmen there now possess? If the statues in the shape of Orcs and such were once actual beastmen, then...? But I get carried away with my musings.${prompt}
  7506: |-
    Please pay no mind to my ramblings.
    You have secured the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. An incredible feat. It proves the strength of your conviction, and is one of the keys you will need to enter Xarcabard.${prompt}
  7507: |-
    You will need four such trophies.
    Once you have them within your grasp, make your way to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. Cornelia awaits you there.${prompt}
  7508: I don't know about the other four, but I can't hear his voice anymore...${prompt}
  7509: Is this another brand I must bear for my treachery? I must truly be hated if that's the case.${prompt}
  7510: |-
    It is something I would wish for at the moment, however. I pray this silence is just a continuation of our incompatible personalities.
    If not, then it means his pronouncement has become reality...${prompt}
  7511: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    This is more than just a testament to your strength. It is one of the keys that will lead you to Xarcabard, along with the trophies of the other realms.${prompt}
  7512: |-
    When you have all four trophies, travel to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. You will find Cornelia waiting for you there.
    That is all the wisdom I have left to give you.${prompt}
  7513: |-
    What is the true nature of that other world? I can only explain it as a place that lies beyond the limitarus of our knowledge.
    But I'm sure I've feltaru that aura somewhere before...${prompt}
  7514: That's it. That protocrystal I came across when I was doing research in Elshimo. The magical emanations coming from the crystal gave me a similar impression. An avatar? No, that can'taru be...${prompt}
  7515: |-
    Oh! Oh, I'm terribly-werribly sorry!
    I appear to have driftarued into my old habits.${prompt}
  7516: |-
    Now, ${name-player}.
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is both a symbol of your fortitude, and one of the keys that will help you gain access to Xarcabard. The trophies from the other three realms carry the same importance.${prompt}
  7517: Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, ${name-player}. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...${prompt}
  7518: The beastmen of that world carry the spoils of prrrevious battles. Equipment that you or I would use.${prompt}
  7519: I'm not able to touch them in my prrresent form, but I feel something about those weapons and armor...something extrrraordinary.${prompt}
  7520: |-
    Wait, wait, wait!
    I don't mean that they're currrsed or anything like that! It's something more like, um, not ominous, but...
    How can I explain it?${prompt}
  7521: Anyway! They're not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.${prompt}
  7522: |-
    But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order!
    You've got your paws on the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! It shows you've got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.${prompt}
  7523: But first you've got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.${prompt}
  7524: "${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and the four trophies.\nThese artifacts have long been lost to that other world. \nThe Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.${prompt}"
  7525: |-
    It must have been in the time of the Great War...
    Nobody knows how the Hydra artifacts came to be there, but those five trophies will open the path for you.${prompt}
  7526: Each of these items holds a measure of power. However, the strength of a single artifact is limited.${prompt}
  7527: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} and the ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.
    Combining these separate entities created a bridge from Vana'diel to the other realms.
    Xarcabard, I'm afraid, is another matter entirely...${prompt}
  7528: |-
    Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way.
    However, the five trophies resonate with another artifact that lies within his land. If we can join our strength to theirs...${prompt}
  7529: Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...${prompt}
  7530: Is it over...?${prompt}
  7531: No, the rage has merely been dispersed.${prompt}
  7532: As long as I exist, he will never truly die...${prompt}
  7533: Or perhaps an eternal soul is something beyond the concept of death?${prompt}
  7534: |-
    ${name-player}...
    You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented.
    I have not the words to express my gratitude.${prompt}
  7535: |-
    The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more.
    I have heard the voice of the one who holds sway over this realm...${prompt}
  7536: The one who holds sway...?${prompt}
  7537: |-
    Yes. From the center of infinite darkness.
    I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...${prompt}
  7538: |-
    You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell.
    The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.${prompt}
  7539: |-
    It was an error in judgment to shelter you...
    The order of my realm has been disrupted.${prompt}
  7540: |-
    I give to you a duty...
    You will stand vigil until an age without hatred has dawned.${prompt}
  7541: |-
    No matter what terrible power you might wield, there is no escape from Dynamis for an incomplete soul.
    No return to the land of blessed light...${prompt}
  7542: |-
    What manner of being was this who spoke from a pit of blackness?
    As this question gnawed at my mind, the voice grew quiet, leaving me in unanswered silence.${prompt}
  7543: |-
    Of one thing I was certain.
    This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.${prompt}
  7544: A flow of energy exists in Vana'diel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.${prompt}
  7545: |-
    Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow.
    It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.${prompt}
  7546: |-
    Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey.
    Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vana'diel.${prompt}
  7547: ${name-player}, you may be the one to witness this truth.${prompt}
  7548: |-
    The power stored in the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will soon be drained.
    And I must remain in this world in my role of observer.${prompt}
  7549: |-
    Do not forget who you are, ${name-player}.
    I bid farewell to a most heroic adventurer.${prompt}
  7550: My old companions...?
  7551: |-
    This duty is too much for just one to bear.
    If you will have me, I will stand at your side until an age without hatred has arrived.
    It pains me to see the depths to which my country has fallen.${prompt}
  7552: That is my only reason for staying. Do not misunderstand my motivations.${prompt}
  7553: |-
    Blessed light and the ruler of Dynamis?
    I do believe you've rekindled my long-forgotten sense of adventure.${prompt}
  7554: |-
    Once I've gotten all firedy-up, even you can'taru keep me back, Raogrimm.
    I'm sure my incomparable research skills will be of use in your task.${prompt}
  7555: |-
    C'mon, let's see a little excitement!
    This is our expedition's thirty-year rrreunion.${prompt}
  7556: |-
    It's not the Northlands this time.
    None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?${prompt}
  7557: |-
    I'm not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain.
    Better just give in and accept the fact that you're stuck with me.${prompt}
  7558: |-
    I thought this would be the end of you for sure...
    Hmph. You're just as thick-skinned as you used to be.${prompt}
  7559: |-

  7900: Mais maintenant que les monstres ont envahi l’endroit, mon travail nécessiterait de risquer ma vie. Aucun emploi ne vaut ça !${prompt}
  7901: 'J’ai décidé de ne pas y retourner, mais le Roi Dragon lui-même est venu me voir dans mes rêves et m’a dit : « J’ai soif… Apporte-moi de l’eau. »${prompt}'
  7902: J’aimerais l’aider, au moins en lui apportant de l’eau fraîche…${prompt}
  7903: J’ai une requête. Voudrais-tu aller à la tombe et remplacer l’offrande là-bas par de l’eau fraîche ?${prompt}
  7904: C’est… regrettable.${prompt}
  7905: 'Alors tu vas m’aider ? Excellent ! Prends ce ${item-singular: 0[2]} et apporte-le à la Tombe du Roi Ranperre, puis échange-le avec ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} que tu trouveras là-bas.${prompt}'
  7906: Pour te rendre à la Tombe du Roi Ranperre, sors par la Porte Est dans Ronfaure Est, puis dirige-toi vers le sud aussi loin que possible. Tu devrais la trouver rapidement.${prompt}
  7907: 'Tu as perdu le ${item-singular: 0[2]} ?${prompt}'
  7908: 'Il y a encore du ${item-singular: 0[2]} disponible, mais la question est de savoir comment le transporter…${prompt}'
  7909: Je n’ai pas d’autre outre à te donner. La dernière que j’avais, je l’ai reçue de la défunte reine elle-même…${prompt}
  7910: 'Et si on faisait comme ça : prends l’outre sur la pierre tombale dans la Tombe du Roi Ranperre, remplis-la à San d’Oria Sud, puis ramène-la à la tombe.${prompt}'
  7911: Considère cela comme une pénitence pour avoir perdu l’outre que je t’ai donnée. D’accord ? Je te souhaite un voyage en toute sécurité.${prompt}
  7912: 'Remplis l’outre avec du ${item-singular: 0[2]}, place-la dans la tombe du Roi Dragon, puis reviens me voir.${prompt}'
  7913: Prends l’outre sur la pierre tombale dans la Tombe du Roi Ranperre, remplis-la à San d’Oria Sud, puis ramène-la à la tombe.${prompt}
  7914: Tu trouves un puits.${prompt}
  7915: 'Tu remplis le ${item-singular: 1[2]} avec du ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  7916: Tu n’as pas besoin de plus d’eau.${prompt}
  7917: Je ne me souviens pas t’avoir demandé ça.${prompt}
  7918: Je te remercie, gentil aventurier. Sa Majesté, le défunt roi, te remercie aussi.${prompt}
  7919: Ce n’est pas grand-chose, mais accepte ceci en retour.${prompt}
  7920: 'Hein ? Qu’est-il arrivé au ${item-singular: 0[2]} ? S’il te plaît, tu dois me le ramener !${prompt}'
  7921: 'As-tu apporté le ${item-singular: 0[2]} ? Si tu l’as, donne-le-moi, s’il te plaît.${prompt}'
  7922: Eh bien, tu as perdu l’outre, mais voyager jusqu’à la tombe du défunt roi et en revenir n’est pas une mince affaire. Je te félicite.${prompt}
  7923: J’avais pensé déduire le coût de l’outre de ta récompense, mais je ne peux ignorer les efforts que tu as faits pour moi. Tu mérites ta récompense complète.${prompt}
  7924: Tu cherches du travail ? Eh bien, pourrrrais-tu ramasser d’autres peaux pour moi ?${prompt}
  7925: En tant qu’aventurier, tu devrais apprécier la satisfaction que procure le fait d’affiner tes compétences jour après jour.${prompt}
  7926: J’ai reçu trop de peaux de mouton récemment, alors pourrrrais-tu m’apporter autre chose cette fois-ci ?${prompt}
  7927: 'Je pourrais te fabriquer un beau morceau de cuir si tu pouvais me fournir trois ${item-plural: 0[2]} des Dunes de Valkurm.${prompt}'
  7928: 'Apporte-moi trois autres ${item-plural: 0[2]}, et je serai ravie de t’en fabriquer un autre !${prompt}'
  7929: 'Quel dommmage. Tu devrais savoir que les objets faits à partir de ${item-singular: 0[2]} se vendent à bon prix.${prompt}'

  7931: 'Alors, et les ${item-plural: 0[2]} ? J’ai besoin de trrrois d’entre eux pour fabriquer quoi que ce soit.${prompt}'
  7932: Je prends toujours des peaux de mouton aussi, alors reviens une fois que tu en auras trrrois.${prompt}
  7933: Tu les as apportés ? Quelle joie ! Tu apportes toujours les meilleures peaux, tu sais. Tu devrais travailler pour moi à plein temps !${prompt}
  7934: Je plaisantais. Je suis sûre que tu as plein de choses à faire. Attends iciii, et je vais me mettre au travail.${prompt}
  7935: C’est terminé ! Vrrraiment, une bonne peau fait toute la différence, je pense que tu seras d’accord.${prompt}
  7936: Reviens me voir !${prompt}

  7938: Ah, je vois que tu as bien progressé depuis notre dernière rencontre. Je crois que tu es prêt pour une autre tâche !${prompt}
  7939: J’aimerais que tu ailles aux Grottes d’Ordelle. Tu trouveras l’entrée dans une vallée sur le Plateau de La Theine.${prompt}
  7940: Ces grottes sont aussi appelées les « Grottes du Corps ». Sais-tu pourquoi ?${prompt}
  7941: C’est parce que les grottes ont une forme qui ressemble beaucoup au corps d’une personne. Tu es familier avec sa structure, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7942: Là où se trouverait le ventre dans un corps, dans les grottes coule une cascade d’une grande beauté. Je veux que tu visites la cascade et que tu reviennes ici.${prompt}
  7943: Cependant, je veux une preuve de ton voyage. Rapporte-moi quelque chose de cet endroit. Tu devras choisir quoi.${prompt}
  7944: En y repensant, la fois où j’ai envoyé quelqu’un d’autre à la cascade, lui aussi a eu beaucoup de mal ! Hé hé.${prompt}
  7945: Une preuve que tu es allé à la cascade, hein ? Ha ! Le vieux Balasiel t’a fait courir des errands, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  7946: Je vais te le dire, mais ne dis pas un mot au vieux ! Mets-toi dos à la cascade et regarde le plafond de la grotte. Tu verras une stalactite brillante.${prompt}
  7947: 'Rapporte ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} et tu seras un vrai spéléologue, crois-moi.${prompt}'
  7948: Hein ? Comment obtenir la goutte ? Ah… oui. C’est étrange, mais je n’arrive pas à me souvenir comment j’ai fait. C’était il y a longtemps, tu vois.${prompt}
  7949: Hmm… Peut-être que tu pourrais te renseigner. Je suis sûr que c’est écrit quelque part.${prompt}
  7950: Ah, te voilà de retour, et en un seul morceau ! Et tu as apporté une preuve de ton voyage à la cascade. Bien joué !${prompt}
  7951: Tiens, un certificat pour marquer ton exploit. Garde-le toujours !${prompt}
  7952: Quand tu auras encore progressé, reviens me voir. La prochaine fois, un test approfondi de ta valeur sera de mise !${prompt}

  7956: Je suis allé à la Grotte de Yughott hier. J’ai aidé un aventurier là-bas qui prétendait être en mission pour le Royaume.${prompt}
  7957: Pourquoi les monstres augmentent-ils si visiblement en nombre ?${prompt}
  7958: J’ai visité de nombreux endroits, essayant de découvrir les plans des hommes-bêtes, mais je n’ai jamais rencontré une telle créature.${prompt}
  7959: Je l’ai vu là-bas à l’entrée de la grotte. Heureusement, il n’a pas remarqué ma présence.${prompt}
  7960: Il était le même qu’il a toujours été – les bons côtés comme les mauvais.${prompt}
  7961: 'Ça me rappelle, j’ai revu la cascade. Je me souviens quand j’étais écuyer en formation, allant chercher ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, il y a si longtemps.${prompt}'
  7962: Un voyageur m’a dit l’autre jour qu’une certaine mousse peut aider à soulager les toux sévères.${prompt}
  7963: Peut-être que je vais en ramasser lors de ma prochaine patrouille, pour en donner à cet enfant et à sa mère. Je ne sais pas combien je pourrai en porter, cependant.${prompt}
  7964: Si seulement il y avait quelqu’un qui pourrait le livrer à ma place…${prompt}

    Parle-moi de la mousse.
    Parle-moi des baumes contre le froid.${prompt}
  7967: Hein ? De la mousse pour guérir les toux ?${prompt}
  7968: 'Eh bien, on dirait du ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. Une infusion de cette mousse amère guérit les toux les plus tenaces. Je l’ai utilisée moi-même !${prompt}'
  7969: 'Si tu as besoin de quelque chose pour les toux, apporte-moi ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, et je te ferai une infusion gratuitement.${prompt}'
  7970: 'Où pousse le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, tu demandes ? Eh bien, ma mère me disait qu’il poussait près d’une abbaye, mais je ne me souviens plus où c’était.${prompt}'
  7971: Que faire ? J’essayais de grimper sur cette planche au-dessus de la barricade et j’ai glissé et je suis tombé ! Ce truc est un danger public – tout mouillé et couvert de mousse comme ça.${prompt}
  7972: C’est sombre et humide là-dessous.${prompt}
  7973: Il y a beaucoup de mousse qui pousse ici.${prompt}
  7974: Cet endroit, c’est comme un labyrinthe ! Cela dit, je me suis déjà perdu dans mon propre jardin une fois…${prompt}
  7975: 'Oooh ! C’est ça ! C’est la mousse ! Je vais faire un excellent ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} avec ça. Attends un instant, ma chère.${prompt}'

  7978: L’infusion que je t’ai donnée, a-t-elle fonctionné ? Reviens me voir si tu as besoin d’aide, ma chère.${prompt}
  7979: 'Ceci… <toux>… C’est ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} ! Mais, je ne peux pas accepter quelque chose d’aussi précieux sans payer… payer !${prompt}'

  7981: Merci pour ton aide. Mon état s’est beaucoup amélioré grâce à toi !${prompt}
  7982: Un aventurier, hein ? La commerçante ici cherche quelqu’un comme toi. Elle est juste en haut de ces escaliers.${prompt}
  7983: Mon Dieu, mon Dieu. Si seulement un aventurier pouvait m’aider…${prompt}
  7984: 'J’ai reçu une commande de talismans votifs de la cathédrale. Mais je n’ai pas de ${item-plural: 0[2]} pour les fabriquer !${prompt}'
  7985: Aurais-tu la gentillesse d’aller dans la Forêt de Jugner et de collecter trois crocs de tigres forestiers là-bas ?${prompt}
  7986: Chaque trois crocs que tu m’apportes, je peux remplir une commande. Ça compterait beaucoup pour moi !${prompt}
  7987: Alors tu vas y aller ? Merci à toi. Souviens-toi, la Forêt de Jugner est remplie de tigres forestiers. Ils peuvent être un peu rudes, alors marche prudemment !${prompt}

  7992: 'Qu’est-ce que c’est, alors ? J’ai besoin de trois ${item-plural: 0[2]} avant de pouvoir te les acheter. C’est la politique du magasin, tu vois.${prompt}'

  7996: （ここでショップメニュー）${prompt}
  7997: Bienvenue, bienvenue ! Mes deux assistants seront ravis de vous aider !${prompt}
  7998: Ah, ça me rappelle. Il y avait un message de Brugaire, à propos de savoir si les armes qu’ils ont commandées étaient arrivées.${prompt}
  7999: Quoi ? Le Consortium Brugaire ? Oh, mon Dieu. Je viens de vérifier notre entrepôt, et nous n’avons pas du tout assez de stock pour préparer l’expédition.${prompt}
  8000: Peut-être pourrions-nous obtenir ce qu’il nous faut auprès d’un marchand libre ?${prompt}
  8001: Un marchand libre, hein ? Hmm… Je connais l’homme à qui demander. Tout ce qu’il nous faut maintenant, c’est quelqu’un pour aller lui demander pour nous…${prompt}
  8002: Et vous ? Vous avez l’air d’un aventurier. Nous avons besoin d’aide pour remplir une commande. Bien sûr, nous vous dédommagerons en conséquence.${prompt}
  8003: Un client a commandé une grande quantité d’armes, mais nous n’avons pas le stock pour répondre à la demande. Nous avons besoin de quelqu’un pour se procurer le reste auprès d’un marchand libre.${prompt}
  8004: Alors vous le ferez ? Merci beaucoup ! Écoutez bien, je vais vous expliquer ce que vous devez faire.${prompt}
  8005: Un marchand libre nommé Alexius passe souvent par la Forêt de Jugner. C’est l’un de nos fournisseurs d’armes.${prompt}
  8006: 'Prenez ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} et donnez-le à Alexius, il vous donnera ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} en échange. Rapportez-le ici.${prompt}'
  8007: Alexius est un esprit libre autant qu’un marchand libre, alors vous devrez fouiller la forêt pour le trouver.${prompt}
  8008: Hein ? Vous ne voulez pas le faire ? C’est dommage. Eh bien, revenez si vous changez d’avis.${prompt}
  8009: C’est une commande urgente, alors partez dès que possible. Souvenez-vous, donnez la commande au marchand libre Alexius dans la Forêt de Jugner.${prompt}
  8010: Vous êtes de retour, et avec le reçu ! Splendide. Grâce à vous, nous pouvons satisfaire le consortium !${prompt}
  8011: Voici un paiement pour vos services. Veillez à bien l’utiliser !${prompt}
  8012: Ah, l’aventurier est de retour ! Merci pour votre aide. Je frémis à l’idée de ce qui aurait pu arriver si vous n’étiez pas intervenu.${prompt}
  8013: Il est encore là…${prompt}
  8014: Il vient tous les jours pour regarder, mais jamais pour acheter ! On dit que c’est un Chevalier Royal, et qu’il est passionné par les armes.${prompt}
  8015: On raconte que dès qu’il n’est pas en service, il laisse son enfant et parcourt les boutiques d’armes… Même moi, je m’en lasserais à la longue !${prompt}

  8020: Bien sûr, je pourrais prendre les deux… Non, je ne peux pas ! La langue de ma femme est plus tranchante que n’importe quelle lame.${prompt}
  8021: Les dernières pièces sont vraiment des œuvres d’art. Je pourrais juste vendre l’épée que j’ai maintenant et… Non ! Je dois arrêter !${prompt}
  8022: Ah… Celle-là est une arme à deux mains, si je ne me trompe pas. C’est un peu cher, mais pas besoin d’acheter un bouclier, n’est-ce pas ? C’est… c’est tentant !${prompt}

  8102: Tu sais, beaucoup d’Elvaan vivaient autrefois à Davoi. Mais le village est tombé en ruine après la Grande Guerre d’il y a vingt ans. Une maladie appelée la fièvre de Davoi s’est propagée parmi les survivants.${prompt}
  8103: Fuyant les flammes de la guerre, les réfugiés de Davoi ont afflué à San d’Oria, mais pour ceux atteints de la fièvre de Davoi, il n’y avait pas d’échappatoire.${prompt}
  8104: La fièvre se caractérise par des toux violentes. Vers la fin, les toux deviennent incessantes, vidant la vie de la victime jusqu’à ce qu’elle meure.${prompt}
  8105: Heureusement, elle n’est pas contagieuse, mais malheureusement, il n’existe aucun remède connu.${prompt}

  8120: Je suppose…${prompt}

    Bienvenue à l’hôtel des ventes.
    Avez-vous des questions sur notre établissement ?${prompt}

    Que voulez-vous savoir ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Qu’est-ce que l’hôtel des ventes ?
    Comment fonctionnent les ventes ?

    Y a-t-il des limites ?
    Comment suivre les objets en vente ?
    Comment retirer un objet ?
    Ma liste de « ventes en cours » est pleine !
    Rien pour le moment.${prompt}
  8936: Les hôtels des ventes se trouvent dans toutes les grandes villes de Vana’diel. Les aventuriers s’y rassemblent pour enchérir sur des butins, des objets inutilisés, de vieilles armures… presque tout, en fait.${prompt}
  8937: Actuellement, les hôtels des ventes de Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst et Jeuno fonctionnent de manière indépendante. Les prix varient donc d'une ville à l'autre.${prompt}
  8938: Les aventuriers peuvent utiliser n’importe quel hôtel des ventes, quelle que soit leur nationalité.${prompt}
  8939: Le premier aventurier à faire une offre égale ou supérieure au prix demandé achètera automatiquement le produit.${prompt}
  8940: Une fois mis en vente, un objet reste aux enchères pour un maximum de trente semaines en temps de Vana’diel (soit environ neuf jours et demi en temps terrestre).${prompt}
  8941: Si un objet ne se vend pas dans ce délai, il sera renvoyé à la résidence actuelle du vendeur.${prompt}
  8942: Les frais de transaction sont proportionnels au prix fixé pour la vente. Le mode de calcul varie selon qu’il s’agit d’objets uniques ou empilables.${prompt}
  8943: Un frais de transaction est prélevé à chaque mise en vente. Ce frais n’est pas remboursable.${prompt}
  8944: Le Comité International des Hôtels des Ventes, ou CIHV, a fixé à sept le nombre maximum d’objets pouvant être mis en vente simultanément.${prompt}
  8945: Cependant, le CIHV a récemment supprimé la limite sur le nombre d’objets que l’on peut acheter.${prompt}
  8946: Un petit délai est nécessaire avant que de nouveaux objets n’apparaissent dans la liste des enchères.${prompt} 
  8947: Une fois qu’un objet apparaît dans votre liste « Ventes en cours », il se peut qu’il n’apparaisse pas immédiatement dans la liste des enchères. Si ce n’est pas le cas, réessayez un peu plus tard.${prompt}
  8948: Pour retirer un objet de la vente, rendez-vous à un hôtel des ventes et sélectionnez « Arrêter la vente » dans le menu « Ventes en cours ».${prompt}
  8949: Pour retirer un objet de votre liste « Ventes en cours », vous devez vous rendre à un comptoir des ventes et confirmer la vente ou le retour de l’objet.${prompt}
  8950: Sinon, les objets déjà vendus ou retournés continueront d’occuper votre liste, ce qui vous empêchera de mettre d’autres objets en vente.${prompt}
  8951: À tout comptoir des ventes, ouvrez le menu « Ventes en cours » et confirmez la transaction pour la retirer de la liste.${prompt}
  8952: Appuyez sur le bouton de confirmation pour retirer toute transaction affichée en jaune (vendue) ou en rouge (retournée).${prompt}
  8953: Y a-t-il autre chose que vous souhaiteriez savoir ?${prompt}

    Not right now.${prompt}
  9060: That's the spirit, my friend. Now, head to Davoi and search the Orcs' storage holes.${prompt}

  9065: Well, I'll be! ${choice-player-gender}[He/She]'s got more talent than you, I dare say.${prompt}

    Are you daring?

    Of course I am.
    No, not really.${prompt}
  9068: Hmph. Only the meek say such things.${prompt}
  9069: Hmph. At least you're honest.${prompt}
  9070: At any rate, my tale takes place in the church. Something is sometimes sighted there.${prompt}
  9071: What is, you ask? How obtuse! I speak of course of a spirit, a ghost! Have you not felt it so, by the look of the interior there?${prompt}
  9072: So, after learning of the rumors, I went to investigate.${prompt}
  9073: The catacombs underneath the structure were so frightening, even I was taken aback.${prompt}
  9074: But it scared me not, for soon I paid it no heed.${prompt}
  9075: Well? Did you find it or not?${prompt}
  9076: Why, you--! Silence, please. At least until the end.${prompt}
  9077: Anyway, I thought I might as well say a prayer, so I walked before the altar.${prompt}
  9078: And then, I felt my skin crawl. I tried to spin around, but I could not move!${prompt}
  9079: Ever I felt it creep closer. But I heard not a footstep!${prompt}
  9080: 'Hmm.${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  9081: Still I felt it draw closer, so I summoned all my strength to turn and look behind me.${prompt}
  9082: 'And I saw it right there! Right next to me!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}'
  9083: Was it floating in the air?${prompt}
  9084: Yes, and not only that, it wore a fine suit of armor. Obviously it was no mortal person, for I could see right through it.${prompt}
  9085: Thank heavens you're alive!${prompt}
  9086: Yes, well... Ere long it disappeared, surrendering but a glimpse to me. Yet that was enough, for I knew who it was.${prompt}
  9087: It was Rainemard.${prompt}
  9088: Rainemard? Yes, I've heard that name. Say, he was a red mage, like you! Ah, those were the days...${prompt}
  9089: This is no time to reminisce! Have you forgotten how he died? Surely he has come for revenge.${prompt}
  9090: Come to think of it, Rainemard had a daughter, didn't he? What was her name again?${prompt}
  9091: Did he? That I did not know. Pray tell, Valdero, who was she?${prompt}
  9092: Oh... I can't remember. Many an age has passed since those days.${prompt}
  9093: I see. Well, so ends my tale. What, you didn't like it? Forgive me! Rarely are ghost stories told well. At any rate, this is for you.${prompt}
  9094: Wait, I remembered her name! The daughter of the red mage Rainemard!${prompt}
  9095: It's about time. Well, tell us, then!${prompt}
  9096: It was Curilla... Yes, Curilla was her name. I remember Rainemard watched over her well.${prompt}
  9097: Curilla? Hmm... Curilla... I've heard that name before.${prompt}
  9098: Wait, the maiden general was named Curilla! Yes, she would be about that age, too. Who would have thought that she was Rainemard's daughter!${prompt}
  9099: It must be a terrible thing...to hear your father's spirit still wanders.${prompt}
  9100: Truly!${prompt}
  9101: I would not go to that church if I were you. There you'll find no coin, only intrigue.${prompt}
  9102: What? You went to the church? How impetuous of you. And, you met the ghost? Well, there's no stopping you!${prompt}
  9103: Well, it seems you faced great danger there. But you found new trappings for battle, so all is well. Isn't it, Sharzalion?${prompt}
  9104: What's the matter? It's not like you at all.${prompt}
  9105: So, the rumor was true...${prompt}
  9106: Rumor?${prompt}
  9107: Yes, about Rainemard's death. Some say he was killed because he knew too much.${prompt}
  9108: Too much about what?${prompt}
  9109: I do not know. Surely it would behoove us to delve no further. For my part, I shall pretend I haven't heard what was spoken here today.${prompt}
  9110: You're never this timid.${prompt}
  9111: Discretion, my friend, is the better part of valor.${prompt}
  9112: Say... I know a way to talk to the dead. What do you say?${prompt}
  9113: Valdero, no!${prompt}
  9114: 'In Fei''Yin there is an old fountain run dry. They say that you can call a spirit of the dead by simply casting ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} into it. At any rate, that place is a decrepit ruin, so there''s no end to the hogwash rumors.${prompt}'
  9115: Don't believe a word of it, my friend.${prompt}
  9116: Fei'Yin is no place for you. And something is amiss about all of this. I feel like something...some invisible hand is guiding us somewhere. I want nothing more to do with it!${prompt}
  9117: What, you traveled to Fei'Yin? And you say that the ghost of Rainemard needs help? I am sorry, friend, but I want nothing to do with this anymore.${prompt}
  9118: So, that whole church uproar was Rainemard's doing... Well, I am glad his spirit found rest, and you made it out safely.${prompt}
  9119: Adventurers must know when opportunity knocks! Though there is a fine line between bravery and foolishness!${prompt}
  9120: I love a good ghost story. The best part about running a tavern is listening to all the tales that adventurers bring from afar.${prompt}
  9121: 'In Fei''Yin there is an old fountain run dry. They say that you can call a spirit of the dead by simply casting ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} into it. At any rate, that place is a decrepit ruin, so there''s no end to the hogwash rumors.${prompt}'
  9122: So, the rumor was true? Huzzah! No, I need no thanks. I am happy to just hear your tale.${prompt}
  9123: But what could he mean by a “small dark tight place”? You'd best ask the other patrons or members of your own party for their insight.${prompt}
  9124: Yes, perhaps his corpse was interred in the Garlaige Citadel. What a cruel thing to do!${prompt}
  9125: All's well that ends well, as they say. I've had a ball hearing all about it! Please, stop by if you're ever in the neighborhood.${prompt}
  9126: You are brave to speak to me! But if you're looking for leads, I have none to share.${prompt}
  9127: 'Well, I am after a certain chest in the Garlaige Citadel. I hear you can open it with ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but I wonder if any treasure is hidden within.${prompt}'
  9128: You found a corpse inside? I was after that chest, but now I'm glad I never opened it.${prompt}
  9129: That's one jack-in-the-box I'll never meet!${prompt}
  9130: |-
    Did you get it?
    ${selection-lines}
    Haha, yes.
    Uh, no.${prompt}
  9131: Heh, I thought so. We adventurers need a sense of humor!${prompt}
  9132: You have so sense of humor.${prompt}
  9133: Hmm... My own weapons are still no match for them...${prompt}
  9134: Father!${prompt}
  9135: Oh, Ailbeche. Did you run that errand for me?${prompt}
  9136: Um, yes. And, I have a favor to ask you, too.${prompt}
  9137: A favor?${prompt}
  9138: 'Yes, I want ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. My friends said that then they''ll take me fishing.${prompt}'
  9139: Ailbeche, that's not something a true friend would say. You should pick your friends more carefully.${prompt}
  9140: And I have work to do. You know that, do you not?${prompt}
  9141: Yes, Father.${prompt}
  9142: 'Why, those ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} are from the Royal Knights. How came you by them? I should convey this to Prince Trion.${prompt}'
  9143: What do you want? I'm waiting for someone. Each time the door opens, I turn to look! Begone!${prompt}
  9144: This is no concern of yours. Leave at once!${prompt}
  9145: What are you here for? You ask about my son? Please, just go!${prompt}
  9146: I know all about the intrigue of the knights! I heard that something was amiss right when my son disappeared. I know they had something to do with it!${prompt}
  9147: I am an appraiser in the employ of Madam Hinaree. Her late husband was quite a collector. These are all fine works!${prompt}
  9148: The portrait above the stairs is especially valuable. It is by Mique, court artist of King Ranperre. Pity so few of his works survive!${prompt}
  9149: The greatest mystery surrounding Mique is his brush. It is said that its bristles turn ferocious when the painter is afraid, and delicate when he is sad.${prompt}
  9150: 'Any artist would desire ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. Some say it was hidden in Castle Zvahl, but I do not believe them.${prompt}'
  9151: Do you know anyone looking for a model? I could use the money.${prompt}
  9152: Chusarlaud used to paint my portrait a lot. He was so talented. Some of his paintings are right here in this tavern.${prompt}
  9153: But now, no one's doing portraits anymore, so I can't find any work!${prompt}
  9154: 'Still, he always wished he had ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} whenever his spirits were down. Vemalpeau, his father, looked for it too, but it was nowhere to be found.${prompt}'
  9155: What? You've never heard of Mique? Head to Madam Hinaree's mansion. A picture is worth a thousand words, they say.${prompt}
  9156: Why, you would offer this to me!? It's the paintbrush Chusarlaud always wanted. How did you know?${prompt}
  9157: In youth he wanted to be a painter. But, when his mother fell ill we lost the means, and he decided to become a knight. All on his own...${prompt}
  9158: I just couldn't ask him to quit, even though I wanted him to. He was our pride. How could such a thing happen to him?${prompt}
  9159: He has gone missing for nearly a year, but there is still a chance he lives. We've kept his room upstairs the way it's always been. Go see for yourself if you want to.${prompt}
  9160: Come to think of it, often he would read a letter from his commanding officer. Once I snatched it while he was away, but the paper was blank.${prompt}
  9161: The plume rests in the dry inkwell. ${prompt}
  9162: An unfinished letter. It says nothing special.${prompt}

    Leave it be.${prompt}
  9168: Father!${prompt}
  9169: What is it, Ailbeche?${prompt}
  9170: You're leaving on an expedition, right? Vilbert just left. Here's a sword. Now you can go, too.${prompt}
  9171: Expedition? What do you mean? Anyway, such a sword's no use to me.${prompt}
  9172: But, Father! Mother cleaned this sword every night! How could you have forgotten? It took me forever to remove the rust that has built up from your neglect!${prompt}
  9173: What?${prompt}
  9174: Oh, never mind!${prompt}
  9175: Ailbeche...${prompt}
  9176: What was he so excited about? Besides, my division is on standby. And where could Vilbert be heading?${prompt}
  9177: What, you want me to tell you about that paper? It's a special form my division uses for messages. The words are unseen, but they're there.${prompt}
  9178: We no longer use it, so let me tell you how it works.${prompt}
  9179: In Davoi there is a well that Orcs use. Dip the paper into its water and the writing will reappear.${prompt}
  9180: Long ago we used to keep the water in our inkwells to use when reading the messages, but now even mine is dry. Take this one to the well if you must read it.${prompt}
  9181: It says what? I would believe you, but I cannot.${prompt}
  9182: Oh, confound it! In my heart I wondered if he hadn't stumbled onto something too big for him. So, my fears were true...${prompt}
  9183: If only that fool would've let us know, and not kept his problems bottled up inside.${prompt}
  9184: At least now I know that something had happened to him. For that, I thank you.${prompt}
  9185: It broke my heart to learn about him, but now I know the truth. You'll always have my gratitude.${prompt}
  9186: Thank you for your help. I must inform Prince Trion of this unfortunate turn of events. I am summarizing my report now.${prompt}
  9187: Currently I am suggesting we sell all the weapons we purchased so far, but it's a pity we have to sell low what we bought high. Now I know how you adventurers must feel.${prompt}
  9188: My son and I are going fishing. I keep wanting to take the best pole for myself, but I am not who I once was. We will catch a big one with the same pole!${prompt}
  9189: Oh, you're back. Well, if you're so happy you defeated an Orc or two, you've a long way ahead of you!${prompt}
  9190: For one so new, I'd be... Hmm?${prompt}
  9191: Lord knight, forgive this interruption, but there is something I must ask of you.${prompt}
  9192: I question whether Queen Leaute truly passed away fifteen years past. Tell me, of what cause did she die?${prompt}
  9193: Who are you, and why do you pry with such inquiries?${prompt}
  9194: Please, I have traveled from afar to see Her Highness!${prompt}
  9195: You've what!?${prompt}
  9196: Very well. Listen closely. Fifteen years ago, Queen Leaute fell to a rare sickness. She left this world before we could save her.${prompt}
  9197: Ah, so an illness claimed her life.${prompt}
  9198: Well, it's none of your concern at any rate. Even if she lived, an adventurer like you could never see her, much less the inside of Chateau d'Oraguille.${prompt}
  9199: Er...${prompt}
  9200: What was the name of her illness?${prompt}
  9201: We are not told such things. Only the royal family would know.${prompt}
  9202: Is that so? Well, I thank you for your kindness, proud knight of San d'Oria.${prompt}
  9203: Hey, wait!${prompt}
  9204: What was the matter with that adventurer? He was awfully stubborn, wasn't he?${prompt}
  9205: He seemed to know the late queen personally, but how could he not be aware of her death?${prompt}
  9206: At any rate, your work is done. Excellent form, my friend!${prompt}
  9207: What, you want the mission from rank one again?${prompt}
  9208: 'I knew you''d return safely, and with the ${item-singular: 3[2]}. Mission completed!${prompt}'
  9209: Have you ever set foot into King Ranperre's Tomb?${prompt}
  9210: Two hundred years ago, the curtain fell on the golden age of San d'Oria. Civil war erupted over the Kingdom's hegemony.${prompt}
  9211: King Ranperre was there to extinguish the conflict. When he died he was interred in a great tomb south of East Ronfaure.${prompt}
  9212: But unknown hands have defiled his grave of late.${prompt}
  9213: Visitors report missing gravestones and shadows twisting in the caverns. Ravaging a royal tomb is an unforgivable crime!${prompt}
  9214: Your orders are to investigate the tomb and determine if there is any truth to what they say. Do you understand?${prompt}
  9215: |-
    Accept the mission?
    ${selection-lines}
    I accept.
    I do not accept.${prompt}
  9216: I implore you to make haste to King Ranperre's Tomb. You may find proof of grave-robbers there.${prompt}
  9217: But wander too deeply within, and Goblins might find you. Tread boldly, my friend, but do not go in over your head!${prompt}
  9218: Visitors report missing gravestones and shadows twisting in the caverns. Scour the tomb and determine if they speak the truth.${prompt}
  9219: Make haste to King Ranperre's Tomb. You may find proof of grave-robbers there.${prompt}
  9220: Have you really searched the tomb?${prompt}
  9221: So, you got this from bats in King Ranperre's Tomb?${prompt}
  9222: You see, this actually belonged to an Orc. What could Orcs want with the tomb?${prompt}
  9223: At any rate, your mission is over. Speak not a word of this to another.${prompt}
  9224: Ah, the recruit's back again? I'm sorry, but I've no time for you today.${prompt}
  9225: I know you came all this way, but I can't help you right now.${prompt}
  9226: Oh, who am I fooling? Of course I could use your help!${prompt}
  9227: Have you not heard? Orcs came and kidnapped some children! We think they're keeping them at their lair in Ghelsba.${prompt}
  9228: Why, not long ago came ill news from the cathedral. A boy training to be a friar went near Ghelsba and did not return. His name was Tedimout.${prompt}
  9229: The Royal Knights would march to his rescue, but Prince Trion is away in the north, and cannot give the order.${prompt}
  9230: Prince Pieuje is in earnest deliberations over whether to send Temple Knights instead. It seems his efforts are focused upon saving the children, but...${prompt}
  9231: But no matter. We need knowledge of the enemy. You must visit the cathedral and ask what this boy looks like.${prompt}
  9232: A boy training to be a friar went near Ghelsba and did not return. His name was Tedimout.${prompt}
  9233: The Temple Knights may be mobilized soon. You must visit the cathedral and ask what this boy looks like.${prompt}
  9234: Prince Trion just informed me of your handiwork. You've done beautifully.${prompt}
  9235: Due to your exemplary contribution, ${name-player}, San d'Oria hereby recognizes you as an adventurer of rank two.${prompt}
  9236: But do not let it go to your head. This certificate is valid only in San d'Oria.${prompt}
  9237: Work hard and better things will come, my friend. Someday your name will be known to our allies as well.${prompt}
  9238: Oh, and one more thing. The vicasque of the cathedral said he wants to thank you on behalf of the boy.${prompt}
  9239: You achieve rank two.${prompt}
  9240: At any rate, you completed the mission well enough. Time for a reward!${prompt}
  9241: I award you with rank points commensurate with your achievement.${prompt}
  9242: Prince Trion ordered scouts from the Royal Knights to Davoi, while Prince Pieuje ordered scouts from the Temple Knights. It's like the right hand knows not what the left is doing!${prompt}
  9243: Monarlais Halver is furious, but first he needs knowledge. You must find the scout from the Temple Knights, receive his scouting report, and return that report to the monarlais.${prompt}
  9244: 'What? You were told to hand the ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]} to Prince Pieuje personally?${prompt}'
  9245: Well, you should find His Highness in the cathedral.${prompt}
  9246: 'You''ve come just at the right time! Prince Trion wants a word with you. It seems he heard of you when you received your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  9247: Head to the chambers of Prince Trion inside Chateau d'Oraguille as soon as you're presentable!${prompt}
  9248: Prince Trion has called for you. Head to his chamber inside Chateau d'Oraguille as soon as you're presentable!${prompt}
  9249: I know not what Prince Trion wanted you to do, but see it through to the end! Understand?${prompt}
  9250: Hello there. Now's not the time for missions; Chateau d'Oraguille has been visited by bandits!${prompt}
  9251: You must make haste to Chateau d'Oraguille! Find Lady Curilla, general of the Temple Knights!${prompt}
  9252: Bandits infiltrating Chateau d'Oraguille is unprecedented in history! Make haste and see Lady Curilla, general of the Temple Knights!${prompt}

    Rahal has a letter for me to read, does he?
    Too busy to come himself, hmm?
    Well, let's see it...${prompt}
  9258: Ah. This is the handwriting of Ancolain B Feulart, former second in command of the Royal Knights.${prompt}
  9259: I was the one who relieved him of his command...${prompt}
  9260: |-
    Why are you doing this to me...?
    Surely you must know of the many victories I have achieved for the glory of San d'Oria!${prompt}
  9261: Yes, I am aware of them.${prompt}
  9262: Then why?${prompt}
  9263: |-
    There is a quality that your blade lacks.
    And that quality is sorrow. Rahal understands the sorrow in taking up his sword.${prompt}
  9264: |-
    Sorrow?
    We are not composers of verse!
    What use is sorrow to a warrior?${prompt}
  9265: |-
    And therein lies your arrogance.
    There have been many instances of you ignoring the orders of your general and leading the knights on a path of your own choosing.${prompt}
  9266: And haven't I always brought us to victory in doing so?${prompt}
  9267: |-
    At the cost of the lives of many of our men.
    It is an oversight too dangerous for a commander of our forces to make.${prompt}
  9268: |-
    What...!
    Ah, I understand.
    You're saying that San d'Oria has no further use for me.${prompt}
  9269: |-
    You miss my point.
    Once you have given consideration to my words, we can think about reinstating you to your position.${prompt}
  9270: |-
    No, I believe I will take my leave of the knights.
    I will find a place where I am appreciated for who I am.
    May you not regret your words here today, Sir Balasiel.${prompt}
  9271: "So Ancolain has issued a challenge to the Royal Knights, has he? \nIt seems my words had no effect upon him...\nA pity.${prompt}"
  9272: |-
    You have a wyvern that responds to your call?
    Your wyvern will be able to sense Ancolain's location from the shadow of the thoughts that still cling to the letter.
    That's all the help that I can give you.${prompt}
  9273: I'm glad they've run out of mulsum--it would completely ruin my diet!${prompt}
  9274: |-
    May I speak with you for a moment?
    Oh...it seems you have other matters to attend to. Perhaps another time.${prompt}
  9275: Next time I'm looking for an adventurer, you'll be first on my list.${prompt}
  9276: May I speak with you for a moment about the ecology of Vana'diel?${prompt}
  9277: |-
    Are you interested?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course!
    Sounds fascinating, but...${prompt}
  9278: Have you heard of Ordelle's Caves?${prompt}
  9279: Yes, those beautiful natural formations that wind their way under the La Theine Plateau.${prompt}
  9280: Are you aware that right now, a limestone-eating fiend is destroying the splendor of the caves with its voracious appetite?${prompt}
  9281: We need the assistance of upstanding, environmentally conscious adventurers such as yourself in ridding the caves of this monster. Can we count on your cooperation?${prompt}
  9282: |-
    Take on the task?

    You can count on me!

    Where could he have gone...?
    His wounds are still fresh. He requires more rest.${prompt}
  9294: Leaute, my sister. If you could only be here today... How proud you would be of your children. May you rest in peace knowing that.${prompt}
  9295: Now I must be on my way. I have no right to remain here in your kingdom.${prompt}
  9296: Ah, ${name-player}. I may be leaving San d'Oria, but this is not the end of my travels. No, it is just the beginning. The same is true for you, is it not?${prompt}
  9297: I have a feeling our paths may cross again one day. May we pray that when that day comes, San d'Oria will have regained the luster that it once had.${prompt}
  9298: One day far in the future, historians will look back on this moment as the end of a chapter in San d'Orian history.${prompt}
  9299: '...A chapter filled with blood, deceit, and chaos.${prompt}'
  9300: However, those historians will never know that the tale they describe would never have transpired, were it not for the deeds of one brave adventurer. It is often said that the greatest heroes are the ones who remain unknown.${prompt}
  9301: But who knows what the future holds for ${name-player}?${prompt}
  9302: Perhaps the pages of the next chapter will be graced with ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] name.${prompt}
  9303: But that is another story...${prompt}
  9304: What can be said is this:${prompt}
  9305: Even if one day Vana'diel were to vanish from the universe as we know it...${prompt}
  9306: The trials you endured in San d'Oria--the pain, the anger, the tears, and the laughter...${prompt}
  9307: Those memories will forever remain in your heart and never fade...${prompt}
  9308: Until the end...${prompt}
  9309: The end of time...${prompt}
  9310: Ah, you look as if you have spent many a day with a polearm by your side. Long I have been waiting for an adventurer of your caliber.${prompt}
  9311: Prince Trion has entrusted me with an important task. Let me explain...${prompt}
  9312: While there is not an army in all of Vana'diel that can match the swordsmanship of the San d'Orian knights, our ranks still lack training in polearm techniques. This lack in skill restricts our versatility in battle.${prompt}
  9313: Back in the age when the Dragon King ruled the land, even the captain of the Royal Knights, Erpalacion, was a master with the spear. However, with the decline in the number of dragoons, the techniques that those great men used have all but been lost.${prompt}
  9314: To deal with this looming problem, the prince has asked me to construct a set of guidelines in mastering the art of the polearm.${prompt}
  9315: That is where you come in. I would like you to assist me in testing the new guidelines I have come up with.${prompt}
  9316: |-
    Can you lend your assistance?
    ${selection-lines}
    I would be honored!
    I have affairs of greater importance.${prompt}
  9317: |-
    Spoken like a true purveyor of strength.
    We shall begin by conducting basic training.${prompt}
  9318: Take this polearm and fight to your heart's content. The weapon will transmit its power into your body. When it has been drained of all its energy, you will know that your skills have been refined and your training is near complete.${prompt}
  9319: When you feel that time has come, return to me with the spear, and I will evaluate your progress.${prompt}
  9320: |-
    I see...
    It is not every day that I meet an adventurer with your skill. I was sure that both of us could have benefited from my offer...
    If you ever have a change of heart, I will be waiting here for your return.${prompt}
  9321: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}. How goes your training?
    Show me the polearm I entrusted to you and I can evaluate your progress. Or have you called upon me for another reason...?${prompt}
  9322: |-
    What is the purpose of your visit?
    ${selection-lines}
    I have lost the ${item-singular: 1[2]}...
    I request to withdraw from the training.
    I was just passing by.${prompt}
  9323: |-
    Lost it? You have lost it!?
    Why, do you realize the trouble I was forced to go through with those crooks at the Brugaire Consortium to obtain that polearm?${prompt}
  9324: |-
    <Sigh>
    ...I apologize for my outburst. It was I who requested your services in this matter. Please, take this spear and continue your training. However, you will have to start from the beginning.
    And please try not to lose this one...${prompt}
  9325: Was what I asked too much for even you? No, it could not be... My years of experience led me to the construction of those training guidelines.${prompt}
  9326: |-
    You are not truly considering giving up?
    ${selection-lines}
    I have had enough.
    On second thought...${prompt}
  9327: I knew that you were the one for this task. Anyone who cannot handle simple training such as this does not have the right to hold a polearm in their hands.${prompt}
  9328: If you grow weary of your training, then feel free to rest. While glory does not befall those who run from the hardships they face, it must also be remembered that a true master is not born in a single day's time. ${prompt}
  9329: What is this? Have you no faith in my guidelines?${prompt}
  9330: |-
    I cannot believe what I am hearing...
    Leave me be! I will search for a more suited adventurer to take on this task.${prompt}
  9331: I am sorry, but I do not believe that you have used this weapon to its full extent. Continue your training. You will know when you have reached your goal.${prompt}
  9332: |-
    Excellent!
    The wear of this weapon is a direct reflection of your progress.${prompt}
  9333: Now all that remains is the final portion of your training, where you must use your newly acquired techniques in a battle to the death. This will not be easy, but I am sure that your experience will guide you to victory.${prompt}
  9334: 'Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and travel to the Sea Serpent Grotto. There you will find ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} buried in the earth. You are to bring that back here to me.${prompt}'
  9335: Do not think of this as a simple errand. This is your final test, and it will require all the knowledge and experience you have acquired through the course of this training.${prompt}
  9336: 'Now go prepare yourself for this battle in the way you see fit. You will no longer need the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  9337: |-
    Take that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and travel to the Sea Serpent Grotto. There you will find ${keyitem-article: 2[2]} buried in the earth. You are to bring that back here to me.
    Good luck.${prompt}
  9338: You look much stronger than when I last saw you. You must have successfully completed the training course I laid out in my guidelines!${prompt}
  9339: This proves that my methods can be of great importance to the Kingdom! I look forward to the day when our knights reach the level that you have already acquired.${prompt}
  9340: Balasiel, how goes the preparation of our new guidelines?${prompt}
  9341: |-
    My Lord!
    With the assistance of this noble ${choice-player-gender}[gentleman/lady], I have been able to complete my writing. It will not be long before those wretched Orcs tremble at the sight of our newly trained knights.${prompt}
  9342: |-
    That is good news indeed.
    ${name-player}, I thank you for your work in helping San d'Oria. I think that I might head over to the training grounds myself for a firsthand try at these new techniques.${prompt}
  9343: Prince Trion, you cannot be serious...!${prompt}
  9344: Hah hah hah! Balasiel, of course it was a joke!${prompt}
  9345: I apologize, my Lord. However, it did not sound much like a joke...${prompt}
  9346: Balasiel. Once you have completed your report, deliver it to Monarlais Halver. He will continue the preparations from there.${prompt}
  9347: Yes, my Lord!${prompt}
  9348: |-
    I cannot thank you enough for all you have done. Were it not for you, I could not have completed my work.
    Soon, all the knights of San d'Oria will be polishing their polearm skills with the new “${name-player} Method.”${prompt}
  9349: I regret that I cannot reimburse you for the time you have spent assisting me. However, you will soon realize that your training has unlocked a powerful force inside you. This new skill is your true reward.${prompt}
  9350: I thank you again for your assistance. And remember, this newly acquired skill is not the end of your training, but the beginning.${prompt}
  9351: You have learned the weapon skill “Impulse Drive”!${prompt}
  9352: |-
    Good day, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madame].
    My name is Phillone. I recently moved here from Bastok with my husband and younger brother.${prompt}
  9353: "And where are they now, you ask? They...they are quite busy with their work! So much so that I rarely see them at home these days. \nPlease stop by for another visit sometime!${prompt}"
  9354: I must remain calm...stay focused. I've finally been given a chance to rise above this sorry gate-guard existence. If only I could show them what I'm worth...${prompt}
  9355: Wha-!${prompt}
  9356: My duty is to guard this city gate! I was certainly not considering running off to catch that thief for tawdry fame and glory!${prompt}
  9357: '...${prompt}'
  9358: Oh, it's just an adventurer. You startled me.${prompt}
  9359: A burglar broke into the royal treasury the other day and pilfered the precious Scepter Royaulais.${prompt}
  9360: Mayhap it was you!?${prompt}
  9361: No, your face does not match that of the sketch I saw.${prompt}
  9362: |-
    I apologize for my hasty accusation.
    The Temple Knights have scoured the entire Kingdom, but have yet to discover a single clue regarding the thief's whereabouts.${prompt}
  9363: Have you not heard of the Scepter Royaulais? It is the scepter borne by the king, a symbol of office bestowed by the papsque at the coronation ceremony.${prompt}
  9364: I, too, wish to make a name for myself in this world someday.${prompt}
  9365: We've finally found a lead!${prompt}
  9366: A traveling merchant has reported a suspicious character lurking in La Theine Plateau! It may just be the burglar we're looking for.${prompt}
  9367: You speak truly!?${prompt}
  9368: |-
    I am Elmemague of the Temple Knights.
    I must travel to the rescue drill site in La Theine Plateau and join my fellows.${prompt}
  9369: |-
    However, if our quarry is the burglar who managed to infiltrate the chateau single-handedly, I worry that our numbers may be too few.
    I ask that you contact the Royal Knights to send reinforcements!${prompt}
  9370: The Royal Knights are posted beyond the borders of the Kingdom! Recruiting the assistance of even the closest knights will take time.${prompt}
  9371: Dash it all! The scoundrel will not tarry long...${prompt}
  9372: Why, the solution stands right before you! I understand that it may be dangerous, but someone must accompany...${prompt}
  9373: "Of course! \nAdventurer! Will you not lend a hand? If the thief is caught, you will be rewarded most handsomely!${prompt}"
  9374: Wait, what I meant was I could go with...${prompt}
  9375: Come, adventurer! The royal treasure must be wrested from the hands of that villain!${prompt}
  9376: |-
    Will you help?
    ${selection-lines}
    Lead the way!
    I cannot help at this time...${prompt}
  9377: |-
    I see...
    If you happen to change your mind, talk to the guard here. Your help would be greatly appreciated.${prompt}
  9378: You will help? Splendid! Then let us be off to La Theine Plateau and join forces with the rest of my men!${prompt}
  9379: I, uh, I will accompany you on this important...${prompt}
  9380: You must remain here. When the knights return from their patrols, tell them to make haste to La Theine Plateau.${prompt}
  9381: '...Yes, sir.${prompt}'
  9382: No dithering now, adventurer! We leave immediately!${prompt}
  9383: |-
    It is of no matter. I'm not the slightest bit disappointed.
    “Lowly gate-guard” seems to be my lot in this life...${prompt}
  9384: Well, that is a shame. We could have used your help.${prompt}
  9385: I will return anon!${prompt}
  9386: |-
    It is of no matter, no matter at all.
    “Lowly gate-guard” seems to be my lot in this life...${prompt}
  9387: Sir Elmemague has asked for the assistance of adventurers in the capture of the suspected thief lurking in La Theine Plateau...${prompt}
  9388: Then you must make haste for La Theine Plateau. The knights there will give you further instructions.${prompt}
  9389: |-
    I see.
    If it were me, I'd offer up my sword in a heartbeat...${prompt}
  9390: |-
    You've forgotten already?
    Make for La Theine Plateau, and the knights there will give you further instructions.${prompt}
  9391: I'm not feeling the smallest shred of envy. I have absolutely no interest in proving myself through acts of honor and courage...${prompt}
  9392: Oh, it's you. How did you fare?${prompt}
  9393: So they caught him, did they? How wonderful it must be to stand at the forefront of action...${prompt}
  9394: Is it true!?${prompt}
  9395: And you are, madame?${prompt}
  9396: |-
    My name is Phillone.
    What has become of the one who stole the Scepter Royaulais? Did they catch him? Is he unharmed?${prompt}
  9397: A highly suspicious character was apprehended in La Theine, but whether or not he is the criminal remains to be seen...${prompt}
  9398: He's not a bad pers...he is no criminal. Please, you must help him!${prompt}
  9399: The suspect?${prompt}
  9400: You are an adventurer, are you not? I beg you, you have to do something!${prompt}
  9401: It is out of our hands...${prompt}
  9402: '...${prompt}'
  9403: My pardon for my wife's behavior. I am her husband, Roido.${prompt}
  9404: Come now, Phillone, let's go home. It'll be all right. You'll see.${prompt}
  9405: But...${prompt}
  9406: I said, let's go...!${prompt}
  9407: What was she on about, I wonder...${prompt}
  9408: Ah yes, I almost forgot. If the man they caught is really the burglar, you will be eligible for a reward from Monarlais Halver. Why don't you head over to the chateau and check on the proceedings?${prompt}
  9409: If the man they caught is really the burglar, you will be eligible for a reward from Monarlais Halver. Why don't you head over to the chateau and check on the proceedings?${prompt}
  9410: |-
    I apologize for my outburst earlier. I've been a little under the weather...
    Please, forget I said anything.${prompt}
  9411: Hmm, so the man they caught wasn't the one who stole the Scepter Royaulais?${prompt}
  9412: "Which means I still have a chance! I'm going to catch that thief and show everyone what I'm made of. \nI'll be a famous knight yet!${prompt}"
  9413: '...${prompt}'
  9414: Oh, you were at the chateau.${prompt}
  9415: Hold it right there! You're the scoundrel who made off with the scepter--admit it!${prompt}
  9416: Young man, do you know of the esteemed personages of King Raigegue and Prince Fellenant?${prompt}
  9417: |-
    Huh? Well, yes.
    They were of the royal family of San d'Oria two hundred years ago. It was their struggle for control of the Kingdom that caused the civil war before the time of King Ranperre.${prompt}
  9418: |-
    You are certain!?
    Then the internal strife began...${prompt}
  9419: Hmm, that would have been several years after our crushing defeat at the Second Battle of Konschtat.${prompt}
  9420: Prince Fellenant recruited the Temple Knights to his cause and took control of the city. He then declared his intention to forge a peace with Bastok.${prompt}
  9421: However, his older brother, King Raigegue, could not forgive his younger sibling's actions; this call for peace had come right at the height of the king's efforts to rally the remaining Royal Knights for a counterattack against the Republic.${prompt}
  9422: What of Vijartal Caphieux!?${prompt}
  9423: |-
    Do you truly not know?
    He is one of the foremost heroes in our kingdom's history. It was during the time of civil war that Vijartal Caphieux rose to prominence through his valorous actions. Why, I shouldn't think the smallest child in San d'Oria would be unaware of his deeds.${prompt}
  9424: You jest with me...surely? Is this, then, the world of the future? What a ridiculous notion...${prompt}
  9425: What an odd character. Well, never mind. What I should be focusing on now is the capture of that rogue and the retrieval of the Scepter Royaulais.${prompt}
  9426: |-
    That's it!
    Do you remember the lady that introduced herself as Phillone? I think her story bears further investigation, but I cannot leave my post.${prompt}
  9427: Could you go and find out more about her as a favor to me? I must solve this crime if I'm ever to be noticed by my superiors. Please let me know if you discover anything important.${prompt}
  9428: Could you go and find out more about the lady who calls herself Phillone? I must solve this crime if I'm ever to be noticed by my superiors. Please let me know if you discover anything important.${prompt}
  9429: You...you're the adventurer I talked to before! What happened to the man they caught? Was he unharmed!?${prompt}
  9430: What? He wasn't the thief they were looking for?${prompt}
  9431: Naphee, it's you!${prompt}
  9432: |-
    What a relief...
    I'm so glad you're here! This isn't some future world after all!${prompt}
  9433: My pardon, sir, but I don't believe we've met...${prompt}
  9434: I've had the most trying day. Tedious nonsense from the people at the chateau, all this talk about me being some sort of hero...${prompt}
  9435: My bones are in need of a rest, dear Naphee. I think I'll take a short nap, if you don't mind.${prompt}
  9436: Just a moment! Who are you, sir? You don't just go barging into people's homes as you please!${prompt}
  9437: What are you babbling about, Naphee?${prompt}
  9438: Naphee? My name is Phillone!${prompt}
  9439: I'm not in the mood for these games, especially not in my own house. I expect more from my one and only love.${prompt}
  9440: |-
    Your love!?
    What in Altana's name are you on about!? Leave at once or I shall call upon the Temple Knights!${prompt}
  9441: |-
    Phillone?
    What's wrong? You're all flushed.${prompt}
  9442: |-
    A Hume...and that accent...
    You can't possibly be a Bastoker!?${prompt}
  9443: Well, yes, I am.${prompt}
  9444: You've got some nerve setting foot in the holy city of San d'Oria! Or perhaps you've escaped from your prison cell!?${prompt}
  9445: This is my home. Have I done something wrong that I'm not aware of?${prompt}
  9446: |-
    I don't understand...
    My mind must be playing tricks on me...${prompt}
  9447: This is my home, is it not? And yet I find some filthy Bastoker living here with a woman who should be my darling Naphee.${prompt}
  9448: Where on Vana'diel is this place? Have I truly been catapulted into the future?${prompt}
  9449: "Who was that man? \nAnd why do I feel like I've met him somewhere before...?${prompt}"
  9450: You are an adventurer, are you? And you're looking for the thief of the Scepter Royaulais?${prompt}
  9451: I have a favor to ask.${prompt}
  9452: I need your help in retrieving the stolen scepter.${prompt}
  9453: You see, the person who stole the Scepter Royaulais was actually my younger brother, Millechairale.${prompt}
  9454: Forgive my rash words before, adventurer. I'd believed it was Millechairale who had been captured.${prompt}
  9455: There is a legend that tells of a mysterious power being attributed to the Pierre Errante, the gem that graces the tip of the Scepter Royaulais. This is why it has been handed down through generations of San d'Orian kings and become a symbol of our country in its own right.${prompt}
  9456: And that is what Millechairale has gone and stolen...${prompt}
  9457: But my brother is no common thief! He has no evil purpose in his heart. I beg you, please help Millechairale...${prompt}
  9458: Fearing for his own safety, Millechairale hid the Scepter Royaulais somewhere. It is my plan to find that hiding place and return the scepter to the chateau before he has a chance to reclaim it.${prompt}
  9459: By doing this, perhaps the knights won't be so hard on Millechairale if they do happen to catch him. Maybe they'll even give up on their investigation when the royal treasure is restored to its rightful place.${prompt}
  9460: But the request of our ancestor...${prompt}
  9461: Phillone. I understand how you feel, but the safety of your brother is more important.${prompt}
  9462: I...I know you're right, but...${prompt}
  9463: The only problem is, the place I need to get to is teeming with monsters. I don't think I can make it without the help of a seasoned knight...${prompt}
  9464: Would you happen to know any trustworthy knights who might aid me in this endeavor?${prompt}
  9465: Adventurer, please help my family...${prompt}
  9466: Time is running short.${prompt}
  9467: Please, ${name-player}. Find a knight of caliber to save my family from this looming disaster!${prompt}
  9468: So, did you discover anything important?${prompt}
  9469: Adventurer, I need to find a seasoned knight. I'm sorry, but this man is not exactly...${prompt}
  9470: What's all this about?${prompt}
  9471: Oh, if it isn't the very same gentlemen I was speaking with earlier.${prompt}
  9472: You seem perplexed. Hm? You're looking for a competent knight? Well, look no further, I know the perfect man to deal with any situation.${prompt}
  9473: You do!? Where can we find this person?${prompt}
  9474: I am Vijartal Caphieux, knight extraordinaire of the illustrious Caphieux family! Ancient hero of San d'Oria in the world of the future!${prompt}
  9475: I think his sword belt is on a little tight...${prompt}
  9476: A knight, be he of the past or future, must not be unsettled by trivial matters. In this world, I am a renowned hero. What say you, are you not impressed?${prompt}
  9477: |-
    I must think of a more fitting name for myself.
    What do you think of “Thunderbringer Vijartal”? Has a little more punch to it.${prompt}
  9478: |-
    Hmmm, there must be something better, though...
    I have it! How about “Vijartal Caphieux, the Obsidian Bolt”? Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?${prompt}
  9479: Vijartal Caphieux?${prompt}
  9480: |-
    The Obsidian Bolt...
    Yes, I like it! Give me some time to work on a new signature.${prompt}
  9481: Excuse me, might I have a word with you? We can speak at my house.${prompt}
  9482: I see. Your tale is a sorry one. But why should I be the one to help your brother?${prompt}
  9483: Well, since you introduced yourself as Vijartal Caphieux, the famed knight, I figured you must be a skilled warrior. Your assistance would be most welcome.${prompt}
  9484: As I am most certain it would be. However, no matter how great my ability may be, there are many preparations I must make. My sword is in need of repair, and there are several other things...${prompt}
  9485: Seeing as your name is the same as our ancient hero, the Temple Knights might let you off lightly, even if you are caught helping us.${prompt}
  9486: Naphee, always with that tone of voice...${prompt}
  9487: My name is Phillone.${prompt}
  9488: You and she are so very similar.${prompt}
  9489: Very well, then. I will help you. All we need to do is retrieve the Scepter Royaulais, correct? A knight is bound to aid those weaker than himself. That is what I always... Ah, never mind.${prompt}
  9490: You'll help us!? Thank you, we will never forget this for the rest of our...${prompt}
  9491: However, I do not trust Bastokers.${prompt}
  9492: What?${prompt}
  9493: The people of Bastok are vulgar and uncouth, and should be despised by any upstanding citizen of noble San d'Oria. I will not suffer to be lumped in with the likes of him.${prompt}
  9494: |-
    I beg your pardon!
    There is no such enmity between the people of San d'Oria and Bastok! Apologize to Roido at once!${prompt}
  9495: Again, your resemblance to my Naphee is uncanny.${prompt}
  9496: You don't need to pretend to like me, but I cannot go to that place alone. It's far too dangerous.${prompt}
  9497: Dangerous!? Are there fiends and the like in this place?${prompt}
  9498: Without a doubt. Knowing Millechairale, he has hidden the scepter somewhere in the vast forest that lies beyond King Ranperre's Tomb.${prompt}
  9499: Then I suppose I must accompany you. But listen well, Bastoker! You do not speak to me, understood?${prompt}
  9500: Ah... Do you think you could come along? I'm not sure if I can really trust that man...${prompt}
  9501: My brother has hidden the scepter somewhere in the vast forest that lies beyond King Ranperre's Tomb. Please find it before he returns there!${prompt}
  9502: That lady had nothing to do with the theft? Hmm, it seems my instincts were well off the mark. Perhaps my only road to greatness lies through the diligent performance of my guard duties...${prompt}
  9503: So, Millechairale has the Scepter Royaulais...${prompt}
  9504: "That one was always far too dedicated! \nWhatever am I to do?${prompt}"
  9505: '...${prompt}'
  9506: I stole into the royal book vault and read the documents that pertained to me. What Roido said was true.${prompt}
  9507: It would seem that after the incident...I am to die.${prompt}
  9508: What...?${prompt}
  9509: My family, the Caphieux family, has a bloodline that stretches back to the founding of the Kingdom. That is why I was chosen as the envoy to meet with Prince Fellenant. I was entrusted with the Scepter Royaulais and the message of the king's abdication...${prompt}
  9510: This was nothing more than a charade. My true mission was to bide my time and wait for an opportunity to assassinate the prince.${prompt}
  9511: Right at this moment...or what would be this moment in the past, the Cardinal Stags should be making their way towards the capital, bearing the Scepter Royaulais. One of them will surely carry out the assassination in my place.${prompt}
  9512: Tell me, adventurer! What in Altana's name happened in the world of my time? Why must I disobey my king's orders and put my very life in jeopardy to protect Prince Fellenant?${prompt}
  9513: |-
    Phillone!
    The Temple Knights have picked up Millechairale's trail!${prompt}
  9514: '!!!${prompt}'
  9515: They haven't caught him yet, but you can bet that he's headed for Ordelle's Caves to carry out his oath.${prompt}
  9516: Why would he...? He's walking right into their hands!${prompt}
  9517: Please, lend me your aid once more! Millechairale's life depends on it!${prompt}
  9518: No, I don't think I will.${prompt}
  9519: What?${prompt}
  9520: Why should I listen to the pleas of a Bastoker?${prompt}
  9521: Just one moment, sir! Are you insulting my husband again...?${prompt}
  9522: Vijartal, why do you despise Bastokers so much?${prompt}
  9523: My father was killed by Bastokers and their underhanded tactics in the Second Battle of Konschtat! And my older brother returned from his attempt to avenge his death a mutilated corpse!${prompt}
  9524: Bastok is the hated enemy of San d'Oria! That Republic is responsible for the deaths of everyone I held dear!${prompt}
  9525: "You say that hero wished for peace among our nations!? Preposterous! \nI...Vijartal Caphieux would rather die than aid Bastok...${prompt}"
  9526: Do you think it was any different for the people of Bastok!?${prompt}
  9527: I don't...?${prompt}
  9528: Up until a mere few decades past, the nations of San d'Oria and Bastok had fought countless battles over land, resources, and religion.${prompt}
  9529: Both San d'Orians and Bastokers lost friends and family. Many have lost people dear to them...${prompt}
  9530: '...${prompt}'
  9531: Do you not find it strange? We are all the children of Altana, and yet there is hostility and conflict among us...${prompt}
  9532: What we should really despise is war itself, not the people who are drawn into its flames. I thank Altana from the depths of my soul that we live in an age where war between the people of Vana'diel is a thing of the past.${prompt}
  9533: We must go now if we are to save Millechairale. I don't know how much time we have.${prompt}
  9534: I am going with you!${prompt}
  9535: Phillone, I need you to stay here. If the Temple Knights decide to send reinforcements, try and stall them any way you can.${prompt}
  9536: I'll do my best.${prompt}
  9537: I'm going on ahead. Meet me at the entrance to Ordelle's Caves as soon as you can. If those soldiers catch up to him...${prompt}
  9538: Please, get my brother out of there safely!${prompt}
  9539: You are an unusual woman.${prompt}
  9540: I'm sorry?${prompt}
  9541: "My lady's name, the one you so resemble, is Naphee. \nShe once asked me a question:${prompt}"
  9542: Why must the people of San d'Oria and Bastok despise each other even though we are all the children of Altana?${prompt}
  9543: The year before last, we left Bastok to settle here in the capital. The two nations are not so different, you know. All people have the same hopes, the same dreams...${prompt}
  9544: There were those who saw the Elvaan as a hated enemy, but there were also kind and caring souls such as Roido, who treated me like a person...${prompt}
  9545: It will take time, but I believe that if we continue to chip away at the barriers of prejudice and ignorance that stand between us, we will eventually come to understand each other.${prompt}
  9546: You too, Vijartal, can find peace...just as Roido and I have.${prompt}
  9547: Why this fate... If only our ancestor had not left his request for the Scepter Royaulais to be brought to Ordelle's Caves...! Altana, keep my family from harm!${prompt}
  9548: This can't be happening! Millechairale has been captured!?${prompt}
  9549: I am sorry. I have failed you...${prompt}
  9550: Monarlais Halver?${prompt}
  9551: Roido! Phillone!${prompt}
  9552: Millechairale! Why have they brought you here!?${prompt}
  9553: It is a miracle! That man who called himself Vijartal was the actual hero of legend!${prompt}
  9554: A sealed letter with orders to be opened this year has been passed down through the royal family. It is a document written by Prince Fellenant, the man saved by Vijartal Caphieux.${prompt}
  9555: That document is about your family.${prompt}
  9556: Unbelievable!${prompt}
  9557: According to this letter, Millechairale Caphieux would steal the Scepter Royaulais. However, he and those who accompanied him are not to be charged with any crime, as requested by Vijartal Caphieux...${prompt}
  9558: It was written that these people would sustain the good relations between our kingdom and Bastok, as well as play a vital role in the future of San d'Oria.${prompt}
  9559: '!!!${prompt}'
  9560: It is a most unusual document. But the will of Prince Fellenant, a direct ancestor of the current d'Oraguille royal family, is incontestable.${prompt}
  9561: While we are on the subject, are you aware of the legend that surrounds the Pierre Errante?${prompt}
  9562: Vijartal Caphieux convinced Fellenant to reopen the city after preventing the prince's assassination. It is said that in that moment, Prince Fellenant gazed into the Pierre Errante and saw a glimpse of the future.${prompt}
  9563: It is not exactly certain what vision the prince beheld. Only that nations that were once at war would join hands in the spirit of cooperation. After seeing this dream of the future, Prince Fellenant surrendered to his brother, the king.${prompt}
  9564: This surrender was under the condition that the Temple Knights, who had acted under the prince's orders to take control of the capital, be held free of responsibility. Also, a treaty calling for the cessation of hostilities with Bastok was to be ratified.${prompt}
  9565: And what became of Vijartal Caphieux? Well, that is a tale known by any child of the Kingdom. He was fatally poisoned while grappling with the assassin intent on taking the prince's life...${prompt}
  9566: The strangest thing is that the true grave of Vijartal has never been found. With the deeds he performed, I am sure he was interred in a suitably resplendent tomb, however.${prompt}
  9567: In any case, after his surrender, Prince Fellenant was imprisoned in the oubliette. It was an official stance that the blood of the royal family was not to be spilled, no matter the crime.${prompt}
  9568: Three years after his imprisonment, the prince managed to escape. As we all know, this sparked the beginning of the grueling civil war that scarred one hundred years of San d'Orian history.${prompt}
  9569: This internal conflict persisted until the Dragon King, Ranperre, took the throne and united the Elvaan people once again. In his veins flowed the same blood as Prince Fellenant.${prompt}
  9570: I must apologize. It was not my intention to give such a protracted history lesson.${prompt}
  9571: Rather, I was quite surprised to hear that the line of Vijartal Caphieux still flourished in the capital.${prompt}
  9572: Until recently, we had been residing in the city of Bastok.${prompt}
  9573: In Bastok?${prompt}
  9574: Yes, our family has been there for several generations...${prompt}
  9575: Hmm... Come to think of it, there is literature that tells of a knight who organized Prince Fellenant's escape, and who later took refuge in Bastok.${prompt}
  9576: Apparently, this knight signed his name as the “Obsidian Bolt.”${prompt}
  9577: Would you know anything about this?${prompt}
  9578: Actually, perhaps it would be best not to breach that subject. If I started on the convoluted history of our kingdom, the moon could pass though its cycle and I would still have only scratched the surface.${prompt}
  9579: What's that you say? You have met with the hero of this tale? Hahaha, now you are poking fun at me!${prompt}
  9580: |-
    It is time I returned to my duties.
    Phillone. They will be released in due time, but for a while Roido and Millechairale's presence will be required at the chateau.${prompt}
  9581: There are too many details of this case that remain unclear to me. I should like to listen to a full explanation of these goings-on, as well as hear more about your ancestors...${prompt}
  9582: Do not worry for us, dear sister. I am sure we will be back before you know it.${prompt}
  9583: Yes, and then we can continue our peaceful life here, in this house of Vijartal Caphieux...${prompt}
  9584: I await your return.${prompt}
  9585: "Was that man really our...\nNo, it isn't possible. \nNow, I must get used to this quiet house without those two around to liven things up!${prompt}"
  9586: Intruders!${prompt}
  9587: '...Is something I''ve always wanted to say, but having “nothing to report” day in, day out is probably for the best, all things considered. Still, it must have been exciting to live in the same age as Vijartal Caphieux...${prompt}'
  9588: Vous dites avoir rencontré Louverance ? Comment allait ce jeune homme ?${prompt}
  9589: |-
    Je vois… Il vient si rarement, ces temps-ci.
    Je suis si inquiète. Si quelque chose lui arrivait, mon défunt mari en serait anéanti.${prompt}
  9590: |-
    Hm ?
    L’Expédition Multinationale ? Voilà un nom que je n’avais pas entendu depuis trente ans…${prompt}
  9591: |-
    Oui, je m’en souviens comme si c’était hier…
    À l’époque, mon mari et moi vivions dans un manoir juste à l’extérieur du village de La Vaule… enfin, je crois qu’on appelle cet endroit Davoi, maintenant.${prompt}
  9592: Il y avait un monastère au centre du village. Lorsque Muchavatte, le papsque de l’époque, rendait visite au monastère, il s’arrêtait souvent chez nous.${prompt}
  9593: Je me souviens que Sa Sainteté disait que l’expédition avait été envoyée pour vérifier certaines informations transmises par le gouvernement de Bastok.${prompt}
  9594: À cette époque, les Humes prétendaient qu’une force puissante était cachée quelque part dans les Terres Interdites du Nord.${prompt}
  9595: Bien sûr, le papsque ne pouvait se fier entièrement aux histoires de ces sournois de Bastok.${prompt}
  9596: Mais c’est mon mari qui a suggéré que cette force mystérieuse pourrait être liée aux Portes du Paradis…${prompt}
  9597: Dame Hinaree ! Voulez-vous dire que la cathédrale avait localisé les portes ?${prompt}
  9598: Oh… !${prompt}
  9599: Oh, comme notre petite invitée de Tavnazia a grandi ! Et regarde-moi un peu ça, tu es devenue si belle !${prompt}
  9600: Je peux supposer que cet aventurier est une de tes connaissances ?${prompt}
  9601: Je m’excuse pour cette intrusion, Dame Hinaree. Quand j’ai entendu parler des Portes du Paradis, je n’ai pas pu me retenir…${prompt} 
  9602: Ce n’est rien, mon enfant. Je suis simplement submergée par l’émotion. Je n’aurais jamais imaginé que nous nous reverrions. Cela fait bien vingt ans, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9603: Oui… Et je dois encore une fois vous exprimer toute ma gratitude pour la gentillesse que vous m’avez témoignée à l’époque.${prompt}
  9604: Oh, voyons, une telle humilité n’est pas nécessaire. D’après Mildaurion C Giloumet, tu étais une invitée très spéciale.${prompt}
  9605: 'Je me souviens encore de ses mots : « Veuillez accueillir chez vous la célèbre ménestrelle, Dame Ulmia. »${prompt}'
  9606: |-
    <Rire>
    Tu étais encore si jeune… Je me demandais bien comment et quand tu étais devenue “célèbre”. C’est alors que tu m’as dit voyager avec le cardinal parce que tu voulais découvrir Vana’diel.${prompt}
  9607: Encore désolée…${prompt}
  9608: |-
    Oui, maintenant que j’y pense…
    N’y avait-il pas une autre jeune fille avec toi ?${prompt}
  9609: …${prompt}
  9610: Oh, je suis désolée… Je n’y ai pas réfléchi… Je ne savais pas que…${prompt}
  9611: Non, ce n’est rien. Elle est toujours en vie. Elle a réussi à s’échapper des flammes de la guerre avec moi.${prompt}
  9612: Oh, quel soulagement d’apprendre qu’une autre enfant de Vana’diel a été bénie par la lumière de la Déesse de l’Aube.${prompt}
  9613: Oui… Les choses étaient tellement meilleures il y a trente ans, lorsque Muchavatte et Mildaurion étaient encore parmi nous…${prompt}
  9614: Ils s’installaient dans le bureau avec mon mari et discutaient jusqu’au petit matin, débattant de l’existence des Portes du Paradis.${prompt}
  9615: Dame Hinaree, puis-je me permettre de vous demander ce que vous savez des portes ?${prompt}
  9616: La raison de ma venue depuis Tavnazia est justement d’interroger la cathédrale à ce sujet.${prompt}
  9617: …${prompt}
  9618: L’explication donnée au peuple était plus vague et trompeuse que n’importe lequel de mes cantiques.${prompt}
  9619: J’ai entendu dire qu’il s’agissait d’un message d’Altana, confié au papsque sur son lit de mort. Mais j’ai aussi entendu bien des récits qui contredisent cela.${prompt}
  9620: Je vous en prie… Dites-moi s’il y a autre chose derrière cette histoire.${prompt}
  9621: Ulmia… Le Paradis est un endroit magnifique, un lieu sans mort ni peur.${prompt}
  9622: Quand mon village a été attaqué par les Orcs, les mains ensanglantées du destin m’ont arraché mon mari. La foi en ce Paradis que le papsque m’a transmise… C’est ce qui m’a sauvée.${prompt}
  9623: Tu chantes les mots du cœur, Ulmia. Tu sais pourtant que la vérité ne nous sauve pas toujours.${prompt}
  9624: Mais si elle est la seule à pouvoir nous offrir le salut, alors rien n’est plus précieux.${prompt}
  9625: Le cardinal Mildaurion m’a dit que le courage d’affronter la vérité est ce qui nous sauvera, au final.${prompt}
  9626: Le cardinal t’a dit cela… ?${prompt}
  9627: |-
    Très bien…
    Il y a une chose que Sa Sainteté m’a confiée lorsque je lui ai rendu visite après qu’il soit tombé malade.${prompt}
  9628: « J’ai été contraint d’abandonner la vérité. »${prompt}
  9629: Abandonner… la vérité ?${prompt}
  9630: L’expression sur son visage quand il m’a dit cela était celle d’un homme déjà aux portes de l’au-delà. Je n’ai pas eu le courage de lui demander ce qu’il entendait par là.${prompt}
  9631: …${prompt}
  9632: Je ne peux pas dire si la « vérité » dont parlait le papsque avait un quelconque lien avec les Portes du Paradis.${prompt}
  9633: Cependant, peu après cette rencontre, le cardinal Mildaurion a renoncé à son titre de noblesse et a disparu du Royaume. Avec le recul, cet événement pourrait bien être lié aux paroles de Muchavatte.${prompt}
  9634: Le cardinal a renoncé à sa noblesse ? Quand cela s’est-il produit ?${prompt}
  9635: Il y a presque vingt ans, bien sûr. Je crois que c’était quelques jours seulement après l’attaque surprise des Orcs contre le Marquisat. Tu n’étais pas au courant ?${prompt}
  9636: Non, je ne l’étais pas. J’ai toujours cru que le cardinal Mildaurion avait péri lors de l’assaut. La dernière fois que je l’ai vue, elle se trouvait à Tavnazia, alors que tout s’effondrait et brûlait.${prompt}
  9637: Il semblerait que la lumière d’Altana ait également protégé le cardinal.${prompt}
  9638: |-
    Oui… On dirait bien…
    Dame Hinaree, sauriez-vous où elle est allée après avoir renoncé à sa noblesse ?${prompt}
  9639: Non, je l’ignore. Mais j’ai entendu dire que la cathédrale avait envoyé un chevalier enquêter sur sa disparition.${prompt}
  9640: Ce chevalier s’appelle Louverance… Il est l’un des descendants directs des anciens Chevaliers Mistalle. Je dis “anciens” car leur lignée a perdu ses titres royaux il y a bien des années. On raconte que Louverance lui-même a fait partie des Chevaliers Royaux.${prompt}
  9641: Abandonner la vérité…${prompt}
  9642: Cette vérité est-elle liée aux Portes du Paradis, ou est-ce encore autre chose ? La vérité sur l’expédition, peut-être ?${prompt}
  9643: |-
    Et le cardinal Mildaurion… J’ignorais totalement qu’elle était encore en vie.
    Mais si c’est vrai, pourquoi n’est-elle pas revenue à Tavnazia ?${prompt}
  9644: Nous aurait-elle oubliés… oubliée, moi ?${prompt}
  9645: Je me souviens que Sa Sainteté disait que l’expédition avait été envoyée pour vérifier certaines informations transmises par le gouvernement de Bastok.${prompt}
  9646: |-
    Cependant, tu pourrais essayer d’enquêter à Windurst.
    Cette affaire reste entourée de bien des mystères…${prompt}
  9647: Mais, laissant de côté ces pensées troublantes, cette réunion d’aujourd’hui fut une merveilleuse surprise. Nous devons remercier la douce Altana pour cette bénédiction.${prompt}
  9648: Hm ? Vous cherchez Louverance N Mistalle ?${prompt}
  9649: Cela pourrait être plus difficile que vous ne l’imaginez. Mais si vous êtes béni par la lumière d’Altana, rien n’est impossible.${prompt}
  9650: |-
    Ah, c’est vous, l’aventurier qui est passé ici plus tôt.
    Avez-vous trouvé Prishe ?${prompt}
  9651: |-
    Je vois…
    Ulmia m’a raconté ce qui s’est passé.${prompt}
  9652: C’est inquiétant d’apprendre que Prishe, malgré son état de santé, est mêlée à tout cela. Et voilà qu’Ulmia me dit qu’elle a disparu et que le gouvernement de Jeuno a lancé un mandat d’arrêt contre elle.${prompt}
  9653: ${name-player}, vous connaissez Prishe, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  9654: Même si je ne l’ai rencontrée qu’une seule fois, il y a bien longtemps, je ne peux pas croire qu’elle soit capable des actes dont le Duché l’accuse.${prompt}
  9655: Ce n’est peut-être qu’une inquiétude inutile, mais il y a quelque chose qui me trouble.${prompt}
  9656: Quand le cardinal Mildaurion est venue chez nous avec son élève, Prishe, mon mari m’a dit de me méfier d’elle…${prompt}
  9657: Quand je lui ai demandé pourquoi, il m’a dit que sa naissance était un grand malheur, et que le moment venu, elle commettrait un terrible crime contre Vana’diel et ses enfants… que telle était sa destinée.${prompt}
  9658: Et c’est tout ce qu’il a voulu dire…${prompt}
  9659: Oh, ne vous en faites pas, ${name-player}. J’ai renoncé à tout intérêt personnel et j’ai voué ma vie à la Déesse de l’Aube.${prompt}
  9660: Peu m’importe le passé d’une personne ou les crimes qu’elle a pu commettre. Je ne peux pas tourner le dos à quelqu’un qui me demande de l’aide.${prompt}
  9661: J’ai proposé mon aide à Ulmia dans cette période difficile. Je lui ai aussi suggéré de rester ici.${prompt}
  9662: Je vous en prie, pourriez-vous lui transmettre un message important ?${prompt}
  9663: Il y a quelques instants, un grand prêtre de la cathédrale, Chasalvige, est passé. Il souhaitait parler à Ulmia.${prompt}
  9664: Je crois qu’elle se trouve quelque part près du port. Je vous serais extrêmement reconnaissante si vous pouviez la retrouver et lui demander de se rendre à la cathédrale.${prompt}
  9665: Ulmia se rend au port chaque jour pour demander aux voyageurs s’ils ont des nouvelles de Prishe.${prompt}
  9666: Auriez-vous l’amabilité de la retrouver et de lui dire de se présenter au Grand Prêtre Chasalvige à la cathédrale ?${prompt}

  9722: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  9723: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  9724: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  9725: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  9726: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  9727: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  9728: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  9729: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  9730: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  9731: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  9732: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  9733: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  9734: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  9735: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  9736: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  9737: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  9738: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  9739: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  9740: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  9741: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  9742: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'
  9743: 'However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}'
  9744: '${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}'
  9745: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
  9746: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  9747: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  9748: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
  9749: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}

    Thus I was impelled to seek the aid of an adventurer...${prompt}
  9771: If word of my request reaches the wrong ears, it may place my family in danger.${prompt}
  9772: Should you decide to take up my request, would you be willing to swear a blood oath?${prompt}
  9773: You must swear to Altana, Goddess of the Dawn, to breathe not a single syllable of this matter to anyone...${prompt}
  9774: |-
    Do you swear?
    ${selection-lines}
    On my honor.
    Only when I hurt myself...${prompt}
  9775: |-
    My thanks.
    As proof of your oath, I ask that you bring me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}
  9776: My family's fate is in your hands.${prompt}
  9777: |-
    I see.
    It was foolish of me to expect an adventurer to accept such a binding agreement. I will think of some other way...${prompt}
  9778: 'As proof of your oath, I ask that you bring me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  9779: |-
    Thank you, adventurer.
    I accept this ${item-singular: 1[2]} as proof of your word.${prompt}
  9780: |-
    I once again insist that you breathe not a word of this to anyone.
    Now, to the matter at hand.${prompt}
  9781: Several days ago, Count Varonbiriaux M Teulomme was granted audience with the royaulais.${prompt}
  9782: |-
    Do you know of Count Teulomme?
    He resides in a mansion built within the Carpenters' Landing territory.${prompt}
  9783: Thirty years ago, those lands belonged to the Knights Mistalle.${prompt}
  9784: However, the head of the family, Francmage M Mistalle, lost his life under mysterious circumstances...${prompt}
  9785: His inexplicable death dealt a terrible blow to the knights.${prompt}
  9786: Francmage's only son and member of the Royal Knights, Leservieus M Mistalle, was swept up in a whirlwind of rage and despair.${prompt}
  9787: |-
    He became embroiled in an argument with Lord Epuliphont, a Temple Knight with whom he was not on good terms.
    Enraged by the slanderous conjecture on his father's fate, Leservieus challenged Epuliphont to a duel to the death.${prompt}
  9788: As has always been the case in San d'Oria, duels are strictly forbidden by law.${prompt}
  9789: When word of their battle reached the royal court, both families were stripped of their titles, and Leservieus's wife returned to Selbina with her infant child in tow.${prompt}
  9790: Thirty years have passed since that time.${prompt}
  9791: The son born to Leservieus and his wife grew up to become a magnificent knight.${prompt}
  9792: He has embarked on a journey to redeem his family's name.${prompt}
  9793: When Count Teulomme learned of this, he ordered his vassals to search for this heir to the Knights Mistalle.${prompt}
  9794: The count, under the pretext of wishing to know the truth of what happened thirty years ago, is offering to assist the knight in his endeavor...${prompt}
  9795: However, the count's cook believes that Teulomme is more concerned with losing his lands to their rightful owner.${prompt}
  9796: |-
    Please do not take a cook's words lightly.
    Much information reaches a man who prepares the meals for a household.${prompt}
  9797: If Count Teulomme is truly seeking to cause harm to the heir of the Knights Mistalle, we have a duty to warn him of the danger.${prompt}
  9798: I am certain an adventurer of your caliber will be able to locate this man before anything untoward occurs.${prompt}
  9799: Please find the knight of Mistalle. He must know of the threat to his life.${prompt}
  9800: Is Count Teulomme truly searching for the knight of Mistalle to cause him harm?${prompt}
  9801: I ask that you find this knight and warn him of the danger he is in.${prompt}
  9802: I know not where he presently resides...${prompt}
  9803: But it is possible his mother, the Lady Leffine, yet abides in the town of Selbina.${prompt}
  9804: Atarefaunet's Band!?${prompt}
  9805: That is a frightening name indeed.${prompt}
  9806: That despicable group of brigands terrorized the length and breadth of the Quon continent when I was a child.${prompt}
  9807: They would prowl the trade routes between San d'Oria, Bastok, Jeuno, and Tavnazia, and attack any merchants they came across.${prompt}
  9808: |-
    They showed no mercy to man, woman, or child, and used the goods and information they obtained to threaten and blackmail others.
    They were far worse than a mere gang of thieves.${prompt}
  9809: But near the end of the Great War, their leader--Atarefaunet--was finally caught by bounty hunters.${prompt}
  9810: Atarefaunet was brought here to San d'Oria and executed soon after.${prompt}
  9811: The remaining members of the band scattered to the corners of Vana'diel, and are still in hiding to this day.${prompt}
  9812: Could it be possible that Count Teulomme has employed members of Atarefaunet's Band?${prompt}
  9813: And these villains are searching for Lady Leffine's son, Louverance...${prompt}
  9814: |-
    Things are far worse than I feared.
    Hearing of the involvement of Atarefaunet's Band fills me with dread.${prompt}
  9815: |-
    Here is your reward.
    I beg of you, adventurer, do not speak a word of this to anyone.${prompt}
  9816: |-
    Stay on your guard, ${name-player}.
    And please, do not speak a word of this to anyone.${prompt}
  9817: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Your timing is most fortunate.${prompt}
  9818: My husband has something he wishes to discuss with you.${prompt}
  9819: You are the adventurer who carried out my wife's request?${prompt}
  9820: She seems to hold you in high regard, but do you truly have the skills required to live up to that trust?${prompt}
  9821: You would do well not to sign an oath in blood so lightly.${prompt}
  9822: The blood oath signed by the families of Mistalle and Revemel served as evidence of their duel when the case was brought before the royal court.${prompt}
  9823: Both families were severely punished for their actions.${prompt}
  9824: This matter does not concern me personally. However, my wife's mother, who worked for the Revemel family, was accused of handing over that oath.${prompt}
  9825: My mother is innocent of this charge, but her pleas fell on deaf ears.${prompt}
  9826: Now perhaps you see why Sobane is so adamant in her pursuit of the truth.${prompt}
  9827: |-
    Although I may be the head chef for the royal family, I am still naught but a simple cook.
    I have no interest in raising knights and joining the noble families' struggle for power.${prompt}
  9828: Whatever underhanded deals were made or plans hatched, it is all in the past.${prompt}
  9829: There is nothing to be gained by staring at an empty plate once the food has been eaten.${prompt}
  9830: I understand what you wish to say, dearest.${prompt}
  9831: However, we must take responsibility for the future.${prompt}
  9832: Louverance Mistalle must be warned of the threat to his life...${prompt}
  9833: Even though you have never met the knight in question?${prompt}
  9834: As the chef for the Teulomme family tells it, the count is facing threats from some unknown personage.${prompt}
  9835: |-
    For all we know, it could be this Louverance you seek to protect.
    Count Teulomme would then be well justified in his efforts to track him down.${prompt}
  9836: Louverance was raised in the town of Selbina, and has received no formal knightly training.${prompt}
  9837: After reaching manhood, he traveled to San d'Oria with great prospects of joining the Royal Knights. His decision to give up this chance does not speak highly of his character.${prompt}
  9838: '...${prompt}'
  9839: But it would be a mistake to judge him based on those facts alone.${prompt}
  9840: That is why I would like you to confirm something for us, adventurer.${prompt}
  9841: Is the person threatening Count Teulomme really this Louverance, or some other character who has strayed from the knightly path?${prompt}
  9842: Apparently, the count has yet to respond to his tormentor.${prompt}
  9843: According to the chef, the criminal has said that he can be contacted through one of the Tonberries of Carpenters' Landing.${prompt}
  9844: |-
    That is all I know.
    I must return to my duties in the chateau.
    Sobane, be wary of strangers.${prompt}
  9845: Yes, dear...${prompt}
  9846: I wonder if Sir Louverance is the one threatening Count Teulomme, as my husband suggests.${prompt}
  9847: The criminal has said that he can be contacted through one of the Tonberries of Carpenters' Landing.${prompt}
  9848: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Please help me to uncover the truth.${prompt}
  9849: |-
    ${name-player}, you look exhausted.
    This request has been hard on you.${prompt}
  9850: |-
    You have discovered the identity of the one threatening Count Teulomme?
    And it was not Sir Louverance?${prompt}
  9851: You confirmed Louverance's innocence, but you were not able to learn the nature of the threats...${prompt}
  9852: Thank you for investigating this matter, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9853: |-
    I know where Louverance can be found.
    A knight returning from the Northlands brought me the tale.${prompt}
  9854: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}.
    It seems Louverance wasn't the villain after all.${prompt}
  9855: I was assured by a knight well known to me that the descendant of the Mistalle line is a splendid character who upholds the pride of his family name.${prompt}
  9856: He even went so far as to say that Louverance's actions were responsible for saving his life.${prompt}
  9857: He also promised me a letter would be composed and sent to Louverance to warn him of the potential danger from Count Teulomme.${prompt}
  9858: Does that satisfy you, Sobane?${prompt}
  9859: |-
    Yes, I believe that should be sufficient.
    Thank you, Ondieumais.${prompt}
  9860: Then I shall return to the chateau.${prompt}
  9861: |-
    I must extend my thanks to you as well, ${name-player}.
    Hopefully, Sir Louverance will now at least be aware of the threat to his life.${prompt}
  9862: Please take this as payment for your services.${prompt}
  9863: |-

    Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror?
    I would've died of fright, kupo!${prompt}
  9934: |-
    Here, take this as a testament to your courage.
    Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!${prompt}
  9935: Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!${prompt}
  9936: |-
    Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo!
    Kupupupu...${prompt}
  9937: |-
    This place is crawling with nasties.
    You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.${prompt}

    I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage.

  9940: Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?${prompt}
  9941: If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...${prompt}
  9942: Unable to enter next area. Expansion pack not installed.${prompt}
  9943: Have you seen any crazy Goblins riding around on chocobos lately, kupo?${prompt}
  9944: Oh, you don't have to worry. They probably won't attack you. They're playing a game with us moogles, kupo!${prompt}
  9945: You see, we take these cards and bury them around the outskirts of town. Then the Goblins go out and try to find them. If they do, they can bring them back to us and exchange them for different prizes, kupo.${prompt}
  9946: This time, we spread them out all over the area, thinking that the Gobs wouldn't be able to cover that much land, kupo.${prompt}
  9947: But that was before we learned that they had their own chocobos!${prompt}
  9948: It's just not fair, kupo!${prompt}
  9949: Now it's only a matter of time before those stinking beastmen find all the cards and we moogles lose the game, kupo!${prompt}
  9950: |-
    And that's why we need your help, kupo!
    Would you go out into the field and find the cards before the Goblins do?${prompt}
  9951: There is a variety of different sets. For each set you bring back safely, I'll secretly give you the present that we were going to give the Goblins, kupo!${prompt}
  9952: 'For starters, why don''t you try finding ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}? That should throw those smelly Gobs for a real spin, kupo!${prompt}'
  9953: |-
    Great! A whole set, kupo!
    Ah, I wish I could be there to see the look on those Gobs' faces when all they find is an empty hole.
    Oh, right! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt}
  9954: |-
    If you have any extra time on your hands, try finding more card sets, kupo!
    We really have to stick it to those Gobs this year to show them who's boss!${prompt}
  9955: |-
    Wow! Another set!
    You don't know how much this means to us, kupo!
    Here, take this!${prompt}
  9956: |-
    Why, ${name-player}!
    You are acquainted with the Tavnazian merchant of whom we spoke?${prompt}
  9957: |-
    What a stroke of luck, Rouva.
    You have done nothing but daydream about that merchant since the last time ${name-player} graced us with ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] presence.${prompt}
  9958: Lady Femitte! Are you implying that I...?${prompt}
  9959: |-
    But our discussion veers off course again.
    We were speaking of Despachiaire's late wife.
    What a lovely voice she had! Quite a rare talent at the time, I recall.${prompt}
  9960: |-
    She was as fair of face as she was in song...
    Though it shames me to admit it, I was rather envious of the dashing couple they made together.${prompt}
  9961: |-
    Despachiaire and his beloved were often the source of gossip among the young ladies.
    I am certain there are others who remember the pair as well as I.${prompt}
  9962: In fact, the tale of the cathedral choirgirl and the Tavnazian merchant became quite the scandal.${prompt}
  9963: After he whisked his love away to Tavnazia, I believe this...attention...prevented Despachiaire from ever returning to San d'Oria...${prompt}
  9964: 'As for this ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} you have brought to me...${prompt}'
  9965: I am not completely certain of its origin, but judging from its shape, I would guess this to be an artifact of the San d'Orian Cathedral.${prompt}
  9966: The inscription is a little difficult to make out...${prompt}
  9967: Perhaps if you polish it with the spores of the glowing mushrooms found near Carpenters' Landing, the letters will become clear enough to read...${prompt}
  9968: |-
    An elderly woman's trivial knowledge...
    Young people these days are so quick to divest themselves of anything showing signs of wear...${prompt}
  9969: If you ever find yourself in the vicinity of Carpenters' Landing, seek out one of the mushrooms I mentioned.${prompt}
  9970: |-
    I may be able to tell you more once the inscription has become readable.
    Until then, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  9971: |-
    I see you found your way to Carpenters' Landing.
    And you have done a fine job with the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.${prompt}
  9972: |-
    It is just as I supposed...
    This is an amulet made by the San d'Orian Cathedral and inscribed with the words of a famous saint.${prompt}
  9973: |-
    Ah yes, the letters are now faintly legible. Though I doubt they would be noticed by anyone unaware of their existence...
    The inscription reads:${prompt}
  9974: “Regrets wilt not plague a heart filled with faith.”${prompt}
  9975: |-
    I have heard those words before at the cathedral.
    A “heart filled with faith” referred to belief in the Goddess, however...${prompt}
  9976: Yes, I am sure the owner of this amulet applied these words to more than just religious matters.${prompt}
  9977: |-
    Oh, dear me.
    I do believe I have a touch of jealousy.
    Lady Femitte, you will lead my thoughts in such improper directions!${prompt}
  9978: Please convey my greetings to Despachiaire when you return to Tavnazia.${prompt}
  9979: |-
    Have you seen the decorations?
    The Doll Festival has started, kupo!${prompt}
  9980: I heard from my moogle sources that this is a celebration for the health and happiness of girls, kupo.${prompt}
  9981: Apparently, the young lady and her beau would play empress and emperor, and would be joined by eight of their friends for the festivities, kupo.${prompt}
  9982: |-
    Why don't you try making a ten-person party as well?
    We can all have fun celebrating the Doll Festival, kupo!${prompt}
  9983: |-
    It looks like you have all the members you need.
    Time for the festival to begin, kupo!${prompt}
  9984: |-
    After squeezing my moogle sources some more, they told me that people used to eat these during the festival.
    Here, you take one as well, kupo!${prompt}
  9985: It looks like you have all the members you need, kupo!${prompt}
  9986: In fact, the moogle grapevine tells me that this is the perfect Doll Festival combination, kupo!${prompt}
  9987: As a reward for your blind luc--I mean, “resourcefulness,” I'm going to give you lots of these treats, kupo!${prompt}
  9988: |-
    Just in case you didn't know, the three girls in your party represent ladies of the court who wait on the empress.
    Moogles know everything about festivals, kupo!${prompt}
  9989: |-
    And by the way, the five guys in your group represent musicians who entertain the empress and emperor.
    I wish I could play an instrument, kupo!${prompt}
  9990: |-
    Kupo!?
    Something's not right...
    Ah! This is a girl's festival and you don't have a girl in your party, kupo!${prompt}
  9991: |-
    Kupo...
    I know I said this was a girl's festival, but you need at least one guy to play the emperor, kupo.${prompt}
  9992: 'You obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!${prompt}'
  9993: 'You obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!${prompt}'
  9994: 'You obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}!${prompt}'
  9995: 'You obtain 3 ${item-plural: 0[2]}, 3 ${item-plural: 1[2]}, 3 ${item-plural: 2[2]}, and 3 ${item-plural: 3[2]}!${prompt}'
  9996: |-
    Kupo?
    What happened to your ten-person party?
    You can't trick presents out of me, kupo!${prompt}
  9997: |-
    Ooh, a shiny new adventurer!
    Join in the fun, kupo!${prompt}
  9998: |-
    You can only celebrate the Doll Festival once a day.
    Try again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt}
  9999: |-
    Hey!
    Your party has different members all of a sudden!
    Well, I guess I can give you this for having the right number of people at least, kupo!${prompt}
  10000: |-
    Hey!
    Your party has lost touch with its feminine side!
    You need to find yourself a lady, kupo!${prompt}
  10001: |-
    Hmm...
    You seem to have lost your male element.
    Can't have the guys running away from you, kupo!${prompt}
  10002: At the request of a certain society, I am investigating the effects of the dreaded “Emptiness” on living beings.${prompt}
  10003: |-
    You appear to be a well-traveled adventurer.
    Perhaps you have seen one of the Emptiness-ravaged creatures of which I speak?${prompt}
  10004: We have labeled these monstrosities “Empty Notorious Monsters,” or ENMs...${prompt}
  10005: |-
    Have you seen one?
    ${selection-lines}
    Indeed I have.
    I'm not quite sure...${prompt}
  10006: |-
    Aha, so you have firsthand experience.
    You probably don't need a scholar's explanation, but please indulge me...${prompt}
  10007: The material presence of ENMs has become temporary and insubstantial, meaning that those who have witnessed a particular ENM's existence are unable to encounter it again until a period of time has passed.${prompt}
  10008: |-
    My research has allowed me to measure the length of time between ENM manifestations.
    Tell me, which ENM would you like to know about?${prompt}
  10009: |-
    I wish to know about the ENM in...
    ${selection-lines}
    Nowhere in particular.
    The Spire of Holla.
    The Spire of Dem.
    The Spire of Mea.
    The Spire of Vahzl.
    Monarch Linn.
    The Shrouded Maw.
    Mine Shaft #2716.
    Bearclaw Pinnacle.
    Boneyard Gully.${prompt}
  10010: 'You won''t be able to encounter that particular ENM until ${vanatime: 1} (${earthtime: 1} Earth time).${prompt}'
  10011: The ENM in that area should be sufficiently manifest for your next encounter.${prompt}
  10012: |-
    You have no need of my expertise at the moment?
    Very well.${prompt}
  10013: And now we come to the crux of the matter...${prompt}
  10014: If there is an ENM that you are currently able to locate, I strongly urge you to take action.${prompt}
  10015: |-
    These...creatures...are no longer natural beings of Vana'diel.
    They must be destroyed.${prompt}
  10016: I cannot elaborate on the details, but know that the fate of the world depends on the early elimination of this threat...${prompt}
  10017: Then perhaps it is best if you forget this conversation entirely.${prompt}
  10018: I hope I have been of some assistance to you.${prompt}
  10019: |-
    This dark plague grows ever stronger...
    If it is not stopped soon...${prompt}
  10020: |-
    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Vicious villains are venting violently outside the city walls, kupo!${prompt}
  10021: We've divined that these creatures are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt}
  10022: |-
    But never fear!
    Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these invaders!
    Behold the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo!${prompt}
  10023: The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt}
  10024: But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!${prompt}
  10025: |-
    Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.
    Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt}
  10026: 'The ${item-singular: 0[2]} will absorb a part of the villain''s aura every time you attack, kupo.${prompt}'
  10027: Even if you don't topple the terror, bring the weapon to a moogle and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!${prompt}
  10028: |-
    By the way, these monsters are running around in samurai-style armor.
    They may be hiding among other adventurers, so be on your guard, kupo!${prompt}
  10029: |-
    Here's a new ${item-singular: 0[2]}.
    Bring it back to a moogle if you deal any damage to those samurai-styled scoundrels, kupo!${prompt}
  10030: 'If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt}'
  10031: Bring the weapon to a moogle after you've inflicted some damage to the marauding monsters and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!${prompt}
  10032: |-
    I can see the aura you've absorbed from the enemy!
    Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt}
  10033: |-
    With all the aura you've absorbed with the ${item-plural: 0[2]}, we've managed to create a new weapon.
    We'd like you to have it, kupo!${prompt}
  10034: I have been burdened with the duty of breaking the following news to all our faithful adventurers, kupo...${prompt}
  10035: After lengthy deliberation, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has decided upon the cancellation of the Feast of Swords, kupo...${prompt}
  10036: |-
    A series of scandals within MHMU's upper management in recent years has led to the--
    Kupopo!?${prompt}
  10037: The moogle appears to have received a message...!
  10038: |-
    G-grave news, kupo!!!
    Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!${prompt}
  10039: Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!${prompt}
  10040: |-
    Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer!
    Equip this ${item-singular: 0[2]}, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!${prompt}
  10041: But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt}
  10042: 'This new weapon, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies. ${prompt}'
  10043: 'We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this ${item-singular: 0[2]} near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!${prompt}'
  10044: 'To plant the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You''ll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!${prompt}'
  10045: 'When you plant the ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the ground, all malice absorbed inside will be purified by the land, kupo!${prompt}'
  10046: |-
    Alright then!
    Take this ${item-singular: 0[2]} and get to work on those vile villains! I'll be preparing your special reward, kupo!${prompt}
  10047: 'Equip this ${item-singular: 0[2]}, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it. Be sure to absorb as much malice as you can from those scoundrels, kupo!${prompt}'
  10048: |-
    Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss!
    Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.${prompt}
  10049: A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!${prompt}
  10050: Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!${prompt}
  10051: But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!${prompt}
  10052: We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!${prompt}
  10053: |-
    You have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} equipped! Great!
    Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.${prompt}
  10054: 'After you''ve taken care of the armor wearer, plant your ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the ground near the fallen fiend. You''ll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.${prompt}'
  10055: The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.${prompt}
  10056: |-
    You have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} equipped! I like your enthusiasm!
    Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.${prompt}
  10057: 'After you''ve seen to the wretched rogue inside the armor, plant your ${item-singular: 0[2]} into the ground near the fallen fiend. You''ll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.${prompt}${prompt}'
  10058: 'We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, but you need to equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you have in your possession, kupo!${prompt}'
  10059: |-
    Nooo, that ${item-singular: 0[2]} won't do.
    Come back again after you have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} equipped, kupo!${prompt}
  10060: |-
    Kupopo!
    There's no malice here at all. Please absorb lots more and try again, kupo.${prompt}
  10061: |-
    Kupopo!
    You've absorbed ${choice: 0}[a bit of/some/lots of] malice, kupo. Here's your reward!${prompt}
  10062: |-
    Thanks, kupo.
    We want you to absorb even more malice, and weaken those armored evildoers, kupo!${prompt}
  10063: 'You can purify absorbed malice by planting your ${item-singular: 0[2]} here.${prompt}'
  10064: A mysterious power absorbs the malice!${prompt}

    You must know, adventurer!

  10105: |-
    My path lies beyond the Shadow Lord and the Dark Divinity.
    The mysterious Keeper of the Apocalypse is my true opponent!${prompt}
  10106: |-
    Ah, but I have said too much.
    You must leave this ultimate blackguard to me.${prompt}
  10107: Let us meet again when the world has been made a safer place by Louverance N Mistalle!${prompt}
  10108: |-
    I must say, I feared blood would be spilled when I witnessed the hostile demeanor of that young knight.

    Oh my.
    You say that his opponent was not as fortunate?${prompt}

    Do you fear the restless dead, perhaps?

    Your lack of reaction is most disconcerting.
    Do you tire of my performance?${prompt}

  10118: |-
    When I think of the danger we faced to avert catastrophe...
    The blissful ignorance around me is somehow infuriating.${prompt}
  10119: |-
    The only things that have been disturbed here are our individual fates.
    If events had proceeded according to plan, I would have been able to receive aid from the Western Kingdom in the restoration of Tavnazia...${prompt}
  10120: However, the precious Star of Tavnazia was lost when Prishe hurled it into the face of Promathia...${prompt}
  10121: And doing anything to incur the wrath of the cardinal would be foolish, now that I know her true identity.${prompt}
  10122: In any case, I have lost interest in prying open the Gates of Paradise after seeing the land of Al'Taieu with my own eyes.${prompt}

    But all was not in vain.

    After meeting him so many times, you must be aware of the Mistalle family traits.
    A line of hotheads, would-be heroes...${prompt}

    Can you believe the man was so eager to accept a duel to the death?
    The very thing that soiled his family name to begin with...${prompt}
  10127: |-
    Hm?
    His stupidity made it possible to tie up all the loose ends with a simple “performance”?${prompt}
  10128: |-
    You are correct, my friend.
    Now all that remains is to change my name and set out on the road once more.${prompt}
  10129: With the power of the Mimeo Mirror at my disposal, I can coerce any noble with shady secrets into my service.${prompt}
  10130: I will restore the Marquisate, create a new order of knights...${prompt}
  10131: And resurrect the Remevel name.${prompt}

    Festival time, kupo～!!!
    We moogles have come up with a new game for you to enjoy called "Azimuth Circle"!${prompt}
  10146: |-
    Azimuth Circle is played in pairs!
    First, find a partner and make a party, kupo!${prompt}
  10147: After you've done that, try to find a certain checkpoint located in this town! There are many checkpoints, but only one right answer, kupo!${prompt}
  10148: However...you can only check three points, kupo! But don't worry--once you've checked a point, you can look at it again any number of times!${prompt}
  10149: At each location lies a compass that points in the direction of your partner's special checkpoint! The directions will be indicated from the viewpoint of your partner, kupo～.${prompt}
  10150: Find both of your special checkpoints and exchange the items you receive from them! Bring those items to us. We will give you a reward in exchange, kupo!${prompt}
  10151: |-
    That's all there is to it, kupo!
    To participate, make a party of two and talk to a moogle!${prompt}
  10152: |-
    That's all there is to it, kupo!
    Your partner seems to already be participating in the game.
    If you want to play together, ask your partner to cancel the current game and talk to a moogle again!${prompt}
  10153: Will you participate in Azimuth Circle with your partner, kupo?${prompt}
  10154: |-
    Play the game?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ready to go!
    I'll pass.${prompt}
  10155: When both of you are ready, talk to a moogle! Then the game will begin, kupo!${prompt}
  10156: If you decide you want to play, just come with a friend, kupo!${prompt}
  10157: Our records indicate that you are presently signed up for Azimuth Circle somewhere else, kupo. Would you like to cancel your participation there?${prompt}
  10158: |-
    Well, kupo?
    You want to stop playing Azimuth Circle?${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, freedom!
    I'll keep playing, thanks.${prompt}
  10160: |-
    Your game has been cancelled.
    If you want to try again, speak to a moogle, kupo!${prompt}

  10162: This isn't the item your partner found! We're still waiting on the item you got from your friend, kupo!${prompt}
  10163: |-
    You must wait for your partner to finish, kupo!
    Would you like to cancel the current game instead?${prompt}

  10169: Have you ever heard of Blitz Buffalo, kupo? It's a fast and frenzied buffalo-chasing fiasco ferried in from a land to the far west of Quon!${prompt}
  10170: We moogles thought it sounded like fun! So we rounded up a bunch of buffalos and set them loose in several places, kupo!${prompt}
  10171: Also, we've tied an item to each buffalo! Anyone who catches one can keep the item as a reward! It's a great opportunity for adventurers, kupo!${prompt}
  10172: But the buffalos aren't going to take a bunch of frantic adventurers chasing them lightly! You may have to knock one out before it yields its precious item, kupo!${prompt}
  10173: If you manage to lay your hands on a buffalo, you better prepare to be flung around, kupo... Kupohoho～.${prompt}
  10174: |-
    Of course, it wouldn't be too good if you ended up being the one chased either, kupo!
    Just take care, and good luck, kupo!${prompt}

  10178: Give this card to an adventurer and tell him or her to bring it to a moogle. We'll have a present waiting, kupo!${prompt}

  10279: |-
    Love is in the air!
    It's time for Valentione's Day celebrations, kupo!${prompt}
  10280: There is an amazing type of chocolate whose filling is influenced by your feelings! When chocolate halves from a boy and a girl are matched together, the resulting whole produces a wonderful taste if the couple is meant to be, kupo!${prompt}
  10281: Young men and women in this town have broken their chocolates in two, hoping to meet that “special someone”!${prompt}
  10282: We want adventurers to help each of them find their perfect match, kupo!${prompt}
  10283: 'Here''s what you should do, kupo: Take the two halves of a piece of chocolate from a Valentione Single.${prompt}'
  10284: There are four lonely guys and four forlorn girls who need your matchmaking expertise. Try talking to someone of the same gender as you, kupo!${prompt}
  10285: When they hand over their chocolate halves, the singles will give you hints about the type of person they're head-over-heels for, kupo.${prompt}
  10286: You should be able to find an adventurer of the opposite gender who is holding a chocolate half from the perfect paramour for your Valentione Single.${prompt}
  10287: Trade the right halves of the chocolates with your adventuring colleagues and try to match them with the left half you received from the Valentione Single.${prompt}
  10288: When matching the halves, the single who gave up the left half may also meet the preferences of the single who gave up the right half.${prompt}
  10289: If both the singles meet each other's preferences, you'll have a match made in heaven, kupo!${prompt}
  10290: Don't forget who you got your chocolate from! Try to do too many things at once and you'll end up confused, so we suggest you hand in the chocolate halves to a moogle one pair at a time, kupo～.${prompt}
  10291: We moogles can take your lonely pieces and make them into one whole, complete chocolate!${prompt}
  10292: Then all you have to do is return the finished chocolate to the person who gave you the original piece. One bite will tell them if they've found their perfect partner!${prompt}
  10293: After you've returned a whole chocolate to four Valentione Singles, return to a moogle and collect your reward, kupo!${prompt}
  10294: While you're playing matchmaker, you might meet someone who puts a sparkle in your eye, too. Kupohoho～!${prompt}
  10295: Or maybe you could take advantage of this romantic occasion and make a party with that special someone while you exchange chocolates, kupopopo!${prompt}

    Want to try again?

    Quit the game?

    Yes!
    No, not yet!${prompt}
  10304: |-
    Just think of all those poor singles! You'll come back and help them later, won't you, kupo?
    You should get rid of your chocolates in a subtle manner, so that you don't hurt anyone's feelings!
    ...We wouldn't want you getting a stomachache either, now would we, kupo?${prompt}
  10305: You've managed to gather complementary pieces of chocolate! Wait just a moment, now...${prompt}
  10306: '...${prompt}'

    Kupopopo～!
    What a beautiful piece of chocolate!

  10407: Then talk to an event moogle, and we'll send you both out of town, kupo!${prompt}
  10408: We've set up several checkpoints outside.${prompt}

  10411: And it couldn't be easier to use! All the adventurers have to do is sit there and wait!${prompt}
  10412: Once the compass has stabilized, it will give you a hint to help you find your partner's checkpoint, kupo.${prompt}
  10413: But be careful not to relax too much! Just sitting there staring at the clouds won't help you at all, kupo. You have to concentrate the way you do when healing your wounds!${prompt}
  10414: And keep in mind that you will only learn about your partner's checkpoint.${prompt}
  10415: So help each other out and nothing should go wrong!${prompt}
  10416: Once you reach your checkpoint, you should find something buried there that will prove that you made it! You and your partner should trade your items with each other and then hand them to a moogle, kupo!${prompt}
  10417: That's all there is to it, kupo! You'll get a prize if you succeed, so I hope you do well!${prompt}
  10418: You'll need a partner, so come back when you have one!${prompt}

    Kupopo! Congratulations!

  10434: Kupo? That's not the partner you were with before! Changing partners in the middle of the game is against the rules, kupo.${prompt}
  10435: If you want to play with a different person, you should talk to one of us moogles and start the game over!${prompt}
  10436: I can only give each person one item a day!${prompt}

    Yes, please.

    Kupopopo～!
    This is terrible!
    Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!${prompt}
  10451: As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt}
  10452: |-
    But never fear!
    Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]} and the marvelous ${item-singular: 1[2]}, kupo!${prompt}
  10453: The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt}
  10454: But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt}
  10455: |-
    And that's not all!
    This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!${prompt}
  10456: You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!${prompt}
  10457: 'That''s why we want you to plant (${color: 5}trade${color: 1}) your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or ${item-singular: 1[2]} into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment''s regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!${prompt}'
  10458: 'Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same ${color: 5}area${color: 1} for best results.${prompt}'
  10459: 'Alright. Here''s your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Now you''re ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt}'
  10460: Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!${prompt}
  10461: 'Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt}'
  10462: Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!${prompt}
  10463: We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!${prompt}
  10464: |-
    Th-that ${item-singular: 0[2]}...
    It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt}
  10465: 'Oh, just don''t forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} when you''ve defeated one!${prompt}'
  10466: 'You''ll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt}'
  10467: 'Oh, just don''t forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or your ${item-singular: 1[2]} when you''ve defeated one!${prompt}'
  10468: And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!${prompt}
  10469: 'No, no, no! That ${item-singular: 1[2]} is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and hurry back, kupo!${prompt}'
  10470: |-
    Well done!
    On to the next one, kupo!${prompt}
  10471: That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!${prompt}

    Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo!
    If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?${prompt}

  10474: I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt}
  10475: The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...${prompt}
  10476: The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.${prompt}
  10477: Kweh!!!${prompt}
  10478: Kweeeh!♪${prompt}
  10479: All seem to be in attendance, so let us begin.${prompt}
  10480: You are gathered here today to discuss the reasons for the recent changes in chocobo behavior.${prompt}
  10481: Speak for yourself. The chocobos in Bastok seem to be doing just fine.${prompt}
  10482: No problems in Windurst, either.${prompt}
  10483: This problem currently affects the nations of San d'Oria and Jeuno. It is only a matter of time before it spreads to Windurst and Bastok as well.${prompt}
  10484: What's that? This might affect Windurst? Well, what are you waiting for? Out with it, now!${prompt}
  10485: Recently, a chocobo escaped from these stables.${prompt}
  10486: I managed to find her and bring her back, but she has been acting strangely ever since.${prompt}
  10487: She often has her head in the clouds, has developed a temper, and always appears restless...${prompt}
  10488: Why, the same thing happened to a chocobo at my stable!${prompt}
  10489: The two of you should keep a closer watch on your chocobos. You have nobody to blame but yourselves.${prompt}
  10490: You're right... I never should've mentioned wild chocobos in front of him...${prompt}
  10491: Wild chocobos?${prompt}
  10492: Yes. The chocobo escaped as soon as I finished talking to this adventurer here...${prompt}
  10493: And that's when he started behaving strangely? Could it be...?${prompt}
  10494: It has to be...the call of the wild.${prompt}
  10495: Oh, give me a break... These chocobos were raised in a stable, for Altana's sake!${prompt}
  10496: No. We must not rule out the possibility. Like Brutus, I also discovered my chocobo on the La Theine Plateau.${prompt}
  10497: And to make matters worse, the problem is spreading to the other chocobos.${prompt}
  10498: What are you saying? People and chocobos have a special bond, not broken so easily!${prompt}
  10499: You have to remember that chocobos are animals. They'll return to the wild if given the chance.${prompt}
  10500: This issue has the potential to cause great disorder among the chocobos if left unchecked. We must formulate a solution without delay.${prompt}
  10501: I think the problem lies in the very way we raise and train our chocobos.${prompt}
  10502: We've already debated this issue, right? We even just finished reforming the system!${prompt}
  10503: I still think it needs more work. We've been too slack on discipline.${prompt}
  10504: Raisin' chocobos is not just about discipline! We've had this discussion before!${prompt}
  10505: Then how do you explain our current problem? It'll be our responsibility if one of the chocobos harms someone!${prompt}
  10506: Settle down, both of you.${prompt}
  10507: We have grown so used to these types of discussions that we have lost sight of the big picture.${prompt}
  10508: I think we should ask this adventurer here for ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] opinion.${prompt}
  10509: You're right. That's why I invited ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] here, after all.${prompt}
  10510: |-
    What do you suggest?
    ${selection-lines}
    Return the chocobos to the wild.
    Give the chocobos a rest.
    Reform the chocobo raising system.
    Bring the chocobos together.${prompt}
  10511: But the chocobo stables would have to close, and we'd be out of our jobs!${prompt}
  10512: We could make a much better decision without this adventurer.${prompt}
  10513: You may be right...${prompt}
  10514: |-
    Wait!
    Let's give ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] another chance.${prompt}
  10515: |-
    ...Fine.
    Let us hear what you have to say, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10516: That would just give them lots of free time to think about returning to the wild, wouldn't it?${prompt}
  10517: See? Even ${name-player} agrees.${prompt}
  10518: You just don't know when to quit, do you?${prompt}
  10519: Please!${prompt}
  10520: That would just make them twice as bad, wouldn't it?${prompt}
  10521: |-
    Wait!
    We don't know until we try, right? Let's bring 'em both together!${prompt}
  10522: What's gotten into you all of a sudden?${prompt}
  10523: I think this adventurer is onto something. Besides, we're not going to solve anything by talking. We should give it a try!${prompt}
  10524: Well... If you feel that strongly about it...${prompt}
  10525: |-
    I guess that's it, then!
    I'll head for Jeuno later.${prompt}
  10526: This is such a waste of time...${prompt}
  10527: Do you really think this plan will work?${prompt}
  10528: Great. I'm behind ya all the way!${prompt}
  10529: Please make your way to the chocobo stables in Jeuno. I will bring the chocobo with me when I have finished my preparations.${prompt}
  10530: I am Hantileon, President of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society.${prompt}
  10531: You also seem to like chocobos... I can tell by the look in your eyes. I will allow you to join our society.${prompt}
  10532: Trade an egg to me if you want to start raising a chocobo.${prompt}
  10533: You seem to be raising a chocobo at another nation's stables. Just ask Arvilauge if you have any questions.${prompt}

  10757: “Endurance” is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.${prompt}
  10758: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as “Physical attributes.”${prompt}
  10759: “Discernment” is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.${prompt}
  10760: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  10761: “Receptivity” is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.${prompt}
  10762: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as “Mental attributes.”${prompt}
  10763: “Energy” is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.${prompt}
  10764: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!${prompt}
  10765: “Affection” is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!${prompt}
  10766: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.${prompt}

  10773: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).${prompt}
  10774: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.${prompt}
  10775: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.${prompt}
  10776: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.${prompt}
  10777: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.${prompt}
  10778: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.${prompt}
  10779: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.${prompt}
  10780: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.${prompt}
  10781: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.${prompt}
  10782: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.${prompt}
  10783: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}

  10785: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10786: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.${prompt}

  10788: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}
  10789: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.${prompt}
  10790: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.${prompt}
  10791: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.${prompt}

  10794: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.${prompt}

    Taking a walk.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10804: In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  10805: Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.${prompt}
  10806: On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.${prompt}
  10807: However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.${prompt}
  10808: You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.${prompt}
  10809: Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.${prompt}
  10810: You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.${prompt}
  10811: I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)${prompt}
  10812: Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.${prompt}
  10813: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.${prompt}
  10814: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.${prompt}
  10815: You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.${prompt}
  10816: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.${prompt}
  10817: Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!${prompt}

    What would you like to know about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Why feeding is important.
    Vegetables.
    Wildgrasses.
    Carrots.
    Worms.
    Medicines.
    Pastes.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10819: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.${prompt}
  10820: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.${prompt}
  10821: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.${prompt}
  10822: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!${prompt}
  10823: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.${prompt}
  10824: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!${prompt}
  10825: 'Just ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.${prompt}'
  10826: 'This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which ${item-plural: 0[2]} are most popular.${prompt}'
  10827: 'Chocobos also seem to enjoy ${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  10828: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.${prompt}
  10829: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.${prompt}
  10830: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, the effects are different.${prompt}'
  10831: 'In addition, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is effective for illness, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} for a stomachache. It''s a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.${prompt}'
  10832: Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.${prompt}
  10833: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]}, for example, affect the chocobo''s physical attributes, and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are good for its mental attributes. ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 2[2]} are in a category of their own.${prompt}'
  10834: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  10835: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!${prompt}
  10836: 'For example, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will dramatically increase your chocobo''s affection, and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} will restore its energy.${prompt}'
  10837: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...${prompt}
  10838: 'The most curious of all the worms is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...${prompt}'
  10839: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  10840: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} will restore your chocobo''s energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.${prompt}'
  10841: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.${prompt}'
  10842: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.${prompt}
  10843: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.${prompt}
  10844: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.${prompt}
  10845: Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.${prompt}

    Which would you like to ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Abilities.
    Temperament.
    Weather preferences.
    Nothing.${prompt}
  10847: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.${prompt}
  10848: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.${prompt}
  10849: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.${prompt}
  10850: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.${prompt}
  10851: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.${prompt}
  10852: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.${prompt}
  10853: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.${prompt}
  10854: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.${prompt}
  10855: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.${prompt}
  10856: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.${prompt}
  10857: 'When your chocobo retires, you will receive ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Be sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  10858: 'You can use the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  10859: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!${prompt}
  10860: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.${prompt}
  10861: 'You will need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}'
  10862: 'You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10863: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.${prompt}
  10864: 'When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  10865: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.${prompt}
  10866: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.${prompt}
  10867: 'When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to a VCS member.${prompt}'
  10868: 'Also, the ${item-singular: 0[2]}''s power will grow weak after you''ve used it several times.${prompt}'

  10874: 'You can use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.${prompt}'

  12335: |-
    Why not!?
    Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt}
  12336: We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt}
  12337: However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt}
  12338: The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt}
  12339: And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt}
  12340: Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt}
  12341: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  12342: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  12343: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  12344: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  12345: Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt}
  12346: Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt}
  12347: In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
  12348: Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt}
  12349: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12350: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  12351: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  12352: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  12353: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  12354: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  12355: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  12356: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  12357: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt}'
  12358: You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt}
  12359: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
  12360: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
  12361: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  12362: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  12363: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  12364: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}

    That's about it.${prompt}
  12644: A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt}
  12645: Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt}
  12646: In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt}
  12647: For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.${prompt}
  12648: The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt}
  12649: What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt}
  12650: Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12651: Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt}
  12652: The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt}
  12653: The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt}
  12654: The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt}
  12655: In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt}
  12656: Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt}
  12657: Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the “race grade.”${prompt}
  12658: For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt}
  12659: We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt}
  12660: No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt}
  12661: Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt}
  12662: As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt}
  12663: Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12664: Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt}
  12665: Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.${prompt}
  12666: The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.${prompt}
  12667: As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.${prompt}
  12668: Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
  12669: We have a total of four races that run in succession.${prompt}
  12670: Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.${prompt}
  12671: Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.${prompt}
  12672: Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!${prompt}

    I'm fine, thanks.${prompt}
  12674: There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.${prompt}
  12675: First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.${prompt}
  12676: Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a “race chocobo,” for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.${prompt}
  12677: Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...${prompt}
  12678: All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.${prompt}
  12679: A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.${prompt}
  12680: Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.${prompt}
  12681: There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.${prompt}
  12682: There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.${prompt}
  12683: 'Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.${prompt}'
  12684: 'In the event that you should lose or misplace your ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.${prompt}'
  12685: The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!${prompt}
  12686: You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.${prompt}
  12687: 'To collect, simply hand in the ${item-singular: 0[2]} you received during race signup at any signup center.${prompt}'
  12688: The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.${prompt}
  12689: You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.${prompt}
  12690: After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt}
  12691: This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt}
  12692: We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt}

    What would you like to ask?
    ${selection-lines}
    What is chocobetting?
    How do I bet?
    What are odds?
    When do I bet?
    How do I collect winnings?
    Nothing.${prompt}
  12694: Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt}
  12695: To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt}
  12696: Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt}
  12697: For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt}
  12698: And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt}
  12699: Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt}
  12700: The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt}
  12701: 'To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt}'
  12702: 'For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt}'
  12703: We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt}
  12704: Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt}
  12705: Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt}
  12706: It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt}
  12707: What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt}
  12708: 'Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt}'
  12709: The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt}
  12710: Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt}
  12711: Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt}
  12712: Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt}
  12713: 'Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt}'
  12714: 'Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt}'
  12715: '${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.${prompt}'

  12779: With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt}
  12780: As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt}
  12781: “The Monster Races”!${prompt}
  12782: Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt}
  12783: |-
    Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.
    What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt}
  12784: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
  12785: 'Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}'
  12786: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
  12787: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
  12788: Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt}
  12789: |-
    The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.
    It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt}
  12790: |-
    Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.
    If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt}
  12791: |-
    Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.
    Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt}
  12792: 'Depending on your chocobo''s performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12793: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
  12794: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
  12795: There are two main types of races.${prompt}
  12796: 'The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}'
  12797: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
  12798: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
  12799: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
  12800: 'The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo''s performance.${prompt}'

  12804: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
  12805: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
  12806: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
  12807: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
  12808: Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt}
  12809: |-
    We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.
    The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt}
  12810: |-
    Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.
    And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt}
  12811: |-
    As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.
    It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.
    Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  12812: |-
    In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.
    Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.
    It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt}
  12813: |-
    Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.
    These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt}
  12814: |-

  12877: Good day, fol--${prompt}
  12878: ピヨ！${prompt}
  12879: Sakura says that she loves you all from the bottom of her tiny heart.${prompt}

  12881: 'First we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, who will be ridden by ${choice: 1}[the ace of the chase, Ignazio/three-time chocobo racing all★star, Eudocia/the bloody emperor, Roinolier/the empress of speed, Maurette/Lami-Baami Suave Esquire III/the red rose of racing, Sosopapa/CRA legend, Khowa Mathgalhi/rising CRA star, Bayansh].${prompt}'
  12882: ピヨピヨ！${prompt}
  12883: She says, “When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.”${prompt}
  12884: She says, “And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' all☆star!“${prompt}
  12885: She says, “This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.”${prompt}
  12886: She says, “There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.”${prompt}
  12887: She says, “This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.”${prompt}
  12888: She says, “Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.”${prompt}
  12889: She says, “This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.”${prompt}
  12890: She says, ”This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'”${prompt}
  12891: 'Next we have ${choice: 0}[Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by ${choice: 0}[the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].${prompt}'
  12892: Sakura says, “Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!”${prompt}
  12893: Sakura says, “This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.”${prompt}
  12894: Sakura says, “Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.”${prompt}
  12895: 'Our next chocobo is ${choice: 0}[Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by ${choice: 0}[Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura''s number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].${prompt}'
  12896: Sakura says, “Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.”${prompt}
  12897: Sakura says, ”She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.”${prompt}

  12901: She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.${prompt}
  12902: She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.${prompt}
  12903: She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.${prompt}
  12904: And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.${prompt}
  12905: And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?${prompt}
  12906: The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.${prompt}
  12907: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.
  12908: And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...
  12909: '...and her obedient interpreter, everyone''s favorite lover of animals, Markovich!'
  12910: Good day, fol--
  12911: ピヨ！

  12916: Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
  12917: I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.${prompt}
  12918: Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!${prompt}
  12919: |-
    Yeah...
    Good luck, ${name-player}...${prompt}
  12920: Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.${prompt}
  12921: 'And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, ${choice: 0}[Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].${prompt}'
  12922: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'”${prompt}
  12923: Sakura says, “It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.”${prompt}
  12924: Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.${prompt}
  12925: They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.${prompt}
  12926: Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Wahboud!${prompt}
  12927: Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!${prompt}
  12928: As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.${prompt}
  12929: ${name-player}. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.${prompt}
  12930: Good luck, ${name-player}. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!${prompt}
  12931: Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!${prompt}
  12932: 'And next we have ${choice: 0}[Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by ${choice: 0}[VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].${prompt}'
  12933: ピヨッ！${prompt}
  12934: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.”${prompt}
  12935: Sakura says, “Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.”${prompt}
  12936: Sakura says, “Big things often come in small packages.”${prompt}
  12937: Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--${prompt}
  12938: a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!${prompt}
  12939: This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.${prompt}
  12940: Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!${prompt}
  12941: It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted “piece de resistance”?${prompt}
  12942: We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.${prompt}
  12943: Well, there you have it.${prompt}
  12944: Now let's take a look at today's participants...${prompt}

  12948: Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?${prompt}
  12949: Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  12950: Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--${prompt}
  12951: The Rakapopo Cup!${prompt}
  12952: Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku～pipi～!${prompt}
  12953: So～,♪ I've lea～rned that yo～u have entered♪ your ve～ry own pe～rsona～l♪ cho～cobo in the cu～p.♪ Wha～t do yo～u think her♪ cha～nces are of ta～king♪ ho～me the gra～nd pri～ze?♪${prompt}
  12954: Are yo～u making fun of me, si～r!? We～ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my～ gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai～ls across the finish line yea～rs before the nearest competitaru!♪${prompt}
  12955: Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.${prompt}
  12956: My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!${prompt}
  12957: '${choice: 0}[Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all★star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne～ver heard of ${choice: 0}[him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!${prompt}'
  12958: We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one “Kamp Kweh.” We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.${prompt}
  12959: Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...${prompt}
  12960: Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo～re than an embiggened brainy-wa～iny to beat Starlight!♪${prompt}
  12961: What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.${prompt}
  12962: Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...${prompt}
  12963: Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa～n! I won't let Starlight lo～se to some impo～ster!${prompt}
  12964: Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called “reincarnate's” redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!${prompt}
  12965: Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?${prompt}
  12966: Hah! Well, I～ have been riding cho～cobos for twenty-one years!${prompt}
  12967: 'And next is ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by ${choice: 1}[San d''Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d''Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!${prompt}'
  12968: Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.${prompt}
  12969: Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...${prompt}
  12970: Both Starlight a～nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha～t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!♪${prompt}
  12971: The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.${prompt}
  12972: When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.${prompt}
  12973: When the profe～ssor's not stumbling over his spee～ch impediment-ethy, he's re～searching the intricacies of chocobo beha～vioral patterns.${prompt}
  12974: And they're off!
  12975: Markovich, what did you think of the start?
  12976: Well, I fel--
  12977: ピヨピヨッ！
  12978: Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
  12979: Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  12980: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  12981: And as they pass the halfway mark...
  12982: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} holds on to the lead!'
  12983: '${number: 0} different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!'
  12984: 'While from behind the pack, #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  12985: 'While from behind, #${number: 2} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!'
  12986: 'All ${number: 0} chocobos battle for the lead!'
  12987: Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
  12988: And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
  12989: ピヨピヨ！
  12990: Sakura says, “The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.”
  12991: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  12992: 'What''s this!? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s jockey has pulled out ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}!'
  12993: 'Incredible! ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed is approaching dangerous limits!'
  12994: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!'
  12995: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  12996: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s speed has begun to drop off!'
  12997: 'It looks like ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has begun to tire!'
  12998: The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  12999: The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  13000: The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
  13001: The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
  13002: 'The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  13003: 'Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!?'
  13004: 'And yet ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} seems completely unaffected by the attack!'
  13005: And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  13006: And now they're approaching the final corner!
  13007: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  13008: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  13009: '#${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 3[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  13010: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} chocobos still fighting for the lead!'
  13011: The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  13012: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  13013: 'And ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} takes the crown!'
  13014: 'What''s this? #${number: 1} ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  13015: 'And it''s ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} by a beak!!!'
  13016: Let's take a look at the results...${prompt}
  13017: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})${prompt}'
  13018: There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!${prompt}
  13019: Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.${prompt}
  13020: Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.${prompt}
  13021: Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.${prompt}
  13022: |-
    What an amazing race!
    The other chocobos were no match for ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?${prompt}
  13023: 'What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty ${choice: 0}[Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird''s performance?${prompt}'
  13024: '${choice: 0}[Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!${prompt}'
  13025: The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.${prompt}
  13026: Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!${prompt}
  13027: Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...${prompt}
  13028: Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa～ctly as I expected!♪${prompt}
  13029: The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa～y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai～d so!${prompt}
  13030: |-
    And there you have it.
    This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!${prompt}
  13031: And now, let's see the results from the last race.
  13032: '${number: 2}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} (#${number: 1})'
  13033: And that's all she wrote, folks!
  13034: 'The winnings for a ${number: 0}-${number: 1} bet come to ${number: 2} gil per quill!'
  13035: Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
  13036: She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
  13037: She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
  13038: Until next time, race fans...
  13039: Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.${prompt}
  13040: 'Taking the crown for today''s race was none other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  13041: 'To the winning steed''s owner we present the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Rocochookie,” I mean, “Chocorookie”!${prompt}'
  13042: 'And to the ambitious and sporting ${name-player}, we present this undeniably useful ${item-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  13043: Good show, ${name-player}. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.${prompt}
  13044: |-
    Excellent race, ${name-player}!
    You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.${prompt}
  13045: Okay, ma～ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti～ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!${prompt}
  13046: Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.${prompt}
  13047: But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.${prompt}

  13061: With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...${prompt}
  13062: |-
    Oh...?
    Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?${prompt}
  13063: I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt}
  13064: |-
    Is that so...?
    Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt}
  13065: |-
    Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.
    You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt}
  13066: Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt}
  13067: Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt}
  13068: |-
    But of course! I had forgotten all about it!
    Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!
    Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt}
  13069: |-
    But that's not where it ends!
    There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt}
  13070: |-
    A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.
    Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt}
  13071: It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt}
  13072: |-
    Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!
    But...${prompt}
  13073: But...?${prompt}
  13074: I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt}
  13075: |-
    I see...
    Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt}
  13076: |-
    You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.
    Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt}
  13077: |-
    But enough talking, I say.
    It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt}
  13078: |-
    Oh, yes, right...
    Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!
    It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt}
  13079: 'In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt}'
  13080: |-
    Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?
    I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt}
  13081: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don''t let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep''s clothing”!${prompt}'
  13082: I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt}
  13083: I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt}
  13084: Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt}
  13085: Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt}
  13086: With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt}
  13087: |-
    Whoopee!
    Bring them on, I say!${prompt}
  13088: |-
    Erm...yes...
    Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt}
  13089: Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt}
  13090: |-
    Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!
    Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt}
  13091: |-
    Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.
    I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt}
  13092: And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt}
  13093: |-
    My, oh my...!
    I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt}
  13094: |-
    A-ahem!
    I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt}
  13095: |-
    All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!
    Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt}
  13096: |-
    It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...
    <Sniffle>${prompt}
  13097: |-
    Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    ...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt}
  13098: |-
    Hrmmm...
    Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt}
  13099: Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt}
  13100: |-
    What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!
    There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt}
  13101: Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt}
  13102: |-
    And won't you look at the lineup!
    This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?
    I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt}
  13103: And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt}
  13104: |-
    Huh?
    Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt}
  13105: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt}
  13106: |-
    <Gulp>
    You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt}
  13107: '...Professor Shantotto!${prompt}'
  13108: |-
    If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,
    as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt}
  13109: |-
    Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,
    four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt}
  13110: |-
    So if you care to hear out my little proposal,
    these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt}
  13111: |-
    With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...
    Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt}
  13112: |-
    With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?
    Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt}
  13113: First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt}
  13114: |-
    Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.
    I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt}
  13115: Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt}
  13116: |-
    Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”
    Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt}
  13117: Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt}
  13118: |-
    Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.
    If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt}
  13119: Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt}
  13120: |-
    For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.
    Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt}
  13121: |-
    Um...Professor Shantotto...
    Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt}
  13122: |-
    Ohohohohoho!
    Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.
    But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt}
  13123: |-
    Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.
    Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt}
  13124: |-
    Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.
    So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt}
  13125: |-
    Ohohohohohoho!
    Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--
    that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt}
  13126: |-
    The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.
    But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt}
  13127: |-
    H-hey!
    What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt}
  13128: |-
    My, my, what a pleasant surprise!
    I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt}
  13129: |-
    How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!
    This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt}
  13130: |-
    Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.
    I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt}
  13131: |-
    And you, Goccilo!
    What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt}
  13132: |-
    Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!
    Until next time...!${prompt}
  13133: ${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt}
  13134: |-
    What's with the baffled expression?
    It's me, Sakura.${prompt}
  13135: |-
    You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.
    I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt}
  13136: I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt}
  13137: I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt}
  13138: And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt}
  13139: I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt}
  13140: Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt}
  13141: I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  13142: I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13143: |-
    And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
    But something seems to be different...
    Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt}
  13144: She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt}
  13145: The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt}
  13146: |-
    I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!
    A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt}
  13147: And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt}
  13148: It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt}
  13149: |-
    And that completes the lineup, folks.
    With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt}
  13150: 'You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  13151: Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13152: I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt}
  13153: I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt}
  13154: I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt}
  13155: |-
    But no more...
    If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt}
  13156: This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt}
  13157: I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13158: Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt}
  13159: Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt}
  13160: I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt}
  13161: Next, we have Sakura...${prompt}
  13162: |-
    Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
    This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt}
  13163: |-
    Well I'll be...
    In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt}
  13164: '...${prompt}'
  13165: |-
    Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.
    For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt}
  13166: '${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt}'
  13167: |-
    Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!
    Congratulations!${prompt}
  13168: |-
    Great race, ${name-player}.
    It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt}
  13169: |-
    But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..
    With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt}
  13170: |-
    Princess...
    Princess Sakura!${prompt}
  13171: |-
    Princess...?
    What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt}
  13172: |-
    Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.
    I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt}
  13173: Searching for...me?${prompt}
  13174: |-
    Yes, Your Highness.
    You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt}
  13175: |-
    Are you serious!?
    Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt}
  13176: |-
    That is correct.
    Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt}
  13177: D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt}
  13178: |-
    ...!
    I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt}
  13179: Wh...what happened?${prompt}
  13180: |-
    You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.
    You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt}
  13181: She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt}
  13182: |-
    Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.
    But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt}
  13183: My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt}
  13184: So that's what happened...${prompt}
  13185: Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt}
  13186: '...${prompt}'
  13187: I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt}
  13188: |-
    Your Highness!
    But...why!?${prompt}
  13189: Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt}
  13190: What's more...${prompt}
  13191: I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt}
  13192: I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt}
  13193: What...?${prompt}
  13194: The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt}
  13195: |-
    And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?
    I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt}
  13196: I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt}
  13197: |-
    Heehee!
    Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt}
  13198: |-
    ${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!
    Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt}
  13199: You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13200: Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt}
  13201: |-
    What?
    How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt}
  13202: |-
    Hohoho...
    It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt}
  13203: I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt}
  13204: |-
    Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?
    No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt}
  13205: Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt}
  13206: |-
    <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.
    But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt}
  13207: |-
    You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.
    To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt}
  13208: |-
    And you, our new Chocochampion!
    Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.${prompt}
  13209: |-
    Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today.
    These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.${prompt}
  13210: And they're off!
  13211: |-
    Hrmmm!
    ${choice: 0}[Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
  13212: Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
  13213: |-
    All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance.
    But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
  13214: Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
  13215: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
  13216: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.'
  13217: The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
  13218: The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
  13219: And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
  13220: 'It''s crowded up front with ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?'
  13221: 'It''s crowded up front with all ${number: 0} contestants still fighting for the lead!'
  13222: The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
  13223: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has used ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}!'
  13224: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?'
  13225: '${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?'
  13226: 'It doesn''t look like anyone will be catching ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} today!'
  13227: 'What''s this? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is making its move on the lead!'
  13228: '${number: 1}: ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}${prompt}'
  13229: 'What''s this!? ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s using ${choice: 1}[Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!'
  13230: 'Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those ${choice: 0}[monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!'
  13231: |-
    ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed!
    And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
  13232: "I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s step. \nAnd the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!"
  13233: |-
    And here's some unexpected drama, folks!
    The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
  13234: 'Look at that! ${lettercase: 1}${chocobo-name: 0[2]}''s stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!'
  13235: |-
    Uh-oh, what's going on here!?
    The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
  13236: 'Oooh! In a bold move, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has just used a ${choice: 0}[Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!'
  13237: |-
    What's this!?
    All of the chocobos other than ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
  13238: |-
    Thanks to that brazen little act, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks!
    That just might seal the deal for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!
  13239: |-
    Never in all my days, race fans!
    In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
  13240: |-
    How could my creation make such a rookie mistake?
    In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
  13241: Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
  13242: The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
  13243: The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
  13244: The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
  13245: |-
    Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!?
    What in the world do you think you're doing!?
  13246: |-
    Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame.
    This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
  13247: |-
    What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today?
    I've heard it being said that today's ${choice: 0}[creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal.
    This could get heavy, folks!
  13248: |-
    All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them.
    Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
  13249: It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
  13250: |-
    There's still plenty of race to go, race fans!
    More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
  13251: And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
  13252: |-
    The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now.
    This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
  13253: |-
    This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent.
    Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
  13254: |-
    And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty!
    Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
  13255: |-
    And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them!
    But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
  13256: |-
    I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call!
    Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
  13257: |-
    It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now!
    The time for a final spurt is now or never!
  13258: And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
  13259: |-

    Read which chapter?
    ${selection-lines}
    1. “The Heart of Venture Roll.”
    2. “Rules of the Roll.”
    3. “Putting the Book Down.”${prompt}
  13280: Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.${prompt}
  13281: 'Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (${color: 5}doubling up${color: 1}) as many times as the table time limit allows (${number: 8} ${choice-plurality: 8}[minute/minutes], Earth time).${prompt}'
  13282: 'In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (${color: 5}hold fast${color: 1}).${prompt}'
  13283: If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.${prompt}
  13284: Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).${prompt}
  13285: 'Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.${prompt}'
  13286: 'If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a ${color: 5}draw${color: 1} and all participation fees are repaid in full.${prompt}'
  13287: Once the game has started, fees will not be refunded for any reason unless the match results in a draw.${prompt}
  13288: |-
    Ah, if it isn't ${name-player}!
    Perchance you have come to question the authenticity of my testimony regarding the Sentinels. I do not deny that I may have possibly added a bit of color to the facts surrounding the true nature of our fine leader, but all's well that ends well, no?${prompt}
  13289: Ah, yet you need not fret any longer, my fine friend. Our prodigal president and provider once again has proffered forth her ever-giving hands in a selfless gesture of heartwarming charity.${prompt}
  13290: From this day forth, all employees of Salaheem's Sentinels can now teleport freely from San d'Oria to Aht Urhgan Whitegate!${prompt}
  13291: 'And by freely, I mean in the sense of “free as a bird” as I will require a fee of ${number: 0} gil from those who wish to partake in my services.${prompt}'

    It's here! It's here!
    The season of Celestial Nights is upon us! And to celebrate, the moogles are bringing together lost loves by offering free teleportation to San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst!${prompt}
  13297: If there's someone you've been longing to see, just let me know and I'll warp you right to their side (provided they are in either San d'Oria, Bastok, or Windurst), kupo!${prompt}

  13300: Oh, that's right! I almost forgot to give you this, kupo!${prompt}
  13301: Are you ready for another spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?${prompt}
  13302: |-
    We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon.
    Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!${prompt}

    Oh, a new adventurer!
    Best of luck, kupo!${prompt}

    Are you helping out the new adventurers?
    Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!${prompt}
  13305: Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!${prompt}
  13306: |-
    The face in the portrait you brought me is just...
    Kupupupu!${prompt}
  13307: |-
    You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo?
    Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.${prompt}
  13308: This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!${prompt}
  13309: |-
    To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal.
    Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!${prompt}
  13310: |-
    This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties.
    Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!${prompt}
  13311: |-
    Please come back with a different partner.
    It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!${prompt}
  13312: |-
    Your partner isn't ready to go.
    Please wait a little longer, kupo.${prompt}
  13313: |-
    Your partner must talk to me as well.
    I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.${prompt}
  13314: |-
    You can only choose one partner a day.
    Come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt}
  13315: |-
    Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner!
    You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!${prompt}
  13316: Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.${prompt}
  13317: Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?${prompt}
  13318: |-
    Are you ready to go?
    ${selection-lines}
    Ready, kupo!
    I'm too terrified, kupo!${prompt}
  13319: |-
    I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal.
    You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.${prompt}
  13320: |-
    If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you!
    Now, off you go, kupo!${prompt}
  13321: 'You can only carry one ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  13322: Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?${prompt}
  13323: |-
    Hey, you changed partners!
    You can't switch halfway through, kupo!${prompt}
  13324: |-
    Wait, the number of people in your party has changed!
    You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!${prompt}
  13325: |-
    Choose your partner wisely.
    Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!${prompt}
  13326: Adventurer! Adventurer!${prompt}
  13327: |-
    Might you lend a poor Moogle a hand?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure!
    Doing what?
    Not today.${prompt}
  13328: |-
    A thousand thanks, kupo!
    Your participation in the Neo Crystal War will benefit your nation in ways beyond imagination!${prompt}
  13329: |-
    Rules? Why, they are simple, my friend!
    All you need do is sneak your way into beastman lairs and retrieve shards from the ${color: 5}cyclopean crystals${color: 1} located about the strongholds, kupo!${prompt}
  13330: Which lairs? Must I tell you everything, adventurer? Moogle intelligence reports that the crystals can be found in the Ghelsba Outpost, Davoi, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja. Now what are you waiting for, kupo!?${prompt}
  13331: You see, recently there has been much unrest amongst our many Moogle factions, kupo.${prompt}
  13332: Why, you ask? Well, at one of our gatherings, an argument broke out regarding the Crystal War 20 years gone.${prompt}
  13333: 'It all started with the question: which nation played the biggest role in the allied forces'' victory over the beastmen armies?${prompt}'
  13334: And from there things degraded into a shouting match pitting San d'Oria versus Bastok versus Windurst, kupo...${prompt}
  13335: However, at the end of the day, no one could present hard evidence to the claim of their nation's greatness.${prompt}
  13336: And that is when one of our elders came up with a foolproof method to put an end to our doubts--we would have adventurers from all three nations fight the war again, kupo!${prompt}
  13337: By fighting, I don't mean fighting each other, but fighting the beastmen like our fathers did 20 years ago!${prompt}
  13338: One of the ways the allied armies were able to defeat the enemy was by intercepting and cutting off the Shadow Lord's crystal supply routes.${prompt}
  13339: We want you and other adventurers from across Vana'diel to take on the roles of allied solders and infiltrate beastman strongholds, kupo.${prompt}
  13340: Once inside, you are to locate large formations where the beastmen have been storing crystals over the past two decades...${prompt}
  13341: '...and break off as many shards as possible, then bring them back here, kupo.${prompt}'
  13342: The nation that brings back the most shards will be declared the Crystal War's “Most Valuable Nation” and the Moogles' squabbles will finally come to an end.${prompt}
  13343: |-
    So, what do you say, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'm in.
    Maybe later.${prompt}
  13344: Kupopo... Did I mention that there will be wondrous prizes to adventurers from the victorious nation? Oh well, if you have a change of heart, you'll know where to find me!${prompt}
  13345: Kupopo...${prompt}
  13346: Welcome back, adventurer! Let me see how many shards you have retrieved, kupo...${prompt}
  13347: 'My records show that you have brought your nation a total of ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[shard/shards], but I know you''re not done yet, are you?${prompt}'
  13348: 'Amazing! You''ve already collected ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[shard/shards], kupo! I think I have something extra special for you!${prompt}'
  13349: Here's a little something to keep you motivated, kupo!${prompt}
  13350: 'Why are you talking to me? You should be out there aiding ${choice: 1}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst]''s fight to prove you are better than those ${choice: 0}[San d''Orians/Bastokers/Windurstians], kupo!${prompt}'
  13351: 'Congratulations on your victory, ${choice: 0}[San d''Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian]! Your nation has been selected Crystal War MVN, kupo! As a reward, I shall teleport you to any nation of your choice!${prompt}'
  13352: |-
    Where would like to go, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nowhere.
    San d'Oria.

    Windurst.${prompt}
  13353: Happy travels, kupo!${prompt}

  13383: Hé ! Toi là ! Aventurier ! As-tu déjà vu un ver des sables ? Tu sais, un ver gigantesque, avec un corps segmenté, qui vit dans le sable ?${prompt}
  13384: Eh bien… hmmm… Oh ! Et une coccinelle, alors ? Ce sont de petits nuisibles distinctifs avec des corps rouge vif, semicirculaires, trois taches noires caractéristiques et…${prompt}
  13385: |-
    Je m’excuse, j’ai complètement oublié mes manières ! Tu dois m’excuser.
    C’est un plaisir de faire ta connaissance. Je suis Atelloune, assistante du célèbre biologiste, le professeur Clauvert B Chanoix.${prompt}
  13386: Pour aider les recherches du professeur, je recherche toutes sortes de spécimens de Quon et de Mindartia dont les populations ont diminué ces dernières années.${prompt}
  13387: J’ai juste pensé qu’un aventurier comme toi avait sûrement vu des créatures rares au cours de tes voyages… mais tant pis. Désolée de t’avoir dérangé.${prompt}
  13388: Salutations, aventurier. San d’Oria est reconnaissante pour tes services. Je suis l’Écuyer Royal Esmallegue.${prompt}
  13389: Le Grand Chevalier Depardal a quitté son poste de sentinelle dans les Terres Extérieures. Pour l’instant, il a été enrôlé comme membre de la force de défense de la ville.${prompt}
  13390: Comme tu le sais probablement déjà, l’armée de San d’Oria est divisée en deux branches, les Chevaliers Royaux et les Chevaliers du Temple.${prompt}
  13391: En temps de paix, nous, les Chevaliers Royaux, sommes chargés de la défense de la nation, tandis que les Chevaliers du Temple sont responsables du maintien de l’ordre public. Cependant, en temps de guerre, les Chevaliers du Temple ont pour rôle de superviser nos rangs.${prompt}
  13392: Malheureusement, cela est source de certains conflits. Bien que réunis sous un même royaume, il existe une forte rivalité entre les deux armées. On dit que pendant la Grande Guerre, il y avait de nombreux points de friction entre nous.${prompt}
  13393: Bonjour. Dis, si tu as un peu de temps, pourrais-tu m’écouter un instant ? J’ai un petit problème…${prompt}
  13394: Eh bien, je ne sais pas si tu le savais déjà ou non, mais je suis Atelloune, assistante du grand zoologiste, le professeur Clavauert B Chanoix.${prompt}
  13395: Je reçois beaucoup de courrier dans mon travail. Tu sais, des lettres de personnes de tous âges passionnées par les animaux, qui me posent toutes sortes de questions.${prompt}
  13396: J’ai récemment trouvé une lettre dont l’écriture tremblante a attiré mon attention.${prompt}
  13397: Elle a été envoyée par un jeune garçon elvaan qui n’a pas donné son nom.${prompt}
  13398: « Chère Atelloune, mon grand-père dit que quand il avait mon âge, il y avait de gros insectes rouges et ronds à Ronfaure.${prompt}
  13399: « Mais je pense qu’il devient sénile et qu’il confond avec une pomme. Ou alors c’est un menteur, et il n’y a jamais eu d’insectes comme ça. Dis-lui qu’il est fou, s’il te plaît. »${prompt}
  13400: '…Hmmm.${prompt}'
  13401: Je suis vraiment désolée de t’embêter avec ça.${prompt}
  13402: 'C’est juste que ce gamin m’a vraiment tapé sur les nerfs. Je veux dire, il n’y a même pas de question ! C’est tellement agaçant…${prompt}'
  13403: |-
    Je pense qu’il fait référence à la coccinelle.
    C’était une espèce de vermine qui habitait la région de Ronfaure avant la guerre.${prompt}
  13404: Tu sais, quand j’étais petite fille, je les ai prises pour des pom—${prompt}
  13405: Peu importe ça !${prompt}
  13406: Concentrons-nous sur le vrai problème ici. La coccinelle est censée avoir disparu il y a longtemps.${prompt}
  13407: Mais c’est là que ça devient vraiment intéressant !${prompt}
  13408: Je crois qu’il doit encore y avoir des coccinelles quelque part dans Vana’diel ! Si tu en vois une lors de tes voyages, essaie de me ramener un spécimen vivant, s’il te plaît !${prompt}
  13409: 'Attends… ça va être difficile. Ce sont en fait des animaux assez grands. Et je ne voudrais pas leur faire mal… Eh bien, si tu tombes par hasard sur le cadavre de l’un d’eux, penses-tu que tu pourrais me ramener les ${item-plural: 0[2]} ? Tu les reconnaîtras quand tu les verras. C’est tout ce dont j’ai besoin.${prompt}'
  13410: J’aimerais vraiment épater ce petit garnement. Et je pense que ça ferait parfaitement l’affaire.${prompt}
  13411: 'Oh mon Dieu ! Est-ce vraiment ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} !?${prompt}'
  13412: Wow, c’est encore plus beau que je ne l’imaginais. Quelle brillance ! Et ce contraste entre le rouge et le noir… Absolument remarquable !${prompt}
  13413: Où as-tu trouvé ça !?${prompt}
  13414: Ahhh, tu gardes tes cartes bien cachées, hein ? C’est bien, fais comme tu veux.${prompt}
  13415: Peu importe. C’est exactement ce dont j’ai besoin pour convaincre ce petit garnement elvaan. Peut-être qu’il reconnaîtra enfin la véritable beauté de la coccinelle !${prompt}
  13416: Dire que ce pauvre grand-père a été traité de menteur par son propre petit-fils ! Eh bien, ça devrait l’aider à dormir la nuit.${prompt}
  13417: Je dois dire que tout ça, c’est grâce à toi. Je vais te dire quoi. En échange, je vais te révéler un petit secret…${prompt}
  13418: La vraie raison pour laquelle les coccinelles ont disparu…${prompt}
  13419: |-
    Pour être honnête, même les esprits les plus éminents dans le domaine de l’écologie n’ont pas pu expliquer pourquoi c’est arrivé.
    Mais j’ai découvert… d’autres informations.${prompt}
  13420: La rumeur dit qu’à l’époque de la Grande Guerre, les coccinelles ont été chassées jusqu’à l’extinction par un peuple inconsidéré, sans aucun égard pour l’équilibre naturel.${prompt}
  13421: Ils étaient décrits comme semblant possédés, un groupe étrange et inquiétant. Obsédés par les couleurs rouge et noir des coccinelles, qu’ils murmuraient constamment, comme en transe. « Rouge… noir… »${prompt}
  13422: Je n’ai aucun doute que ces ailes étaient très demandées pour une raison ou une autre à l’époque.${prompt}
  13423: Par exemple, peut-être que certains stratèges militaires ont imaginé une application pour ce motif caractéristique qui effraie si efficacement les prédateurs.${prompt}
  13424: Les possibilités sont infinies !${prompt}
  13425: '…${prompt}'
  13426: Quoi ? Pourquoi me regardes-tu comme ça ?${prompt}
  13427: Ne te méprends pas. Je veillerai à ce que ces ailes parviennent à ce petit garçon elvaan… dès que j’aurai fini de faire quelques tests de mon côté !${prompt}
  13428: Tiens, prends ça et va-t’en. Et pas de visites impromptues ! J’ai du travail à faire…${prompt}
  13429: Bienvenue aux Sources du Lion !${prompt}
  13430: Tu souhaites ma permission pour danser sur scène ?${prompt}
  13431: Eh bien, je n’ai pas eu de danseurs ici depuis que la Troupe Brilioth nous a honorés de sa représentation.${prompt}
  13432: |-
    Si je me souviens bien, mes clients étaient follement enthousiastes…
    Leurs acclamations ont fait trembler les murs mêmes de la taverne.${prompt}
  13433: |-
    Es-tu sûr d’être un danseur ?
    C’est juste que tu sembles si… nerveux.${prompt}
  13434: |-
    Eh bien, je suppose que même les professionnels ont le trac de temps en temps.
    Permets-moi de préparer le public…${prompt}
  13435: C’est maintenant ta chance de captiver le cœur du public.${prompt}

  13439: Mes yeux…${prompt}
  13440: Ton style de danse est… assez unique.${prompt}
  13441: Tu sais, je ne suis pas sûr que mon établissement soit le bon endroit pour une performance aussi « originale »…${prompt}
  13442: Ton style de danse était… assez unique…${prompt}
  13443: |-
    Toi là, aventurier !
    Je me demande si tu as entendu parler des soi-disant « Gueules Caverneuses » ?
    C’est ainsi que beaucoup appellent les étranges effigies de pierre qui apparaissent à travers Vana’diel.${prompt}
  13444: Je ne sais pas si c’est vrai ou non, mais certains disent que ce sont les rituels maléfiques des charmeurs orcs sur les pierres qui les ont fait prendre cette forme misérable.${prompt}
  13445: La zone résidentielle de San d’Oria est droit devant. Tu y trouveras ta Maison Mog.${prompt}
  13446: La zone résidentielle est droit devant. Rends-toi à ta chambre louée, étranger !${prompt}

  13544: The Tanners' Guild in Windurst where he worked suffered irreparable damage during the Crystal War.${prompt}

  13546: I'm following in my father's footsteppy-weps and apprenticing here alongside my sister, Tek--it's a long story--over there.${prompt}
  13547: Our mission is to fulfill Father's dreamy-weam of rebuilding the guild in Windurst.${prompt}
  13548: |-
    Kipopo!
    You have a quota to fulfill, have you not? You may socialize all you wish--after your duties are done!${prompt}
  13549: Well, another day, another step closer to realizing my dreams!${prompt}
  13550: You will find a guardswoman named Alaune at the Westgate, south west from here. She has further information that should prove useful in your adventuring.${prompt}
  13551: Greetings and well met! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service.${prompt}
  13552: Greetings and well met! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.${prompt}
  13553: Greetings and well met! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service.${prompt}
  13554: |-
    Mon rôle est d’accompagner ceux qui découvrent la vie d’aventurier en Vana’diel.
    Je suis spécialisé dans les connaissances de base nécessaires pour réussir dans cette voie, ainsi que dans les méthodes pédagogiques associées.
    Avec mon aide, vous pouvez être certain que vos premiers pas sur le chemin de l’aventure seront les bons.${prompt}
  13555: Si vous vous considérez encore comme un débutant, je vous recommande vivement de tirer pleinement parti de mes services.${prompt}
  13556: |-
    C’est ici mon poste attitré, et je ne le quitte jamais. Retenez-le bien.
    Si vous avez besoin d’un coup de main, pour quoi que ce soit, n’hésitez pas à venir me voir.${prompt}
  13557: |-
    Alors, ça vous tente d’accomplir quelques tâches de niveau débutant pour vous mettre sur la voie de la grandeur ?
    Ne vous inquiétez pas, j’ai exactement ce qu’il vous faut !${prompt}
  13558: Allez parler au garde Aravoge juste là-bas, et demandez-lui de vous lancer “Signe”. Ensuite, revenez me voir.${prompt}
  13559: Allez parler au garde Loup Enragé juste là-bas, et demandez-lui de vous lancer “Signe”. Ensuite, revenez me voir.${prompt}
  13560: Allez parler à la garde Harara juste là-bas, et demandez-lui de vous lancer “Signe”. Ensuite, revenez me voir.${prompt}
  13561: On dirait que vous avez bien reçu le Signe. Facile, non ?${prompt}
  13562: |-
    Tant que le Signe est actif, vous avez une chance d’obtenir des cristaux sur les ennemis que vous vainquez.
    Il offre aussi des avantages concrets, comme une défense et une esquive accrues.${prompt}
  13563: |-
    Le Signe vous aide même hors combat. Par exemple, il accélère votre régénération lorsque vous vous reposez.
    Pour toutes ces raisons, vous devriez considérer qu’avoir le Signe sur vous en tout temps est essentiel.${prompt}
  13564: 'Très bien ! Pour avoir accompli avec succès votre première mission, je vous remets ces ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  13565: |-
    Il y a plus ici qu’il n’y paraît ! C’était une blague…
    Bref, c’est ce qu’on appelle un “repas” parmi les aventuriers.
    Ce repas en particulier augmentera temporairement votre puissance d’attaque lorsque vous le consommerez.${prompt}
  13566: |-
    Lorsque vous mangez un repas, vous recevez un bonus temporaire d’état.
    Naturellement, chaque repas confère des effets différents.${prompt}
  13567: |-
    En règle générale, les plats à base de viande augmentent l’attaque.
    Les plats de fruits de mer, eux, renforcent souvent la défense, et ainsi de suite.
    Choisissez bien votre repas selon vos objectifs.${prompt}
  13568: |-
    Une chose à savoir cependant : vous ne pouvez pas consommer un repas si un autre effet de repas est encore actif.
    Votre estomac… exploserait !${prompt}
  13569: |-
    Hmm, cela fait beaucoup d’informations à assimiler…
    Vous suivez toujours ?${prompt}
  13570: |-
    Tout va bien jusqu’ici ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Réexpliquez-moi le Signe.
    Réexpliquez-moi les repas.
    C’est du gâteau.${prompt}
  13571: |-
    Great! Well, talking can only prepare you so much. Let's get right down to it.
    Go ahead and pop one of those ${item-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt}
  13572: |-
    After eating a meal, a status icon designated as “Food” will appear in the upper-left portion of your screen.
    Come back and talk to me again once you've confirmed that it's there.${prompt}
  13573: |-
    Check out the full belly on you! Well done!
    Signet and meals can both play crucial roles whenever you take on any type of enemy.
    This is a key lesson that you would do well not to forget!${prompt}
  13574: |-
    Next, let's get those pristine hands of yours nice and dirty!
    No sense in letting that food go to waste now, is there? Let's send you out to fight a monster on a full stomach!${prompt}
  13575: Exiting through that gate over there will lead you into an area with hostile enemies.${prompt}
  13576: |-
    Try to target one of the monsters and then select the “Check” option from your menu.
    This will help you ascertain an enemy's level of difficulty and make sure they are not too strong. A smart adventurer picks ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] fights.${prompt}
  13577: Be warned. Engaging any enemy that checks as “very tough” or above will result in your Signet not granting you the defense and evasion bonuses you would otherwise receive.${prompt}
  13578: And that brings us to your next assignment!${prompt}
  13579: It's high time you learned how to use a “weapon skill”!${prompt}
  13580: Perhaps you've already noticed, but sometimes while fighting an enemy, your “skills” will rise little by little.${prompt}
  13581: When your skill with the weapon you are wielding reaches a predetermined value, weapon skills will become available for use.${prompt}
  13582: |-
    “Combo” for those adept with hand-to-hand weapons. “Wasp Sting” for those who fight with daggers.
    “Fast Blade” for those who prefer the sword.${prompt}
  13583: |-
    “Shining Strike” for wielders of the club. “Heavy Swing” for those who take up the staff.
    And on, and on, and on...${prompt}
  13584: |-
    Selecting “Status” from the main menu will bring up the “Combat Skl.” option.
    This will display all of the current skill values in all weapon categories.${prompt}
  13585: |-
    The first weapon skill for each weapon type can be learned at a skill value of 5.
    So make that your first goal, and we'll take it from there!${prompt}
  13586: |-
    Ohhh! Somebody went and learned a new weapon skill, didn't ${choice-player-gender}[he/she]?
    Very good!${prompt}
  13587: |-
    I can see by that twinkle in your eyes that you've already used it on some poor, unfortunate creature, but I'll explain just a bit more.
    Whenever your “Tactical Points” (TP) reach 1000 or more, selecting “Abilities” and then “Weapon Skl.” from the menu will display a list of usable weapon skills.${prompt}
  13588: |-
    These are deadly techniques capable of rendering massive damage on enemies.
    It is well worth an adventurer's time to learn and master them.${prompt}
  13589: Ah, by the way, were you fortunate enough to receive some items from the monsters you fought?${prompt}
  13590: |-
    If you were lucky enough to come across any ${item-plural: 0[2]}, make sure you hang onto them.
    They may pay dividends later on...${prompt}
  13591: |-
    Also, that reminds me. There is another lesson better learned sooner than later.
    The items you will no doubt come across known as “crystals,” such as ${item-plural: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]}, are extremely significant.${prompt}
  13592: |-
    They are truly versatile items that can be used for a number of purposes.
    These include trading them to guards for certain rewards, and selling them to earn money, just to name a few.${prompt}
  13593: For now, I'd like to explain more about another of their uses. Namely, the role they play in “synthesis.”${prompt}
  13594: |-
    But first things first. Your reward for completing your last assignment! Here you are, then.
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and last but not least, ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}
  13595: |-
    Now, using ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} will bring up the synthesis interface.
    Once there, select the ${item-singular: 1[2]} and ${item-singular: 2[2]} as the ingredients to be added.${prompt}
  13596: All that remains is to select the “OK” option, and the synthesis will commence!${prompt}
  13597: |-
    You'll find that the crafting process will never begin, should the ingredients you've selected not form a viable synthesis recipe.
    Also, even when your materials are correct, there is always a chance that your synthesis will fail, so please be wary.${prompt}
  13598: The majority of items which you create via synthesis, as well as most of those dropped by enemies you defeat, can be placed on the “Auction House” for sale.${prompt}
  13599: The auction house is an ultra-consumer venue where you can attempt to purchase the wares of other players by placing bids, as well as have other players bid on items you have put up for sale.${prompt}
  13600: |-
    My words alone can do no justice to the vast cornucopia of goods that is the auction house.
    One simply must see it with one's own eyes.${prompt}
  13601: |-
    Are you still with me?
    ${selection-lines}
    Explain synthesis again.
    Explain the auction house again.
    Sure am.${prompt}
  13602: Somewhere in this great city lies our nation's auction house. Seek it out, and report back to me when you have found it.${prompt}
  13603: |-
    You needn't worry about going through with an actual purchase.
    Simply examining any of the “Auction Counters” will more than suffice.${prompt}
  13604: |-
    So, you were able to locate the auction house!
    Pretty hard to miss, isn't it?${prompt}
  13605: |-
    What do you think? It is as I said, yes? Few organizations in this world exceed the auction house in scale.
    It will never cease to be of use to you throughout your adventures. It would be wise to become adept at using it.${prompt}
  13606: |-
    And now down to brass tacks!
    Let's see if we can't get you to up some levels!${prompt}
  13607: There are several items in existence which serve to enhance the number of experience points you receive for defeating enemies.${prompt}
  13608: 'For example, there are ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and ${item-plural: 2[2]}, just to name a few.${prompt}'
  13609: These are a bit unique in that you must wait a certain amount of time after equipping them before you may use them.${prompt}
  13610: |-
    There is also a predetermined amount of time, usually quite long, that must pass before these items can be used again.
    The total number of times you may use any single item is also limited, so be mindful of that as well.${prompt}
  13611: |-
    Many of these items may be obtained from the same guards that provide you with Signet.
    You need only exchange “Conquest Points” in order to acquire them.${prompt}
  13612: |-
    As a matter of fact, for finishing that last assignment, I'm going to give you this ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.
    With this, you'll be able to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} without having to use any of your Conquest Points.${prompt}
  13613: |-
    Head over to any guard and have a go at exchanging them for something.
    And after that, see if you can't make it all the way up to level four.
    I'll be right here waiting for you when you get back.${prompt}
  13614: |-
    With an experience bonus in place, it should take you practically no time at all.
    Good luck, and be careful! It can get quite hairy out there!${prompt}
  13615: |-
    Well, well, well! We might make an adventurer out of you just yet!
    Looks like we've almost washed all that green off of you.${prompt}
  13616: |-
    A bit of bad news now, though.
    Starting from level 31, anytime you are knocked unconscious your experience points will suffer a deduction.${prompt}
  13617: |-
    As a general rule, the amount penalized will be about 10% of the total amount required to reach the next level.
    You have to be more careful than ever from here on out!${prompt}
  13618: However, there are ways to minimize this loss of experience points.${prompt}
  13619: |-
    Like this, for example. Go on, take it. Your reward for reaching level four.
    It's called ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  13620: |-
    Using this will grant you a status known as “Reraise.”
    Whenever you are rendered unconscious while this effect is in place, you will have the option to revive yourself.${prompt}
  13621: |-
    Choosing to do so will cause you to be resuscitated in the very spot where you have fallen.
    In addition, as I stated previously, the amount of experience points you lose will be somewhat lessened.${prompt}
  13622: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and similar items work in the same manner as the ${item-plural: 1[2]} and the other experience bonus items I mentioned earlier.
    That is, once equipped, you must wait a certain period of time before they can be used, and there are both cooldown timers and limited charges as well.${prompt}
  13623: |-
    All of these items as a whole are collectively referred to as “enchanted items.”
    There is a vast array of other enchanted items with myriad other effects that will prove useful on your adventures.
    It may be worth the time and effort to better acquaint yourself with them at some point.${prompt}
  13624: |-
    It seems you're starting to get the hang of things.
    Next, I'd like for you to go and fight some enemies in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon].${prompt}
  13625: '${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/The Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] is located beyond the ${choice: 2}[southern/northern/northern] reaches of ${choice: 2}[West Ronfaure/North Gustaberg/East Sarutabaruta].${prompt}'
  13626: |-
    You're sure to encounter some new monsters there that you won't find prowling around the outskirts of the city.
    It may be a bit daunting, so I'll only require that you slay one such beast, and then head on back.${prompt}
  13627: |-
    Just keep in mind, the farther you stray from the city, the more ferocious monsters tend to be.
    Don't say I didn't warn you.${prompt}
  13628: |-
    Make sure to use the “Check” command to determine the strength of your enemy.
    If you find that you are surrounded by enemies too difficult for you, try heading back to a previous area closer to the city and leveling up a bit more first.${prompt}
  13629: |-
    I know those smells...
    You smell of victory! And of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon]! Good on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13630: But by now you must be getting sick and tired of fighting the same old monsters so close to the city walls, aren't you?${prompt}
  13631: If you are several levels beyond a monster and totally outclass them in every respect, checking them will yield a “too weak to be worthwhile” result.${prompt}
  13632: Killing monsters so far beneath you is borderline cowardice, and will net you no experience points.${prompt}
  13633: If you start to notice more and more of these “too weak” monsters around you, consider moving farther from the city to a more difficult area.${prompt}
  13634: |-
    Congratulations on another milestone! Reward tiiime!
    You've just earned yourself ${number: 0} experience points, hotshot.${prompt}
  13635: Let's dive right into your next assignment while that blood is still pumping!${prompt}
  13636: |-
    I'm going to up the stakes here a little bit, ${name-player}. But it's for your own good.
    I want you to go out and get all the way to level ten.${prompt}
  13637: |-
    Considering your current level and the knowledge you have, you shouldn't confine yourself to the immediate vicinity of the city.
    You're more than capable of besting monsters in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] at this point.${prompt}
  13638: |-
    I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. So how's it feel? You're moving on up in the world.
    Time to put some money in those pockets. A ${number: 1}-gil reward, just for you. Don't spend it all in one place.${prompt}
  13639: By now you should be relatively familiar with the basics of battle. Am I right or am I right?${prompt}
  13640: |-
    But don't go getting too cocky!
    This world is chock-full of monsters just waiting for the opportune moment to pounce and knock you out cold!${prompt}
  13641: |-
    Depending on the type of monster, there are several factors that could cause them to attack you without provocation.
    I'll enumerate some of the more common types of this blatantly aggressive behavior for you.${prompt}
  13642: For starters, and most obviously, there are monsters which detect by sight. They will attack you whenever you enter their field of vision. This is the most prevalent type. They simply cannot stand the sight of adventurers.${prompt}
  13643: |-
    Next, there are those monsters which detect by sound. They can be a bit more dangerous than visually-dependent monsters, in that they will attack the source of any sound within a certain prescribed radius.
    You may not think it, but there are a great many monsters whose aural senses are far more developed than their sense of sight.${prompt}
  13644: |-
    There are also monsters which detect their enemies' spellcasting. Much like the sound-detecting types, these monsters will attack the source of any magic casting within a certain radius of their being.
    Not surprisingly, many monsters in the arcana family rely heavily on this method of detection, which covers a comparatively larger range than the aforementioned sense of hearing.${prompt}
  13645: |-
    And finally, there are opportunistic monsters which prey upon the weak and near-dead, pinpointing their prey by detecting low hit points.
    The family of undead creatures abound in monsters of this type. Even more distressing, the fewer the hit points you have, the farther the distance from which you can be detected.${prompt}
  13646: Your next assignment will attempt to familiarize you with these detection methods, and train you to become adept at avoiding them.${prompt}
  13647: 'I want you to travel once again to ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], and retrieve an item known as a “Gate Crystal.”${prompt}'
  13648: 'Near the center of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], you will find a large, white, almost otherworldly structure. On the area map, it is labeled as the ${choice: 2}[Crag of Holla/Crag of Dem/Crag of Mea].${prompt}'
  13649: |-
    There you will find one of an enormous series of crystals known as “Telepoints.”
    Simply examine the telepoint you find there, and bring back your findings.${prompt}
  13650: 'Only when you present your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to me shall your assignment be complete.${prompt}'
  13651: |-
    Exercise the utmost caution. There are many extremely dangerous monsters in the area you will be visiting.
    And take extra care not to draw the attention of any beastmen.${prompt}
  13652: |-
    This shall be your final assignment.
    Go now, and may the Goddess watch over you.${prompt}
  13653: |-
    Ahhh, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, just as I requested.
    Excellent work, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13654: |-
    And now for some information regarding this little beauty.
    As long as you have this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, you will be able to be transported by the appropriate spell of teleportation directly to the telepoint from which you retrieved it.${prompt}
  13655: I doubt that you will have many opportunities to use it for the time being, but you would do well to remember what I have said.${prompt}
  13656: |-
    Several such telepoints exist, scattered throughout Vana'diel.
    Each has its own specific gate crystal, which you will receive the first time that you examine any of them.${prompt}
  13657: |-
    Let me take this time to offer you a most heartfelt congratulations, ${name-player}!
    You have successfully completed all of the assignments I have laid before you.${prompt}
  13658: 'And here I have a most fitting reward for you. A gift of ${number: 1} experience points, and ${number: 3} ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt}'
  13659: |-
    I fear that I have nothing more to teach you.
    From now on, your lessons will best be learned by giving a mindful ear to others and being ever observant on your travels.${prompt}
  13660: Do remember, though, that the paths open before you will multiply greatly should you cooperate with other adventurers.${prompt}
  13661: |-
    Leveling, for example, is an endeavor made immeasurably more efficient and enjoyable in the company of others.
    It helps to not only guarantee you some modicum of safety in numbers, but also rewards you with considerably more experience points than adventuring alone.${prompt}
  13662: |-
    I suppose it does require a good deal of courage to approach an adventurer you do not know, but I strongly encourage you to do so.
    It may prove to be the beginning of an extremely rewarding and long-lasting friendship.${prompt}
  13663: |-
    There may still be some small facets of adventuring that I can continue to offer you advice on.
    Should you ever have any questions or anxieties, please do not hesitate to come and see me again.
    I will do my best to be of service and set your heart at ease.${prompt}
  13664: Go now, and go well. The world awaits its next great adventurer, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13665: |-
    Good day to you! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service.
    Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
  13666: |-
    Good day to you! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.
    Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
  13667: |-
    Good day to you! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service..
    Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
  13668: |-
    What will you ask about?
    ${selection-lines}
    Nothing just now.
    Search comments.
    Skillchains.
    Magic bursts.
    Skillchains and elements.${prompt}
  13669: Just as their name implies, search comments are original messages composed by adventurers which are readily visible to others when using the search function.${prompt}
  13670: |-
    There are several different categories of search comments.
    These include, but are not limited to, “EXP Party,” “Items,” and “Missions and Quests.”${prompt}
  13671: Opening the “Search” function from the Main Menu and then selecting the “Comment” option will allow you to conduct a player search by comment type.${prompt}
  13672: For example, if you would like to search for other players to form a leveling party, you need only select “EXP Party” from the list displayed.${prompt}
  13673: Conversely, if you would like to advertise yourself as interested in being on the receiving end of an experience party invite, you can choose the “Edit Comment” command from the Search menu.${prompt}
  13674: |-
    Of course, search comment composition differs from person to person.
    You might want to conduct a search first to see what type of search comments are considered the norm before writing your own.${prompt}
  13675: Skillchains are devastating elemental phenomena which manifest themselves when weapon skills are carried out in a precise and well-timed order. ${prompt}
  13676: The very natures of the skillchains themselves differ widely, being dependent upon the weapon skills used and the order of their execution.${prompt}
  13677: To take a simple and timeless example, using the weapon skill “Red Lotus Blade” immediately after “Fast Blade” will yield a type of skillchain known as “Liquefaction.”${prompt}
  13678: Furthermore, adding a “Combo” after the liquefaction effect will produce a more advanced “Fusion” skillchain.${prompt}
  13679: |-
    In the taxonomy of skillchains, each type is related to one or more specific elements.
    Liquefaction is bound to the element of fire, for example, and fusion to both fire and light.${prompt}
  13680: Another crucial point, which I simply cannot emphasize enough, is the importance of timing in the execution of skillchains.${prompt}
  13681: |-
    One must not be too overzealous, but too much patience can also be damning.
    It is most ideal to time the latter weapon skill to begin just a second or two after the preceding one is complete.${prompt}
  13682: |-
    The possible weapon skill sequences and the different skillchains they yield are highly variegated.
    It is said of this time-tested battle art that it “takes a moment to learn, and a lifetime to master.”${prompt}
  13683: |-
    Magic bursts are another type of supernatural phenomena which occur after carefully selected and impeccably timed spells are cast following a skillchain. Such spells exceed their typical counterparts in that they are enhanced in both power and accuracy.
    You will commonly see magic bursts abbreviated as “MB.”${prompt}
  13684: Magic bursts will not take place if the element of the spell being cast does not match the element of the skillchain preceding it.${prompt}
  13685: To take an example, a detonation skillchain, which has wind as its element, followed by an aero or other like spell, will generate a magic burst.${prompt}
  13686: In the same vein, thunder, or any cognate spell, would result in a magic burst should it follow an impaction skillchain, itself deriving power from that very element.${prompt}
  13687: As I said previously, some skillchains are associated with more than one element. Take fragmentation, for example. It is composed of equal parts wind and thunder. So chasing a fragmentation skillchain with any type of aero or thunder spell would create a magic burst.${prompt}
  13688: The key to mastering magic bursts lies in learning the elemental attributes of both the skillchains you create as well as the magic you wield. The rest is simply a matter of timing.${prompt}
  13689: For your convenience, I will go over the elemental attributes of all skillchain types. Pay close attention.${prompt}
  13690: |-
    Level 1 Skillchain (Associated element):
    Transfixion (Light), Liquefaction (Fire), Detonation (Wind),
    Impaction (Thunder), Induration (Ice), Reverberation (Water),

    Oh, my, just look at ye! How ye've grown!

  13698: And what's the pretty little number ye've got on there, eh? Looks mighty familiar, like somethin' your mother used to wear.${prompt}
  13699: You like it? It's the performance outfit for my dance troupe. I'm actually a famous dancer now, you know.${prompt}
  13700: A dance troupe, ye say? Do those things still even exist? The closest thing we have comin' to San d'Oria nowadays is that Valeriano crew, what with their fire breathin' and sword jugglin' and--${prompt}

    Um, yes, we're rather rare nowadays...
    But, more importantly, I have a favor to ask, Amaura. I need you to make that medicine again.${prompt}
  13702: Medicine, ye say? You mean the same one I brewed for your father all those years ago?${prompt}
  13703: Yes. You see, someone I know is experiencing similar symptoms...${prompt}
  13704: |-
    Is that right...?
    It breaks my heart to have to disappoint ye, dearie, but I can't make that medicine anymore.${prompt}

  13718: I hate to have to disappoint ye again, dearie, but the mature tree is what we need.${prompt}
  13719: What!?${prompt}
  13720: Try planting that bulb by the shore of an unspoilt lake.${prompt}
  13721: Once it has grown to maturity, ye'll find resin seeping out from the crack of ripened fruit. That resin, solidified, is what is needed to make our medicine.${prompt}
  13722: Alright... I'll do as you say...${prompt}
  13723: Yes, yes, that's the spirit. Ye'll have something to look forward to ten, perhaps twenty, years from now.${prompt}

    Well, pinch my cheeks and call me senile...
    What miraculous manner of magic did ye use to get a hold of this?${prompt}
  13737: Heehee, that's a trade secret. Now please, Amaura, make me the medicine!${prompt}
  13738: |-
    Very well then, I'll get started.
    But, just so ye know, this isn't some quack's instant synthesis recipe. Don't forget to breathe from time to time while ye wait!${prompt}
  13739: Ye're Lilisette's friend, aren't ye? That little ball of energy never could sit still for long...${prompt}
  13740: The medicine will be a while yet. How about doin' some household chores for old Amaura in the meantime?${prompt}

  13747: Ye're the last person who needs any remindin', but no medicine of any kind was able to save your father...${prompt}

  13750: Ohoho, it delights me so to see the beautiful young woman Lilisette's become.${prompt}
  13751: Quite a far cry from the snot-nosed crybaby who used to come runnin' to me, eyes all red, whenever the other children teased her.${prompt}
  13752: I can only imagine the solitude she must have felt, growin' up bereft of her parents.${prompt}

  13871: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.${prompt}
  13872: |-
    The synergist must provide his or her own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process.
    Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.${prompt}
  13873: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.${prompt}
  13874: |-
    Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town.
    If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.${prompt}
  13875: |-
    You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
    It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
  13876: |-
    Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
    The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
  13877: |-
    This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
    To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}
  13878: |-
    As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.
    Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.${prompt}
  13879: |-
    With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing!
    Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.${prompt}
  13880: |-
    The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
    In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!${prompt}
  13881: 'But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.${prompt}'
  13882: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.${prompt}
  13883: |-
    Take heart, though, as any materials inside your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will remain intact.
    You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.${prompt}
  13884: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.${prompt}
  13885: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  13886: |-
    Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions.
    Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!${prompt}
  13887: You may be asking yourself, “Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?”${prompt}
  13888: |-
    Here's the good news: you don't have to!
    For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.${prompt}
  13889: |-
    The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand.
    At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.${prompt}
  13890: 'Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of ${item-singular: 0[2]}, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.${prompt}'
  13891: 'Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.${prompt}'
  13892: |-
    Mind you, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it.
    Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.${prompt}
  13893: |-
    Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped.
    May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!${prompt}
  13894: |-
    First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply.
    You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.${prompt}
  13895: |-
    You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe.
    Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.${prompt}
  13896: |-
    Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy.
    If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}
  13897: |-
    You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.
    Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.${prompt}
  13898: |-
    From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
    Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
  13899: |-
    Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
    First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
  13900: |-
    Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.
    Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt}
  13901: |-
    However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions.
    Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.${prompt}
  13902: 'If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you''ll want to employ the ${color: 5}safety lever${color: 1} and ${color: 5}pressure handle${color: 1} to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.${prompt}'
  13903: |-
    You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition.
    Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.${prompt}
  13904: |-
    The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues.
    You'll need to perform periodic ${color: 5}furnace repair${color: 1} should the furnace near its breaking point.${prompt}
  13905: |-
    It is also possible to ${color: 5}recycle strewn fewell${color: 1} during synergy.
    While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.${prompt}
  13906: |-
    This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute.
    As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.${prompt}
  13907: |-
    As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable.
    There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.${prompt}
  13908: |-
    For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger.
    Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!${prompt}
  13909: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.${prompt}
  13910: |-
    In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well.
    To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.${prompt}
  13911: |-
    Now let us return to the synergy process itself.
    As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.${prompt}
  13912: |-
    If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance.
    The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.${prompt}
  13913: |-
    Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills!
    Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...${prompt}
  13914: |-
    What's an elemental surge, you ask?
    Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.${prompt}
  13915: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?${prompt}
  13916: |-
    ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell.
    There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.${prompt}
  13917: |-
    Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe.
    We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.${prompt}
  13918: |-
    Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients.
    There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.${prompt}
  13919: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.${prompt}
  13920: |-
    The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own.
    The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.${prompt}
  13921: 'In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.${prompt}'
  13922: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]} cannot be attached directly.
    First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of ${item-singular: 0[2]} can then be embedded.${prompt}
  13923: |-
    The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment.
    There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.${prompt}
  13924: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.${prompt}
  13925: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.${prompt}
  13926: |-
    You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures.
    It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.${prompt}
  13927: |-
    Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant.
    Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.${prompt}
  13928: |-
    My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale.
    The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!${prompt}
  13929: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.${prompt}
  13930: |-
    Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach.
    Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.${prompt}
  13931: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.${prompt}
  13932: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.${prompt}
  13933: 'Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call ${color: 5}revertant${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  13934: |-
    Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state!
    Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.${prompt}
  13935: |-
    As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call “fewell.”
    The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.${prompt}
  13936: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.${prompt}
  13937: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!${prompt}
  13938: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.${prompt}
  13939: |-
    That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    What could be easier?${prompt}
  13940: |-
    Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of ${item-singular: 0[2]}?
    If so, you've come to the right place!${prompt}
  13941: |-
    We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as ${color: 5}mordant${color: 1} for sale.
    With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.${prompt}
  13942: |-
    Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff.
    You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.${prompt}
  13943: |-
    Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant.
    As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.${prompt}
  13944: |-
    Ah, synergy techniques!
    Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.${prompt}
  13945: |-
    My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques.
    We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.${prompt}
  13946: |-
    Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge.
    For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.${prompt}
  13947: |-
    Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents.
    You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.${prompt}
  13948: |-
    Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer.
    These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.${prompt}
  13949: |-
    The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills.
    To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.${prompt}
  13950: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.${prompt}
  13951: |-
    Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation.
    Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.${prompt}
  13952: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.${prompt}
  13953: |-
    It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold!
    Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.${prompt}
  13954: |-
    Wondering if your ${item-singular: 0[2]} can be outfitted with evolith, are you?
    Well, you've come to the right place!${prompt}

    Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one!

    Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.${prompt}
  13975: 'Using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.${prompt}'
  13976: 'What we call ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.${prompt}'
  13977: |-
    Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists.
    The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.${prompt}
  13978: 'Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.${prompt}'
  13979: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.${prompt}
  13980: |-
    Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium.
    The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.${prompt}
  13981: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.${prompt}
  13982: 'But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.${prompt}'
  13983: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.${prompt}

    Oh, of course he'd spare an hour here or there to instruct me in swordplay.
    A gesture for which I was most thankful, to be sure.${prompt}
  14004: |-
    But this was but a diversion for him.
    That angling was his true passion was clear for all to see.${prompt}
  14005: |-
    So all-consuming was his obsession that I grew to resent him.
    What kind of father could harbor a greater love for fishing than for his own family?${prompt}
  14006: As it turns out, I had misjudged the man.${prompt}
  14007: |-
    I heard the truth from my mother one day.
    Fishing as a craft was of little interest to him, she said.${prompt}
  14008: And yet, it was an age of war, with foodstuffs few and far between.${prompt}
  14009: |-
    This is what drove my father to make the perilous journey through Jugner Forest each and every dawn.
    A desire to provide sustenance, not just to his own beloved family, but to his suffering countrymen as well.${prompt}
  14010: The father I had seen as little but a cruel taskmaster was, in fact, a deeply honorable, self-sacrificing soul.${prompt}
  14011: I was instilled with a newfound pride, and swore that one day I would instill my son with the same values that my father had stood for.${prompt}
  14012: |-
    'Tis a comical twist of fate, is it not?
    In the end, all that he inherited from his grandfather was his skill with the rod and lure.${prompt}

    Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul.
    Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  14043: By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.${prompt}
  14044: 'At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}'
  14045: Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.${prompt}
  14046: That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.${prompt}
  14047: From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.${prompt}
  14048: But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.${prompt}
  14049: The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}
  14050: |-
    Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all.
    As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.${prompt}
  14051: We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.${prompt}
  14052: 'Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level ${number: 0}. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.${prompt}'

  14859: 'While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.${prompt}'
  14860: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.${prompt}
  14861: As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.${prompt}
  14862: In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.${prompt}
  14863: To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.${prompt}
  14864: Our scouts regularly bring back intel on locations of suspected Voidwalker presence.${prompt}
  14865: Armed with this information, we dispatch strike teams to preemptively neutralize the threat.${prompt}

    Ordinarily, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.

  14867: |-
    These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team.
    They're the bare minimum we need to have a fighting chance against the enemy.${prompt}
  14868: Voidstones work by realigning your existential spectrum to match that of Voidwalkers, thus rendering the creatures visible to you.${prompt}
  14869: 'The stones are highly prized, such is the difficulty of their creation. As such, supplies are limited to ${number: 0} stones per person at any given time.${prompt}'
  14870: That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.${prompt}
  14871: The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call “Voidwalkers.”${prompt}
  14872: Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.${prompt}
  14873: Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.${prompt}
  14874: 'Possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}'
  14875: It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.${prompt}
  14876: You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.${prompt}
  14877: Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt}
  14878: In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.${prompt}
  14879: The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.${prompt}
  14880: When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  14881: Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.${prompt}
  14882: However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.${prompt}
  14883: Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.${prompt}
  14884: Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.${prompt}
  14885: But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the “existential spectrum.”${prompt}
  14886: |-
    You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned.
    In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.${prompt}
  14887: The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.${prompt}
  14888: To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
  14889: Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  14890: Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.${prompt}
  14891: One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items,” while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  14892: Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.${prompt}
  14893: All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.${prompt}
  14894: Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.${prompt}
  14895: For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.${prompt}
  14896: In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.${prompt}
  14897: Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.${prompt}
  14898: If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.${prompt}
  14899: |-
    Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company.
    It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.${prompt}
  14900: Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.${prompt}
  14901: Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.${prompt}
  14902: Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.${prompt}
  14903: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 0[2]} and ${item-plural: 1[2]} are representative of such items.
    They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.${prompt}
  14904: (Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)${prompt}
  14905: They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.${prompt}
  14906: Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.${prompt}
  14907: Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.${prompt}
  14908: 'Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.${prompt}'
  14909: |-
    Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding.
    But I digress...${prompt}
  14910: Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.${prompt}
  14911: |-
    As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch.
    Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.${prompt}
  14912: It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  14913: |-
    Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong.
    Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.${prompt}
  14914: Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.${prompt}
  14915: 'The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch''s Jeuno-based research wing.${prompt}'
  14916: Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.${prompt}
  14917: The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.${prompt}
  14918: I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.${prompt}
  14919: I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.${prompt}
  14920: Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?${prompt}
  14921: Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.${prompt}
  14922: |-
    Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them.
    Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!${prompt}
  14923: And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.${prompt}
  14924: |-
    I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really.
    Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.${prompt}
  14925: |-
    As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray.
    Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...${prompt}
  14926: Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.${prompt}
  14927: |-
    Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing.
    There exists another: stratum abyssite.${prompt}
  14928: |-
    Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite.
    Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.${prompt}
  14929: |-
    Are you familiar with ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1}?
    Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.${prompt}
  14930: |-
    As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch.
    Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.${prompt}
  14931: |-
    The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust.
    Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me?
    Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.${prompt}
  14932: |-
    At any rate, should you manage to obtain any ${color: 5}voiddust${color: 1} in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me.
    Simple enough, wouldn't you say?${prompt}
  14933: Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt}
  14934: Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.${prompt}
  14935: If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.${prompt}
  14936: |-
    Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land.
    The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt}
  14937: By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.${prompt}
  14938: Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.${prompt}
  14939: Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.${prompt}
  14940: Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.${prompt}
  14941: Keep this fact in mind at all times.${prompt}
  14942: It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.${prompt}
  14943: If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...${prompt}
  14944: Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt}
  14945: While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.${prompt}
  14946: |-
    As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants.
    There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.${prompt}
  14947: Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.${prompt}
  14948: |-
    Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite.
    If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.${prompt}
  14949: As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.${prompt}
  14950: Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.${prompt}
  14951: Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called “periapt”--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt}
  14952: Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.${prompt}

  15532: After reaching Northern San d'Oria, you are to make for Ranperre Gate. Once there, seek out Excenmille--and pray do not affront him in any fashion. The words of a hero such as he carry unmatched weight in this land.${prompt}
  15533: Do you require an explanation as to what Trust is?${prompt}
  15534: |-
    Inquire about what?
    ${selection-lines}
    What Trust is.
    What happens when one uses Trust.
    How to learn new Trust spells.
    Whereabouts of Trust participants.
    Nothing at the moment.${prompt}
  15535: Trust is a new series of magical incantations woven into being by the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies, announced at our recent symposium.${prompt}
  15536: Mayhaps the term “incantations” is a trifle misleading. Rather than draw upon aetheric manipulation, Trust taps into the spiritual connection between those bound by ${choice-player-gender}[fraternal/sororal] love.${prompt}
  15537: To lead you to my explanation's logical conclusion, I'll say this magic can be utilized regardless of its wielder's vocation. Both simple and profitable.${prompt}
  15538: As the technique is reliant upon the connection between two souls, interference by a profusion of souls, such as in cities, renders the technique unusable.${prompt}
  15539: Using Trust magic enables the caster to call forth alter egos of those with whom ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] has formed bonds of friendship and trust.${prompt}
  15540: As this technique utilizes the resonance between two kindred spirits, the alter ego which manifests always matches the caster, be they weak or strong.${prompt}
  15541: Journeys are much more satisfying when you have a companion, don't you think? The alter ego you summon will fight bravely by your side, but you will be unable to present them with detailed tactical orders.${prompt}
  15542: If you wish to return the alter ego from whence it came, you only need speak to it and express your desire. A bittersweet moment, to be sure.${prompt}
  15543: Alter egos suffer wounds just like you and I, and if one falls in battle, it will wink out of existence. To watch one so dear fade away...it brings a tear to your eye, does it not?${prompt}
  15544: Yet fret not, my disciple! After just a short while you will be able to bring it back to the world once more. Your sadness will be but whispers on the wind.${prompt}
  15545: Bringing forth an alter ego is not a simple process. You must first forge intangible bonds with those whose aid you wish to enlist.${prompt}
  15546: Carefully cultivate trust and respect between yourself and a practitioner, as this technique cannot work unless the bonds between you be surer than steel.${prompt}
  15547: Know you the adage “opposites attract”? Assuredly, such is not the case here. Storied personages have little time for those whose deeds are not sung as widely as their own.${prompt}
  15548: But all I have just told you can be circumvented, as research into new methods of calling forth alter egos has been ongoing. It is possible to summon one without having so much as met the person.${prompt}
  15549: As you can imagine, this requires a bit of tinkering with the aether, but it is indeed possible. All I require is the appropriate scroll.${prompt}
  15550: Do you wish to drink from the font of knowledge?${prompt}
  15551: '${choice: 3}[Excenmille/Naji/Kupipi/Curilla/Ayame/Nanaa Mihgo/Trion/Volker/Ajido-Marujido/Iron Eater/Prishe/Ulmia/Shikaree Z/Cherukiki/Gadalar/Zazarg/Nashmeira/Gessho/Ingrid/Maat/Arciela/Chacharoon] can be found in ${choice: 2}[San d''Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Tavnazia/Aht Urhgan/Adoulin/the Mod Gardens].${prompt}'

  15554: Funny story, that. They are also involved in the Trust initiative.${prompt}
  15555: I must bow my head in appreciation for all that you and your ilk have done for us. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.${prompt}
  15556: I am more than pleased to report that your activities on our behalf have aided the institute in posting never-before-seen results.${prompt}
  15557: Always cherish the bonds you have formed with that person, for such resilient ties take years--decades!--to form.${prompt}
  15558: May your trust and friendship blossom into the envy of all!${prompt}
  15559: Wh-who? This old mind does not work like it used to, for I know not one whit about that person.${prompt}
  15560: Bah! What exactly am I supposed to do with this pile of nonsense?${prompt}
  15561: But lest you think otherwise, it is the parchment to blame. Some strange energy prevents it from being properly read.${prompt}
  15562: '${color-alt: 138}You cannot read this cipher due to an event occurring in Rhapsodies of Vana''diel.'
  15563: Even I cannot tell who this cipher is supposed to call. Let me get out my reading glasses and take a gander, hmm?${prompt}
  15564: Oho! A strange apparition, you say?${prompt}
  15565: Glad I could help you reach even greater heights. May you enjoy many bright years with your new companion.${prompt}
  15566: Though I perhaps should not share this information with one not of the institute, lately we have been pushing the limits of the Trust initiative beyond just the five races.${prompt}
  15567: Let us get down to business, you say? Use these newfound powers?${prompt}
  15568: Then we shall commune together. Close your eyes, and let the powers of trust, friendship, and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love fill every ilm of your body.${prompt}
  15569: A marvelous spectacle, if I do say so myself!${prompt}
  15570: Now you owe me not one, but two! Tohoho, how great it is to have the upper hand!${prompt}
  15571: You know about this all-important Trust initiative already? Rumors truly do spread like wildfire on a dry summer day.${prompt}
  15572: Whether my compatriots in Bastok or Windurst informed you is of little consequence. What matters most is that you are here--and wish to engage in the trials we San d'Orians can offer.${prompt}
  15573: 'Oh ho! Is that ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} you have there mayhap?${prompt}'
  15574: Doctor Monberaux is a doctor of much renown throughout Jeuno. I have been meaning to have him take a look at my creaky old back.${prompt}
  15575: By the by, when we spoke with him about helping us with our Trust magic, he asked if his friend could join too.${prompt}
  15576: It seems his friend Wolf-something is quite popular with ladies of a certain age such as Ilumida. He received quite a glowing recommendation.${prompt}
  15577: Unfortunately, things ended up being a bit complicated. No, it was not like anybody was jealous of him or anything.${prompt}
  15578: Now, where was I... Oh yes, we were talking about Doctor Monberaux. Close your eyes, and let the powers of trust, friendship, and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love fill every ilm of your body.${prompt}
  15579: A marvelous spectacle, if I do say so myself!${prompt}
  15580: Now you owe me not one, but two! Tohoho, how great it is to have the upper hand!${prompt}
  15581: Never in my wildest dreams did I expect to find obscure crabs in someone's Mog Garden. I must make preparations for a survey this instant.${prompt}

    I have other questions.
    Nothing for now.${prompt}
  15584: I can mark the locations of important people on your map of the San d'Oria area, should you require it.${prompt}
  15585: You can find a map peddler taking refuge in the shade of a tree to the southwest, near the gate to West Ronfaure.${prompt}
  15586: There is an elderly woman near the fountain due south of here who will be more than happy to sell you maps.${prompt}
  15587: There are people willing to sell you maps in both Northern and Southern San d'Oria, but the vendor in Northern San d'Oria is closer...if you are in a hurry.${prompt}
  15588: Our kingdom has prepared a special tour of duty for newly enlisted troops such as you. Hopefully you make the best of it.${prompt}
  15589: To begin the journey, simply talk to Alaune in Southern San d'Oria. She resides near the gate to West Ronfaure.${prompt}
  15590: To rendezvous with her, head directly south and pass through the gate leading to Southern San d'Oria.${prompt}
  15591: To rendezvous with her, ascend the stairs that lead southwest, which should take you to Northern San d'Oria.${prompt}
  15592: Once there, proceed southward until you reach Southern San d'Oria.${prompt}
  15593: I shall mark her position upon your map so you may locate her more easily once you are in that vicinity.${prompt}
  15594: It is possible to check who has been marked on your map by opening the “Map” menu, selecting the “Markers” option, and then scrolling to the right.${prompt}
  15595: Performing a “Wide Scan” from the “Map” menu also allows you to locate people in your vicinity, should that method prove more convenient.${prompt}
  15596: Whether decorated in battle or recently enlisted, all can benefit from trying their hand at Records of Eminence. It is a simple method for participating in Vana'diel's many adventures, and bestows rewards all its own.${prompt}
  15597: Open the main menu, go right to get to the next screen, and select “Objective List” under the “Quests” submenu.${prompt}
  15598: Select “Tutorial,” head to “Basics,” and accept the objective “First Step Forward” to get started down this magnificent road.${prompt}

  15601: Records of Eminence contains a plethora of objectives, many of which will surely fit your play style. It would behoove you to take advantage of this opportunity.${prompt}
  15602: The Trust initiative is a special magic regimen developed by one of the world's finest academies of magic.${prompt}
  15603: Those who successfully undergo training will be bestowed with the ability to call forth powerful allies into battle.${prompt}
  15604: Only adventurers who have proven their worth by achieving level five are eligible to participate. I will provide you with further information when you reach that landmark.${prompt}
  15605: Gondebaud is their representative, and he is stationed in Southern San d'Oria. I shall mark his location on your map should you desire to make further inquiries.${prompt}
  15606: If you harbor doubts about something I have not yet touched upon, first open the main menu. From there, scroll right to the second page and select the “Help Desk” option.${prompt}
  15607: Once you have done that, select “Help Desk” again from the list of categories that appears in the new window. Finally, enter the section entitled “I need help with the game controls.”${prompt}

  15674: Finally, never forget to check your spoils of war.${prompt}
  15675: Tasks issued by residents of the city for you to complete are called “quests.” Simply fulfill the requirements, such as procuring the desired item, to receive a reward.${prompt}
  15676: On the other hand, orders handed down directly from those involved with the nation's administration are called “missions.” Converse with the guard by the gate for a more detailed explanation.${prompt}

  16012: Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).${prompt}
  16013: Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.${prompt}
  16014: “Wanted” objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.${prompt}

  16016: Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.${prompt}

  16022: When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.${prompt}
  16023: Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  16024: No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.${prompt}
  16025: You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.${prompt}
  16026: An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.${prompt}
  16027: One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.${prompt}
  16028: A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.${prompt}
  16029: You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.${prompt}
  16030: Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.${prompt}
  16031: Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.${prompt}
  16032: Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.${prompt}
  16033: The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.${prompt}
  16034: It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.${prompt}
  16035: The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.${prompt}
  16036: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.${prompt}
  16037: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.${prompt}
  16038: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.${prompt}
  16039: 'Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of ${number: 0} accolades per week (Earth time).${prompt}'
  16040: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.${prompt}
  16041: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.${prompt}
  16042: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.${prompt}
  16043: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.${prompt}
  16044: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.${prompt}
  16045: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.${prompt}
  16046: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.${prompt}
  16047: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.${prompt}
  16048: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.${prompt}
  16049: 'Additionally, an individual''s evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by ${number: 0}. A Unity''s ranking is the average of all eligible members'' individual evaluations.${prompt}'
  16050: The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.${prompt}
  16051: Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.${prompt}
  16052: 'Those with evaluations of ${number: 0} or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.${prompt}'
  16053: Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.${prompt}
  16054: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.${prompt}
  16055: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.${prompt}
  16056: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.${prompt}
  16057: It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.${prompt}
  16058: Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.${prompt}

  16154: Though it had originally been regarded as but a minor artifact, in the future you and my father had drawn forth its true power.${prompt}
  16155: In reality, it is a piece of the mothercrystal.${prompt}
  16156: Please, Master. You may have taken the first steps, but I urge you to continue pressing on.${prompt}
  16157: Gilgamesh awaits word in Norg.${prompt}

  16160: But the spirits which protect Reisenjima Sanctorium have gone silent...${prompt}

  16406: I assume she has also rated your technique as highly as I do. Yes, it is always nice to receive validation, especially from those outside of our own circle.${prompt}
  16407: Shall we begin? First, you will need the recipe. This is important, so please try not to forget it.${prompt}
  16408: 'Let me see... For the necessary ingredients, you first need to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  16409: 'This particular item is used to increase the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its maximum value.${prompt}'

  16411: 'You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt}'
  16412: Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.${prompt}
  16413: In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt}
  16414: You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt}
  16415: That's all it says.${prompt}
  16416: 'Once you have increased the Craftsmanship, come show the shield to me and I''ll make the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}'

  16421: Don't tell me you forgot the recipe! Fine. Here it is again. Professionals really only need to hear these things once, you know.${prompt}
  16422: Yes, you really have come a long way and are capable of making all kinds of wonderful things. I'm sure this will be no different.${prompt}

  16426: 'Oh, I''m not sure if this is related, but in creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it seems to have reduced the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  16427: 'I don''t surmise it to be much of a problem to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but you might need to increase the Craftsmanship again if you ever need to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  16428: That is clearly just a hypothetical of course. I mean, you would have to lose the item in order to need to make another one and you're much too responsible to let that happen.${prompt}
  16429: 'Wait, are you trying to tell me that you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  16430: 'I suppose it can''t be helped. Here, I''ll make you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Let me see your shield.${prompt}'
  16431: You are better than this. Losing important ingredients is something I expect from an apprentice, not you.${prompt}
  16432: Ahh, I see you've made the upgrade. Do you mind if I take a closer look?${prompt}
  16433: This is astonishing. The shape has changed, and I can feel a small surge of power emanating from it. Although, it is clearly still a work in progress.${prompt}
  16434: Yes, I remember her saying that you needed to craft multiple times before it would reach the level you want it to be.${prompt}
  16435: That reminds me, she wanted me to mark the shield when it was done. If I may?${prompt}
  16436: There, that should do it.${prompt}
  16437: Show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and you'll be set.${prompt}
  16438: Oh, and please note that I often have deliveries for Wolden-Bolden. I hope you'll help me in my efforts to educate the more junior members of the guild.${prompt}
  16439: Oh, I have been expecting you. She said you might come asking about how to upgrade the shield.${prompt}
  16440: Allow me to tell you the recipe. This is important, so please try to remember it.${prompt}
  16441: Did you get all of that?${prompt}
  16442: 'Now, let me explain how to obtain the ingredients, starting with the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}'
  16443: 'You crafted while equipping the aspis before to increase its Craftsmanship, right? This is basically the same thing, as you will be equipping the ${item-singular: 0[2]} this time around.${prompt}'
  16444: However, you will really need to pour your spirit into the shield this time. It seems rather difficult compared to the last one.${prompt}
  16445: 'Once the shield''s Craftsmanship reaches 100%, bring it to me and I will make the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}'
  16446: 'Next, in regards to the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and ${item-singular: 3[2]}, I have left them with Wolden-Bolden.${prompt}'
  16447: 'Last is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. For it, I have enlisted the help of the A.M.A.N. to prepare some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt}'
  16448: 'You will receive the ${item-singular: 4[2]} once you complete them. Please refer to the Records of Eminence menu for more details.${prompt}'
  16449: That covers the ingredients. I imagine it will take some time to gather them all, but I am positive that you can do it. Good luck.${prompt}
  16450: Well? Did you increase the shield's Craftsmanship?${prompt}
  16451: 'Excellent. I will create the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you now.${prompt}'
  16452: Here you go.${prompt}
  16453: 'Look what happened here... It seems creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]} lowered the shield''s Craftsmanship rating.${prompt}'
  16454: It would be quite cumbersome to have to create another one, so please take care of it until you are ready to craft with it.${prompt}
  16455: Very well done! So this is what became of those ingredients. It is a shining example of absolute perfection!${prompt}
  16456: In addition, I am feeling a power emanating from the shield that was not present last time. I cannot wait to see what the next upgrade will bring!${prompt}
  16457: Now, I just need to mark the shield for you and we will be finished.${prompt}
  16458: There you go. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap when you get a chance.${prompt}
  16459: How disappointing... Although, it does us no good to worry about it. You can have another try at completing the final objective.${prompt}
  16460: Welcome. Have you come to upgrade your shield? Very well, I shall explain the recipe to you...${prompt}
  16461: Oh, so you've already heard the recipe and how to obtain some of the materials.${prompt}
  16462: 'I guess that just leaves the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}.${prompt}'
  16463: Basically, I would like your help with some orders that were placed with our guild. I need you to deliver the products to the customers.${prompt}
  16464: However, you can't just take the items to them because we've been requested to make the products on site.${prompt}
  16465: Some materials and other items are exempt, but basically you need to make all of the items where the customer can see you or they won't be accepted.${prompt}
  16466: Do you think I could ask you to gather the materials needed to make the items?${prompt}
  16467: By the way, we have reached an agreement with the other guilds to sell some of their items on a trial basis, including some you normally can't buy.${prompt}
  16468: Speak to the crafting set vendor in each guild to see which items are available. Hopefully it will prove useful for you.${prompt}
  16469: Oh, you should keep in mind that you might not always be able to buy the items you are looking for.${prompt}
  16470: 'After you have completed all of the requests, I shall give you the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}.${prompt}'
  16471: 'This is the ${choice: 0}[first/next/final] request.${prompt}'
  16472: 'Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Diadonour at the watch tower in ${unknown: 0x01053782E48080}.${prompt}'

  16476: Oh yes, you do not need to craft this particular item near the customer.${prompt}
  16477: Please report back to me once the delivery is finished.${prompt}
  16478: Hmm... Your current request is as follows...${prompt}
  16479: So, how is the request going?${prompt}

  16483: |-
    Will you see this through?
    ${selection-lines}
    I'll do my best.
    I've had enough.${prompt}
  16484: I see... I am sorry to have placed such a burden on you. I shall look for another craftsman to take on this particular task for me.${prompt}
  16485: Yes, you should really try to get some rest. I can prepare another job for you after you are feeling better.${prompt}
  16486: Ahh, you are looking much better now. Just in time too, as I have a new job for you.${prompt}
  16487: It is good to see you again. I see you finished the delivery. Thank you for that.${prompt}
  16488: Oh! I see you have finished the last delivery. Thank you for all of your hard work.${prompt}
  16489: 'I always keep my word, so here are the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${item-singular: 1[2]} as promised.${prompt}'
  16490: If you ever lose them, you can trade guild points for a replacement.${prompt}
  16491: This process is almost like second nature to me now.${prompt}
  16492: So, this is what the shield looks like this time around...${prompt}
  16493: I am speechless. Would you consider letting me put it on display here in the guild?${prompt}
  16494: Hahaha... I am just joking of course. Our mutual friend seems to think that the next upgrade will unlock the shield's ultimate power. I wonder if she's right...${prompt}
  16495: Oh, before you go, I want you to have something. I think a craftsman of your ability will be able to use this crafting technique capably. Consider it a present from me for all of your hard work.${prompt}
  16496: Welcome. I see you have reached the final upgrade. I have managed to prepare the necessary materials for you.${prompt}
  16497: Allow me to explain how to obtain the necessary materials.${prompt}
  16498: 'First, you will need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}'
  16499: I have left them with Wolden-Bolden. In other words, you can obtain them by exchanging crafter points. How many do you have saved so far?${prompt}
  16500: 'You will also need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. For it, you will need to follow the same procedure as before, showing me your shield once its Craftsmanship has reached 100%.${prompt}'
  16501: 'That covers the ingredients. It is exciting to know that you are so close to finishing this process. I am looking forward to seeing the end result.${prompt} '
  16502: That reminds me, Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno is planning to use this, right? Please try not to lose it when making the delivery.${prompt}
  16503: Hm? Is something the matter? You look like you want to ask me something...${prompt}
  16504: Hmm... This item you mention sounds like the one a Tarutaru from Adoulin requested me to make.${prompt}
  16505: So, I apologize, but you are too late. I already sent it off to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.${prompt}
  16506: Perhaps you should return to Jeuno and see if it has been delivered yet?${prompt}
  16507: I have no idea how this happened... This is the emblem you were looking for, right? It seems it was just sitting on the shelf here in my shop.${prompt}
  16508: You need this for something? No problem. I originally made it for you anyway. Feel free to do with it as you wish.${prompt}
  16509: Would you look at this!${prompt}
  16510: It looks like you finally finished. It really is quite amazing! I like the way our guild's emblem looks on it too.${prompt}
  16511: I really put my heart and soul into making that emblem! It will serve as the perfect symbol of our guild when you equip the shield.${prompt}
  16512: Although it has nothing to do with you completing the shield, I have prepared a small gift for you. It is a new crafting technique.${prompt}
  16513: I know that you have the skill to make good use of it. I look forward to seeing you take on all-new challenges with it and that magnificent shield!${prompt}

  16608: |-
    Read the manual?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sure.
    No thanks.${prompt}
  16609: Mandragora Mania Madness is a game in which players battle by placing different colored game pieces on a 4x4 playing area.${prompt}
  16610: You use the white pieces (mandragoras), while your opponent uses the black pieces (corrigans).${prompt}
  16611: The player to go first is determined randomly when the game begins. You will be able to adjust these settings yourself from the second game onward.${prompt}
  16612: The first player to place four pieces so they align in a row will be declared the winner.${prompt}
  16613: However, you will automatically be disqualified if you ever place three of your pieces in a row, so be mindful of your moves at all times.${prompt}
  16614: Note that if you place your game pieces so that you have both three and four pieces in a row, the row with four pieces will take precedence and you will win the game.${prompt}
  16615: If you place a game piece on either side of your opponent's piece, you will convert it into one of your pieces.${prompt}
  16616: You can play anywhere from three to five games, and the first player to win three games is the winner.${prompt}
  16617: Now, for an explanation on points.${prompt}
  16618: |-
    You receive points after the completion of each game.
    The points are tallied using units known as mandy.${prompt}
  16619: |-
    If you win the game, you will receive a number of points equal to the number of game pieces you have on the board.
    In the example shown, you will earn 8 mandy.${prompt}
  16620: Even if you lose the game, you will receive a number of points equal to half the number of your game pieces on the board (rounded off to avoid fractions).${prompt}
  16621: The first player to win three games gets to keep all of the points they have earned, although you won't get any points if you quit partway.${prompt}
  16622: Occasionally, you might get to play a bonus game, where your pieces are pink (adenium) or feature a watermelon pattern (citrullus).${prompt}
  16623: 'They are worth ${number: 0}x and ${number: 1}x the points, respectively, giving you the chance to quickly score a large number of points.${prompt}'
  16624: The key to victory is to not just try and place four pieces in a row, but to position your pieces in a way that forces your opponent to place three pieces in a row.${prompt}
  16625: See? Is very easy! Ready to give try?${prompt}
  16626: You get mandy if you win or lose, but not if you quit partway!${prompt}
  16627: Can trade mandy for many goodies.${prompt}
  16628: Then I just give one piece of advice.${prompt}
  16629: You get mandy if you win or lose, but not if you quit partway!${prompt}
  16630: You can look at manual later if you need reminder on how to play.${prompt}
